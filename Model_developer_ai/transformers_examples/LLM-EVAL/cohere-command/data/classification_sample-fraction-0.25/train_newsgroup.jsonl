That was certainly partially the case with Apollo,\n   but real Lunar colonies will probably require a continuing\n   military, scientific, or commercial reason for being rather than\n   just a \"we have the money, why not?\" approach.\n\nAh, but the whole point is that money spent on a lunar base is not\nwasted on the moon. It's not like they'd be using $1000 (1000R?) bills\nto fuel their moon-dozers. The money to fund a lunar base would be\nspent in the country to which the base belonged. It's a way of funding\nhigh-tech research, just like DARPA was a good excuse to fund various\nfields of research, under the pretense that it was crucial to the\ndefense of the country, or like ESPRIT is a good excuse for the EC to\nfund research, under the pretense that it's good for pan-European\ncooperation.\n\nNow maybe you think that government-funded research is a waste of\nmoney (in fact, I'm pretty sure you do), but it does count as\ninvestment spending, which does boost the economy (and just look at\nthe size of that multiplier :->).","label":"sci.space"}

All present Macs support the use of \n32-bit color through 32-bit color QuickDraw in ROM.  32-bit color QuickDraw \nallows an almost transparent capability to display and edit X-bit images in Y-\nbit color and retain ALL the colors of Y-bit color [Where X and Y \nindependently are 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, or 32] regardless of monitor resolution {63 \ndpi [12\" color] to 94 dpi [PaletteBook]} or monitor type {including \nautosynchronous VGA, MCGA and SVGA monitors with ranges including 66.7 hz \nvertically and 35 kHz horizontally and only a hardware video adaptor (MacUser \nAug 1992: 158-176).  Older machines that supported color {SE/30, II, IIX, and \nIIcx} had only 8-bit color in ROM and needed a software patch to use 32-bit \ncolor (MacUser Special 1993:28-29).  \nTo keep costs down and speed up most Macs have only 8 or 16 bit display \ncapability built-in, but most of those can be expanded to display 24-bit \ncolor.    Presently QuickDraw is optimized for 72 dpi display; QuickDraw QX \nwill change this.\nIn addition, QuickDraw allows, in Macs with a NuBus slot, more then one \nmonitor to be used in any combination, from two monitors showing the same \nthing to multiple monitors acting as one large large monitor with any degree \nof overlap of the pictures.\nVRAM: Video RAM.  Standard for present non-PowerBook Mac's handling of \n built-in video {from a 32-bit color palette}. VRAM provided runs a 8-bit\n color 640x480 display; expandable to 16-bit color or a 8-bit 832x624 display. \nSound output:  Standard in all Macs since the 128K.

In addition, IBM and clone makers never bothered to provide a \nstandard hardware mechanism for software to determine what display mode is \nactually present (Matt Healy) nor a standardized screen-drawing toolbox {like \nMac's QD}. As a result the OS must be very well written to detect some modes, \nespecially with some third party cards or to use them consitantly {At present \nthings are so dependent on the interaction of the program, OS, print driver \nand monitor card that editing 32-bit pictures regardless of color mode, OS, \nand monitor type/card combination as one can do on the Mac is impossible with \nan IBM.  For example, one cannot edit a 32-bit color picture done on a OS/2 \n486 with a SVGA monitor on a 386 with VGA {18-bit color palette} and DOS 5.0 \nand still have ALL the colors one started out with}.\nLater IBM machines will have integrated graphics accelerators, faster \nprocessors, and modular upgradeability and may have built-in sound cards, CD \nROM, and Ethernet (PC Week 12/14/92).  \nMDA: Monocrome Display Adapter\n original character-mapped video mode, no graphics, 80x25 text.\nCGA: Color Graphics Array\n 320x200 4 colors or 640x200 b/w, 16 color palette, bad for the eyes.\nEGA:  Enhanced Graphics Array\n 640x350 16 colors from 64 color palette [and some lower res]; some versions \n could run at 256 colors, bearable on the eyes.\nVGA:  Video Graphics Array*\n 320x200 at 256 colors, 640x480 at 16 colors, and some others, these two are \n the most commonly used.

As such, with each manufacturer \n using their own implementation scheme, SVGA was chaos with people debating\n as to what is SVGA and what is not.  In an effort to make SVGA more of a \n standard VESA was established and is used in the newer units, but things\n are still a mess.  Video is either 512K [~1990] or 1M [today], resolution\n of 800x600 and 1024x768 at 16 and 256 colors are common, newer ones [since \n 1990] have the Sierra HiColor RAMDAC, giving 15-bit 32,768 colors at 800x600, \n some of the very newer ones [~6/92] can do 24 bits per pixel [usually \n at 640x480].  Speedwise, too much variation, some very slow [Western Digital \n Paradise based, for example], some very fast [S3 86C911 based, for example], \n some are so-so [like Tseng ET4000, a very popular chipset].  Some limiting \n factors overcome by 40MHz VL Bus & 386's linear address mapping were: \n 8.33 MHz ISA bus, AT architecture where the CPU looks at the card through a \n 64K \"window\", etc.\nOther non-SVGA standards: \n8514/a:\n IBM's own standard, interlacing graphics accelerator with graphics functions \n like linedraw, polygon fill, etc. in hardware. Some clone implementations \n from ATI are the fastest video available today, though some clone models do \n not have interlacing. \nTMS34010/34020: high end graphics co-processors, usually >$1000, some\n do 24-bit, speeds up vector-oriented graphics like CAD.\nXGA:  eXtended Graphics Array\n newer and faster than 8514/a, only available for MCA bus-based PS/2s, clones \n are coming out soon.

Any other set up causes problems for either Mac or IBM}. \nSCSI-1:  7 devices per SCSI controller.  8-bit asynchronous {~1.5MB/s ave}\n and synchronous {5MB/s max} transfers.  Difference is due to SCSI-1 software\n drivers.  \"Fast SCSI-1\" is a misname for 8-bit SCSI-2 in SCSI-1 mode\n {see SCSI-2 for details}.\nSCSI-2: 10 devices per SCSI controller in SCSI-2 mode.  SCSI-2 is fully\n SCSI-1 compliant and 8-bit SCSI-2 tends to be implemented as a very fast\n SCSI-1 since it does not require the different controller interfaces in  \n hardware and software that 16 and 32-bit SCSI-2 do.  Transfer speeds are\n 4-6MB/s with 10MB/s burst {8-bit}, 8-12MB/s with 20MB/s burst {16-bit}, and\n 15-20MB/s with 40MB/s burst {32-bit/wide and fast}.  Since 8-bit SCSI-2 can\n use SCSI-1 software drivers and hardware at 8-bit SCSI-2 speeds and as such\n is limited to 7 devices sometimes it is mistakenly called \"fast SCSI-1\". \n 16-bit fast SCSI-2 requires a SCSI-2 software driver and SCSI-2 electronics\n but can still use the SCSI-1 ports.  Wide 16-bit and 32-bit SCSI-2 require a\n different SCSI port, electronics, and software driver from SCSI-1 {Which\n makes them more expensive than other SCSI interfaces}.\nMac SCSI: asynchronous SCSI-1 built-in standard since the Plus.  Even though \n Apple developed some specifications for SCSI controlers, the OS SCSI Manager\n needs to be rewritten to take full advantage of the features of both SCSI\n interfaces.  As a result present SCSI-2 Macs use 8-bit SCSI-2 as a fast \n asynchronous SCSI-1.  Presently Quadras are the only Macs with a SCSI-2\n controller chip built-in (Digital Review, Oct 21, 1991 v8 n33 p8(1)) \n though they lack some other parts of the hardware, like the wide SCSI-2 port \n interface.  Since other Macs require a NuBus card to use SCSI-2, older NuBus \n Macs had a bottleneck due to the speed of the NuBus and CPU.  Rumor-some\n Cyclone Macs {June} will come with a wide & fast SCSI-2 port standard \n and have a rewritten OS SCSI manager.\nIBM SCSI:  SCSI-1 is not too wide spread yet, generally not bundled with \n systems, except as add-on {EISA and VESA Local Bus adapters avalable}.\n Like the Mac, 8-bit SCSI-2 is used as a very fast SCSI-1 by most controllers\n out there.  Unlike the Mac, IBM has no exact SCSI controller specifications\n which results in added incompatibilities for SCSI.\n\nMac\nMemory expansion: with a few exceptions the Mac has used non-parity 30-pin \n 8-bit SIMM memory expansion since the Plus.  While 32-pin 9-bit parity SIMMs\n could be used in these Macs, only special IIcis could make use of the parity \n feature {By convension both SIMM types are called 32-pin SIMMs}.  The IIfx \n used 64-pin parity SIMMs.  The LC III, C610/650 and Q800 all use a new \n 72-pin SIMM that is accessable by 32-bits at a time and is used in IBMs.\n The Mac does a complete memory check at startup by writing/reading every\n memory location; if something is seriously wrong with a SIMM the Mac will\n not boot and give a sound chord indicating what the problem is.\n Since Macs made before Feb 15, 1993 managed memory baced on data path, SIMMs \n had to be installed in pairs {16-bit} or in sets of 4 {32-bit}.  The Centris \n 650 and Quadra 800 eliminate this with a new memory management setup that \n allows memory to be upgraded one SIMM at a time.  If the SIMMs are the same \n size are used then the memory is 'interleaved' across the two SIMMs resulting \n in a 10-15% performance boost on RAM access (MacWorld Apr 93: 108-109).\nPrinters, ADBs, and modems: built-in interfaces standard.\nMonitor interface and sound input: built-in on most present macs. \nPDS: Available in SE & all present non-Powerbook Macs. 16-bit {SE, \n Portable, LC, LC II, Classic line} and 32-bit.  Operates at CPU's MHz.  \n Maximum through put: data path in bytes*CPU's MHz {Q700/900 & C650: \n 4 * 25Mhz = 100MB/s; Q800 & Q950: 4 * 33Mhz = 132MB/s}. Standardized with\n the LC and 040 bus designs.  With an adapter one NuBus card can be used in \n IIsi and C610.  Problem: some cards have timing dependency which slows \n through put down.\nNuBus Mac II: 32-bit, 10 MHz bus clock, 1-to-1 transaction/bus cycle ratio,\n and contiguous, hand-shake transactions at ~10-20MB/s; theoretical peak:\n 40MB/s.  Built-in on all Modular Macs except the LC series, C610, and \n Performa 400.  The SE/30 could be adapted to use this and there was even a \n Mac Plus SCSI NuBus.  Supports every possible expansion from CPU to Ethernet \n to DMA.\nNuBus 90: NuBus Mac II back compatable. 20MHz bus clock, avg throughput:\n ~30MB/s; burst mode: 80MB/s.  Future card designs will be 7\" instead of the \n old 12\".\nQuickRing:  A peer-to-peer bus used in parallel with NuBus 90.  Apple's \n VLBus - \"Architecture is identical to that of VLBus\" (Byte 10/92:128).\n Burst mode: 350MB/s (Byte 10/92:128). In development.\nCPU expansion: handled either through the PDS or the NuBus.  Unlike PDS,  \n Nubus CPU cards {example-Radius Rocket} allow use of multiple processors at \n the same time.  This is like having two or more Macs in the same box able to \n dual task or joinly process depending on the card or software involved {Each \n NuBus card needs its own memory but most NuBus cards of this type come with \n 8MB RAM SIMMs on the card standard}.\n\nIBM\nMemory expansion:  parity SIMMs, non-parity SIMMs {some newer models do a Mac-\nlike SIMM memory check}, or a dozen or so different types of memory boards.\n\nHD Interfaces {limited to hard drives by design or lack of development}: \nMFM:  Modified Frequency Modulation, RLL:  Run Length Limited\n only used with smaller [\u00b2 60mb] hard drives.\nIDE:  Integrated Device Electronics \n Asynchronous {~5MB/s max} and synchronous {8.3MB/s max} transfer.\n currently the most common standard, and is mainly used for medium sized \n drives. Can have more than one hard drive. \nESDI:  Enhanced Small Device Interface\n ~1.25MB/s throughput. generally considered better interface than SCSI-1 in\n many ways but not common enough for practical consideration.  Outside of\n hard drives, device choices are very limited compared to SCSI-1. \n\nBUS interfaces\n{New 'plug and play' ISA and EISA compatable cards may have problems working \nwith old cards (InfoWorld; PC Week 03/08/93; Vaporware 4/93).}\nISA\n 8 & 16-bit interfaces common. Has 24-bit data path limit {which produces a\n 16MB limit for which there are software workarounds} (PC Mag 4/27/93:105).\n 1.5 MB/s (Byte 3/93:132).  Uses edge-triggered interrupts, can't share them,\n hence comes the IRQ conflict.  Limited busmastering capabilities, some cards\n aren't bandwidth limited {COM  ports, LPT ports, game ports, MIDI card, etc.}\n while others are {video and disk controllers}.  Dominant factor, but it's\n showing its age.  Most ISA motherboard designs are 16-bit\n (PC World Feb 1993: 144-5)}.  \nMCA {Micro Channel}\n IBM's 16 and 32-bit bus; \"allows use of more than one CPU in a computer\" \n (DCT) and anything can talk to anything, as fast as the two components \n involved can handle it. Never took off because it was incompatible with ISA \n and EISA.  Planned to be bus interface of IBM PowerPC 601 (Carl Jabido).\nEISA {NuBus Mac II is closest Mac equivalent}\n 32-bit, 8.33 MHz, burst mode: 33MB/s.  It also has the ability to \n self-configure cards like MCA and allows multiple bus masters, sharable \n interrupt and DMA channels and multiple CPU use.\nVESA Local Bus: VLB {Sometimes mistakenly refereed to as PDS}\n Local Bus standard. Runs at CPU clock rate,  Burst modes: ~130 MB/s{32-bit}\n 250 MB/s{64-bit} (Byte 10/92:128).  Limited to three slots but allows bus \n mastering and will coexist with either ISA or EISA. Consitered ideal for \n video and disk I/O.  DELL has filled a claim that this violates one of\n their patents (Mel Martinez).\nQuickRing: Apple's faster {350 MB/s burst} version of VLB architecture\n (Byte 10/92:132).  Might show up in some IBM and PowerPC machines\n (Byte 10/92:132-133). In development.\nPCI\n Intel's version of Local Bus that is intended to totally replace \n ISA/EISA/MCA.  In development.\n\nOSes {assumes full installation [print drivers, fonts, Multifinder, etc.]\nand multiple application use.}\nMac\n512K to 1MB of OS and hardware commands have been put into ROM.  This allows \nApple to control its machine by putting key hooks for the Mac OS {QuickDraw, \nmenu commands, print, mouse, SCSI & sound drivers, etc} in ROM, which require \nclone makers to use the ROM chip or read ROM on to disks {Which requires \naccess to the proper Mac since different Macs have slightly different ROM \nchips; Plus vs Classic for example.}  With key hooks for the OS support \ninterface in ROM, programers do not have to worry as much whether the disk OS \nhas the necessary hardware commands or that those commands are consitant and \ntherefore can write smaller programs.  This also allows Apple greater control \nover hardware-software standards and that the disk OS can be smaller and, with \nsome of the tookbox command code in ROM, with lower RAM requirements then a \ntotally disk based OS.  Macs use Masked ROM which is as fast as DRAM (Jon \nWtte).\n6.0.7: Single program usage base requirements: 1 MB and DD floppy, \n cooperatively-multitasking base requirements: 2MB and HD floppy.  \n Features a GUI, cooperative-multitasker [MultiFinder], standard program \n interface, & standard stereo sound support [snd]. Network receiving part of \n AppleShare software is bundled with the OS. Has a 8MB RAM barrier and is a \n 24-bit OS. Some third party products allow 14MB of Virtual Memory as long as \n real RAM is below 8MB.\n6.0.8: 6.0.7 with 7.0.0 print drivers.\n6.0.8L:  System 6 for some Macs that require System 7.0.X.\n7.0.X: Base requirements: 2MB, 40MB Hard Drive, and 68000; De-facto standard \n to run all features well: 4MB, 80MB Hard Drive, and 68030 {lowest present \n non-portable Mac configuration}.  Using up to 10.08MB {This is EVERYTHING on\n system disks} of hard disk space this has 6.0.7 features plus program linking \n within and between computers [IAC], built-in server capabilities {Filesharing \n can be used by older OSes using AppleShare Client software and can be \n accessed by 10 macs max; 4-5 is more speed practical, IAC requires 7.X}, \n Virtual Memory in machines with MMU{1.6 times real RAM for least noticeable \n IIsi speed degradation}, drag and drop, QuickTime & built-in TrueType \n support.  Supports sound input [AIFF and snd formats] for most present \n machines.  Can access up to 1GB of true RAM and 4GB of virtual memory and is \n both a 24 and 32-bit OS.  To use real RAM beyond 8MB it must be in 32-bit \n mode and on older machines requires the 'Mode 32' extension.  Apple's last \n 'free' OS.\n7.1.0: 7.0.1 with WorldScript support, speedier, and less RAM usage than \n 7.0.dot (MacWeek 8/24/92; 9/14/92; PC Week 9/7/92). To run in 32-bit mode \n on older machines it requires the 'Mode 32' or '32-Bit Enabler' extension. \n Marks the start of Apple saling its Mac OS instead of allowing free upgrades\n {Bundled with new machines, $49 for 7.0.X upgrades, $99 otherwise}.\n [The installer has a bug that when upgrading it may keep some old system \n fonts from the previous system inside the system file.  This can eat up any \n RAM benefits and cause other problems.  Apple itself recommends removing all \n fonts from the system file.]\nA/UX 3.0 [UNIX]: Needs 8MB RAM {12-20MB suggested}, 160MB hard drive, and \n a 68030 or 68040 equivalent to run.  This 32-bit preemptive multitasking OS \n is large due to being UNIX and needing translators between it and the Mac \n ROMs.  Price: $709.\nNote: sound output was supported in OSes 3.2 to 6.0.5 by many formats \nincluding the following:  snd, WAVE, ASND, FSSD, QSSN, SMSD, SOUN, dc2d, and \nDCFL.  In 6.0.7 the sound manager was optimized for the sound standards 'snd' \nand AIFF which causes some playback problems for the old formats, though most \nstill play.\n\nIBM\n Machiness have little GUI code, data, and hooks present in hardware for \nprogrammers to work with, so most of the coding must be provided in the OS.  \nSince hard disks were slow the disk OS code is read into RAM.  In addition, \nwhat little ROM code there is also read into RAM {a process called Shadow ROM}  \nThis results in faster implementation since RAM is faster then PROMS or \nEPROMS.  Having most of the OS code on disk has the advantage of being able to \nbetter optimize the code given a certain piece or collection of hardware which \nis harder with a ROM based system due to the 'patches' needed.  In addition it \nreduces the need for and size of patches if a major revision of the hardware \nsupport is needed.\nSide note:  The FTC charged that MicroSoft formed a OS trust by not providing \nall feature documentation for its OSes to developers outside MS and designing \nits Windows and DOS apps to fail under OS/2 (\"Undocumented Windows\") and \n\"There is deliberate code in [Windows] NT Beta which causes the install to \nabort if OS/2 Boot Manager is present\" (Gregory Hicks, Info-IBMPC Digest V92 \n#201).  Due to a conflict of intrest by one member the vote of the FTC \njudicial council for action against Microsoft was a tie which resulted in no \naction.  Rumors-the FTC will presue the matter, likely to the point of \nchoosing a new member or whole new council.  In addition the government has \nturned down Microsoft's copyright of \"Windows\" which would allow it to charge \na fee for developers using their hooks (PC Week 03/08/93).\nMicroSoft OSes\nDOS 5.0: Has a 640K barrier with its own memory manager, a 1 MB barrier \n with third party memory managers.  This 16-bit OS requires that each program \n must provide its own print drivers and be 16-bit {Programs need to be DOS \n Protected Mode Interface (DPMI) compliant and running on a 386dx [32-bit \n Protected Mode] to break these barriers}.  Contains the GUI shell present in\n DOS 4.0.\nDOS 6.0: DOS 5.0 with the added features of a built-in file compresion, disk \n defragmenter, debugger for the CONFIG.SYS file. It needs a $80 module for \n networking {Cost: $50 through 5/93, after that $129.99} \n (Byte April 1993:44-46).\nDOS 7.0: 32-bit DOS. In development (PC Week 04/05/93).\nWindow 3.0: Runs on top of DOS.  Breaks 640K and 1M barriers but still has to \n deal with DOS file structure.  Base requirements: 1MB, floppy and 286; to\n run well 2MB, hard drive, 386sx and fast display adapter {> 8-bit}.  Has the\n equivalent of Mac's QD called Windows GDI [Graphics Device Interface].\n This does not have a consistent application interface {Like early Mac\n programs  (1984-1985)} nor a very large program base {compared to DOS} and\n still tends to slow the machine down (Info-IBMPC Digest V92 #186) with speed\n is more dependent on the display adapter then on the CPU (Bill Coleman).\n Window programs tend to be disk and memory hogs compared to their DOS\n counterparts (Byte April 1993:98-108).\nWindow 3.1: A faster version of Window 3.0 with better memory managment. Base \n requirements 1 MB, hard drive and a 286 ;to run well 2MB, hard drive, 386sx. \n Apple plans to release its print drivers for this (PC Week 12/28/92).\nWindows for Workgroups:  To run well: 4MB RAM and 386dx (PC World Feb/93:160).  \n Intermediary between Win 3.1 and Windows NT.  It is basically Windows 3.1 \n with built-in peer to peer networking support.\nWindows NT:  Beta release takes about 50MB of disk space [including the \n swap file], and 12MB RAM {Betas are notorious for RAM usage especially in \n the interaction between debuging code and program compliers, hence the \n reports of 24MB requirements}.  Released version supposed to need 8MB RAM \n but, Gates himself now recommends 16MB RAM (PC Week 04/15/92).\n This 32-bit OS has Protected mode multitasking, multithreading, symmetric \n multiprocessing, a recoverable file system, and 32-bit GDI.  Has built in\n networking that is OSF DCE compliant and can handle up to 4GB of RAM.  Even\n though some people see a July 4 release date (InfoWorld Nov 16/92), rumor\n is that the final version will not be available before Oct 1993\n (InfoWorld May 25/92; July 6/92; Vaporware 07/92; 08/92) or 4th quarter 1993\n (PC Week 09/28/92). Windows upgrades will be $295, otherwise $495\n (PC Week 04/15/92; 03/15/93).\nOther OSes\nPC-DOS 6.0: IBM's version of DOS 6.0.  It runs Windows much faster then DOS \n 6.0 due to faster file I/O and video handling (InfoWorld Feb 1, 93).\nDR DOS 6.0: same as DOS 5.0 with some extras {like built-in data compression} \n and memory management enhancements. Still has 640K/1MB barrier.  A later \n version {Novell DOS} of this may use a version of the Mac finder and Apple \n file management system (PC Week 12/14/92; InfoWorld Dec 14/92).\nOS/2 2.0: Unix like features and unix like requirements; 8-16MB RAM,\n 60MB {uses 17-33MB} hard drive, and 386dx CPU. This 32-bit multithreaded, \n multitasking OS can address up to 4GB of RAM but has to use a fast swap file \n to use more than 16 MB RAM on ISA systems using DMA {Direct Memory Access}. \n IBM plans to use Taligent's OOPS in future versions of this \n (InfoWorld Oct 26/92).\nAIX:  IBM's UNIX system, planned to be a subset of PowerOpen and Taligent OS.\nNeXTStep: GUI UNIX to provide NeXT features on IBM machines.  Beta out, final \n version to be out by May 25, 1993.\nSolaris OS for x86: a SunSoft port.  A 32-bit OS with symmetric \n multiprocessing and multithreading, built-in networking capabilities with \n tools to allow remote configuring and adminstration features, and \n communication package.

Developer kits-software: $495, hardware: $195.\nMac 7.1 [working name: Star Trek]:  Apple had System 7.0 running off Intel \n Chips and is looking at making a 7.1 version available for IBM \n (ComputerWorld Nov 2/92; MacWeek 03/22/93). At present this is planned to run \n on top of Novell's DR DOS, require a 486 or equivalent to run and that apps \n will need to be recompiled (MacWeek 03/22/93).  Viewed as Novell's answer to \n Windows NT.  The complexity of PC hardware set ups is one reason for slow \n progress {This seems to Apple/IBM's way of leading to the PowerPC line out in \n late 1993/early 1994 and Pink OS in late 1994-early 1995.}\n\nPowerPC\nRumor-IBM will build its PowerPC 601 by late 1993 (InfoWorld June 8 & 15, 92; \nMacWeek 7/13/92; PC Week 3/15/93).  It will have MicroChannel bus and XGA \nvideo (Carl B Jabido), and will run native version AIX and Mac apps (PC Week \n3/15/93); there have been no comments on compatablity of DOS or Windows apps.\nApple's PowerPC 601 machine {Tesseract} is planned to be out Jan 24, 1994 and \nto have MC98601/50 MHz, 4/8MB RAM, a 2.8-Mbyte floppy drive and expected to \nsale near LC line prices {~$2000, down from projections of ~$3000 (MacUser \n9/92:146)}\n(MacWeek 3/22/93).\nPowerOpen [A/UX 4.0]: A 32-bit preemtive multitasking OS planned to run on\n PowerPCs and 68030/40 Macs (MacWeek 7/13/92).  Intel compatibility uncertain\n (See Mac 7.1 above).  Planned base requirements:  68030, 8MB RAM, 80MB hard\n drive (MacWeek 4/19/93). Rumor-ahead of schedule; COULD be out by mid 1993.\n Rumor-this could be the OS for IBM's PowerPC 601 which is due by late 1993.\nPink [Taligent OS]: Expecting delivery in 1994 (Wall Street Journal 1/12/92) \n and may have some parts shipping in OS/2 and AIX in 1993 and Mac OS and \n PowerOpen with the PowerPCs (MacWeek 01/25/93).\nWindows NT: Possible port (MacWeek 04/05/93).  See IBM OS section for details.\nSolaris OS: Version of this Sun Microsystems Inc UNIX OS to run on the\n Power PCs in 1994 (MacWeek 04/05/93).  One of the few OSes to directly state \n that it will run Windows/DOS programs.  IBM OS section for details\nNeXTStep: possible port see IBM OS section for details.\n\nOS Number Crunching (Mel Park)\nMac\n Arithmetic is done in a consistent numerical environment {SANE or Standard \nApple Numerics Environment}. Floating point numbers are 96 bits long when an \nFPU is present and 80 bits otherwise. Exceptions, such as dividing by zero or \ntaking the square root of a negative number, do not cause an abort but are \nhandled in a logically consistent manner. 1/0 produces the internal \nrepresentation for infinity (INF).  1/(1/0) produces zero. The above treatment \nof 1/(1/0) occurs in an FPU-equipped machine even when SANE is bypassed and \nthe FPU programmed directly.\n\nIBM\n Floating point numbers are 80-bits with a hardware FPU, 64-bits when \nemulated.  The way they are handled is dependent on the coding of whatever \ncompiler or assembler was used for a program. On older DOS complilers \nexceptions could cause program aborts; 1/0 and 1/(1/0) would abort to the DOS \nprompt at the point where they occured.  Most present compilers handle this \nbetter.  Result: there is little consistent handling of numbers between DOS, \nWindows and OS/2 programs nor between programs for just one OS.\n\nNetworking [Includes printing]\nWYSIWYG printing can be a problem with either Mac of IBM machines especially \nif one sends TrueType fonts to a older style PostScript printer.\nMac\nHardware: Built-in LocalTalk network port and a built-in printer port.  \nLocalTalk has moderate speeds (230.4 Kb/s) requires special connectors for \neach machine ($15 and up) and can be run off of either the printer port {to \ninclude very old macs} or the network port {standard today}.  Built-in \nEthernet is becoming common but many older Macs require a PDS or Nubus card at \nabout $150-$300 for each machine.  These cards provide three connectors and \ntransceivers {thick, thin, and 10BaseT} for Ethernet.\nThe Macintosh Quadra family and some Centris models includes Ethernet \ninterface on motherboard, with transceivers available. TokenRing has been a \nnetwork option since 1989.\nSoftware: AppleTalk {the suite of protocols} standard with Mac OS, which can \nuse variety of media types.  AppleShare client software included with the OS \nas well and can connect to file servers such as Novell Netware, 3Com 3+Open, \nBanyan Vines, DEC Pathworks, Apple's AppleShare servers, System 7 File Sharing \nmachines, and AFP servers running on variety of UNIX hosts.  MacTCP allows \ntypical TCP/IP communications (telnet, ftp, NFS, rlogin).  A later version \nwill have Unix X/Open Transport Interface (XTI) built-in by the end of 1993 \n(MacWeek 04/12/93).  Third-party software to connect to NFS servers.  DEC \nPathworks provides DECnet support.  Peer-to-peer file sharing software \nbuilt-in to System 7.1 (See OS section).  Full server software is extra. \nPrinting requires connection of the printer and the printer being selected in \nthe chooser.  Changing printers is by selecting a different name in the \nchooser.  The same is true of connecting to servers.\nPrinting bugs:  Monaco TrueType font is different then the screen bitmap font.\n {QuickDraw QX is suppossed to fix this and similar problems.}\n\nIBM  \nHardware: LocalTalk [not widely used], Ethernet,  and TokenRing.\nSoftware: Novell Netware, Banyan Vines, DECNet, Windows/Work Groups, AppleTalk \nprotocols, and AppleShare {subset of AppleTalk}.\nEach of the MS-DOS networking schemes are, in general, totally incompatible \nwith the others. Once you have chosen one, you are pretty much locked-in to \nthat product line from then on.  Windows/Work Groups is a little more \nforgiving and removes some of this problem.  Novell Netware is the biggest, \n{~80 percent of the corporate market.} and in general is more powerful and \noffers better control/management/security than AppleShare, but it's also more \ncomplex to set up and manage.  This will change due to the use of the Mac \nfinder and file management system by Novell. (PC Week 12/14/92 & 12/28/92;  \nInfoWorld Dec 14/92; MacWeek 3/22/93)\nPrinting {Very OS dependent}\nDOS: If it's a single user, then you plug the printer into the parallel port, \n and don't worry about it {Tweeking may be needed with poorly written \n software}.  Network Printing is not controlled by the system, but is mostly \n implemented by the actual program, therefore performance varies from one \n software program to the next.\nWindows 3.x: supports standard drivers and can do a good job of showing \"jobs\" \n in the print queue, but it always lists printers as \"active\"... even if they \n are not.  This becomes a problem if there are several incompatible printers \n on the same net, because there's no way for software to reliably determine \n which printer is active right now.  Windows for Workgroups is more Mac-like \n and intelligent about this.\nOS/2: Mac-like; the os deals with printers, with apps making calls to the OS.\nPrinting bugs: due to poor programing some programs for all the above OSes do \nnot have WYSIWYG printing.

Which is why I only go\nby the Pentecost use where it's an actual language.\n\nMoreover, the phrase \"though I speak with the tongues of men and angels\"\nused by Paul in I Cor. is misleading out of context.   Some would then\nassume that there is some angelic tongue, and if when they speak, it\nis no KNOWN language, then it is an angelic tongue.\n\nHmmm...in the old testament story about the tower of Babel, we see how\nGod PUNISHED by giving us different language.

When you watch TV, they have commercials to pay\nfor the programming.  You accept that as part of watching.  If you don't like\nit, you can turn it off.  If you want to view the night sky, and there is a\nfloating billboard out there, you can't turn it off.

{"text":"Classify the following data: Posted by Cathy Smith for L. Neil Smith\n\n                   LETTER TO A LIBERAL COLLEAGUE\n\n[AUTHOR'S NOTE:  \"Adrian\" -- name changed to protect the guilty -- \nand the author are science fiction novelists who once worked with \nthe same editor at a famous New York publishing house.]\n\nDear Adrian:  \n\nI'm way behind schedule on my current book again, so this reply to \nyour note -- criticizing the recent magazine interview I gave and \ngenerally attacking gun ownership -- will necessarily consist \nmostly of assertions you're free to believe (or not) I can back \nwith evidence and logic I've neither time nor energy to present \nnow.  I've written fully on this topic before and will again in the \nfuture.  When I do, I'll make sure you get copies.  \n\nThere are many arguments I might make, from the futility and danger \nof delegating self-defense to the police (see Don Kates in the Jan. \n10, 1985 WALL STREET JOURNAL) to the real effect of prohibition, \nshifting consumers from newly-outlawed handguns or semiautomatic \nrifles to items like sawed-off shotguns or homemade bombs, but I'll \nlimit myself here to commenting on the newspaper clipping you sent \nwith your note.  \n\nFirst, the freedom to own and carry the weapon of your choice is a \nnatural, fundamental, and inalienable human, individual, civil, and \nConstitutional right -- subject neither to the democratic process \nnor to arguments grounded in social utility.  \n\nSecond, publication of some latter-day \"scientific study\" doesn't \nalter the fact that the gun prohibitionists I discussed in my \ninterview -- annoying you so much in the process -- were lying.  \n\nThird, the freedom to own and carry the weapon of your choice is a \nnatural, fundamental, and inalienable human, individual, civil, and \nConstitutional right -- subject neither to the democratic process \nnor to arguments grounded in social utility.  \n\nFourth, as often happens with these things, the \"study\" doesn't \nsupport the gun prohibitionists' original numerical contentions \nanyway, but simply adds a new layer of spurious claims to an older \nbody of lies, omissions, and distortions.  \n\nFifth, the freedom to own and carry the weapon of your choice is a \nnatural, fundamental, and inalienable human, individual, civil, and \nConstitutional right -- subject neither to the democratic process \nnor to arguments grounded in social utility.  \n\nSixth, the fact that gun prohibitionists have been caught lying on \ncountless occasions (Carl Bakal, author of NO RIGHT TO KEEP AND \nBEAR ARMS, even confessed to it publicly) makes the value of this \npresent \"study\" dubious, to say the least.  \n\nSeventh, the freedom to own and carry the weapon of your choice is \na natural, fundamental, and inalienable human, individual, civil, \nand Constitutional right -- subject neither to the democratic \nprocess nor to arguments grounded in social utility.  \n\nEighth, given your own lifelong service as a federal bureaucrat \n(not to mention the cynical sophistication of your fiction), you \nshould be better aware than most people how \"progress\" -- in \ndesigning \"studies\" to prove whatever you want -- outstrips our \nability to collect meaningful data.  A case in point we might agree \non is the fact that it took another kind of prohibitionist 20 or 30 \nyears to create \"studies\" \"proving\" that pornography causes crime.  \nMore naive (and probably more honest) efforts in the 50s and 60s \nclearly indicate the contrary.  \n\nNinth, the freedom to own and carry the weapon of your choice is a \nnatural, fundamental, and inalienable human, individual, civil, and \nConstitutional right -- subject neither to the democratic process \nnor to arguments grounded in social utility.  \n\nTenth, another reason to doubt all such \"studies\" is that human \nbehavior (as the Austrian School of economics demonstrates) is far\ntoo complex and unpredictable to be meaningfully quantified.  The \nattempt to do so -- and then create public policy based on the \nresulting pseudo-information -- is wrecking our civilization.  \n\nEleventh, the freedom to own and carry the weapon of your choice is \na natural, fundamental, and inalienable human, individual, civil, \nand Constitutional right -- subject neither to the democratic \nprocess nor to arguments grounded in social utility.  \n\nTwelfth, the \"study\" is also worthless because it incorporates \nfigures for suicide, which is not necessarily a tragedy but \nbasically another individual right, sometimes with ancillary social \nbenefits.  If anything, perhaps suicide INTERVENTION should be a \ncriminal offense.  \n\nThirteenth and finally, the National Rifle Association officials \nquoted in the article, whatever their shortcomings (and they are \nmany), are correct in this instance:  the \"study\" is meaningless \nbecause the freedom to own and carry the weapon of your choice is a \nnatural, fundamental, and inalienable human, individual, civil, and \nConstitutional right -- subject neither to the democratic process \nnor to arguments grounded in social utility.  \n\nAnd because of that, Adrian, even if the \"study\" were valid, it \nwouldn't deter me from a lifelong personal objective of seeing that \nanyone can own any weapon he or she prefers and carry it however, \nwhenever, and wherever he or she desires without asking anybody's \npermission. In this I'm ably assisted by gun prohibitionists \nthemselves, whose yawping invariably moves previously unarmed \npeople to go out and buy their first gun \"while they still can\".  \nBefore the '68 Gun Control Act, most of the \"shooting fraternity\" \nviewed handguns (incorrectly, as it turned out) as inaccurate, \nineffective toys.  There probably weren't six million of them in \nthe whole country.  Now, thanks to Kennedy, Metzenbaum, the Bradys, \nand their ilk -- AMERICA'S GREATEST SPORTING GOODS SALES TEAM -- we \nprobably manufacture at least that many every year.\n\nThe fascinating datum is that Handgun Control, et al. are perfectly \naware of this -- so I guess you'll have to ask them yourself what \ntheir real motives are.  \n\nLook:  gun-making isn't an arcane or difficult art (and by the way, \nit's easier to make a fully automatic weapon than a semiautomatic; \nthe fact that I can still obtain my own weapon of preference, the \nself-loading pistol, is the only thing which keeps me from pursuing \nthis further).  Even if it were difficult, there are already a \nquarter billion firearms in America, with an estimated \"half life\" \nof 1000 years -- possibly more for stainless steel.  Guns are gonna \nbe around a long time, Adrian, whether you like it or not.\n\nAs for me, to paraphrase Elmer Keith, regardless of what the law \nprovides or any court decides, I'm always going to be armed.  And I \nwill always work to see that others are, as well.  The bad news is \nthat there are thousands more -- perhaps even hundreds of thousands \n-- where I come from.  We can't be stopped by passing laws, we can \nonly be forced to arm ourselves and others secretly and -- given \nboth the practical and alleged differences between full automatics \nand semiautomatics -- perhaps more efficiently.  \n\nSo what's the point?  \n\nL.

Find another way.\n\nYou know, in many ways this might be just the kick we need to straighten\nthings out in this country.  Also, people would have a need to replace\nguns with something else, perhaps deadly sprays that would make Mace and OC\nseem like water.  They would be lighter and easier to conceal.\n\nGuns are really \"old\" in design and as long as we have tons of them, no one\nis motivated to design something better.  I'm sure we could come up with\nsome real nasty stuff if we tried and getting rid of these guns would get\nus moving on this track asap.  This is what we really want, right?  Stuff\nthat's smaller, lighter and far more deadly.","label":"talk.politics.guns"}
{"text":"Classify the following data: The ATF agent interviewed on \"Street Stories\" reported that the raid was\nill planned, and went ahead even when they (the BD's) knew the ATF was \ncoming. WHY?\n\nI believe this raid was ill planned because they only had 2 days to plan it,\nand it was continued when failure was obvious because it had a bit part\nin the much larger political agenda of President Clinton. I would even \nsuggest that the loss of 4 ATF agents is inconsequential in this the\ncontext of his political agenda. It MIGHT even be beneficial to his agenda, \nas it helps point up just how evil these assualt weapons are. Further proof\nmight be that the ATF denied their agents (Street Stories report) requests\nfor sufficient fire power. \n\nImportant dates: \nFeb 25th - NJ assembly votes to overturn assault weapon ban.\nFeb 28th - Compound in Waco attacked.\t   \n\nOn Feb. 25th the New Jersey assembly voted to overturn the assault weapon\nban in that state. It looked like it might be a tight vote, but the Senate\nin N.J. was going to vote to overturn the ban. It would not sit well to have\nan Eastern state overturn an assault weapon ban, given Clintons stated\nagenda on gun control. I suspect Clinton gave the order to get someone or some\ngroup with assualt weapons and have the press present (they were initially\nat the incident in Waco) to record the event for the TV audience. The agent \non \"Street Stories\" reported that a supervisor was urging them all to \"get \nready fast\", as \"they know we are coming\". I believe this attack continued, \neven tho the probablility of failure was high,  because it came from the top \ndown. After the N.J. assembly vote, the ATF had a limited amount of time to\ncome up with something, and the Wackos in Waco fit the bill nicely.","label":"talk.politics.guns"}

In addition, people often request information which has\nbeen posted time and time again.  In order to try and cut down on this, the\nalt.atheism groups have a series of five regular postings under the following\ntitles:\n\n   1.  Alt.Atheism FAQ: Overview for New Readers\n   2.  Alt.Atheism FAQ: Introduction to Atheism\n   3.  Alt.Atheism FAQ: Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)\n   4.  Alt.Atheism FAQ: Constructing a Logical Argument\n   5.  Alt.Atheism FAQ: Atheist Resources\n\nThis is article number 1.  Please read numbers 2 and 3 before posting.  The\nothers are entirely optional.\n\nIf you are new to Usenet, you may also find it helpful to read the newsgroup\nnews.announce.newusers.  The articles titled \"A Primer on How to Work With\nthe Usenet Community\", \"Answers to Frequently Asked Questions about Usenet\"\nand \"Hints on writing style for Usenet\" are particularly relevant.  Questions\nconcerning how news works are best asked in news.newusers.questions.\n\nIf you are unable to find any of the articles listed above, see the \"Finding\nStuff\" section below.\n\n\n                                   Credits\n\nThese files could not have been written without the assistance of the many\nreaders of alt.atheism and alt.atheism.moderated.  In particular, I'd like to\nthank the following people:\n\nkck+@cs.cmu.edu (Karl Kluge)\nperry@dsinc.com (Jim Perry)\nNETOPRWA@ncsuvm.cc.ncsu.edu (Wayne Aiken)\nchpetk@gdr.bath.ac.uk (Toby Kelsey)\njkp@cs.HUT.FI (Jyrki Kuoppala)\ngeoff.arnold@East.Sun.COM (Geoff Arnold)\ntorkel@sics.se (Torkel Franzen)\nkmldorf@utdallas.edu (George Kimeldorf)\nroe2@quads.uchicago.edu (Greg Roelofs)\narromdee@jyusenkyou.cs.jhu.edu (Ken Arromdee)\nmadhaus@netcom.com (Maddi Hausmann)\nJ5J@psuvm.psu.edu (John A.

Truly free.  You may copy them and distribute them\nto anyone you wish.  However, please send any changes or corrections to the\nauthor, and please do not re-post copies of the articles to alt.atheism; it\ndoes nobody any good to have multiple versions of the same document floating\naround the network.\n\n\n                                Finding Stuff\n\nAll of the FAQ files *should* be somewhere on your news system.  Here are\nsome suggestions on what to do if you can't find them:\n\n1. Check the newsgroup alt.atheism.  Look for subject lines starting with\n   \"Alt.Atheism FAQ:\".\n\n2. Check the newsgroup news.answers for the same subject lines.\n\n   If you don't find anything in steps 1 or 2, your news system isn't set up\n   correctly, and you may wish to tell your system administrator about the\n   problem.\n\n3. If you have anonymous FTP access, connect to rtfm.mit.edu [18.172.1.27].\n   Go to the directory /pub/usenet/alt.atheism, and you'll find the latest\n   versions of the FAQ files there.\n\n   FTP is a a way of copying files between networked computers.  If you\n   need help in using or getting started with FTP, send e-mail to\n   mail-server@rtfm.mit.edu with\n\n      send usenet/news.answers/ftp-list/faq\n\n   in the body.\n\n4. There are other sites which also carry news.answers postings.  The article\n   \"Introduction to the news.answers newsgroup\" carries a list of these\n   sites; the article is posted regularly to news.answers.\n\n5. If you don't have FTP, send mail to mail-server@rtfm.mit.edu\n   consisting of the following lines:\n\n      send usenet/news.answers/finding-sources\n      send usenet/alt.atheism/faq\n      send usenet/alt.atheism/introduction\n      send usenet/alt.atheism/logic\n      send usenet/alt.atheism/resources\n\n5. (Penultimate resort)  Send mail to mail-server@mantis.co.uk consisting of\n   the following lines:\n\n      send atheism/faq/faq.txt\n      send atheism/faq/logic.txt\n      send atheism/faq/intro.txt\n      send atheism/faq/resource.txt\n\n   and our poor overworked modems will try and send you a copy of the files.\n   There's other stuff, too; interesting commands to try are \"help\" and\n   \"send atheism/index\".\n\n6. (Last resort)  Mail mathew@mantis.co.uk, or post an article to the\n   newsgroup asking how you can get the FAQ files.  You should only do this\n   if you've tried the above methods and they've failed; it's not nice to\n   clutter the newsgroup or people's mailboxes with requests for files.\n   it's better than posting without reading the FAQ, though!  For instance,\n   people whose email addresses get mangled in transit and who don't have \n   FTP will probably need assistance obtaining the FAQ files.\n","label":"alt.atheism"}

This article attempts to provide a gentle introduction to\nlogic, in the hope of improving the general level of debate.\n\nLogic is the science of reasoning, proof, thinking, or inference [Concise\nOED].  Logic allows us to analyze a piece of reasoning and determine whether\nit is correct or not (valid or invalid).  Of course, one does not need to\nstudy logic in order to reason correctly; nevertheless, a little basic\nknowledge of logic is often helpful when constructing or analyzing an\nargument.\n\nNote that no claim is being made here about whether logic is universally\napplicable.  The matter is very much open for debate.  This document merely\nexplains how to use logic, given that you have already decided that logic is\nthe right tool for the job.\n\nPropositions (or statements) are the building blocks of a logical argument. A\nproposition is a statement which is either true or false; for example, \"It is\nraining\" or \"Today is Tuesday\".  Propositions may be either asserted (said to\nbe true) or denied (said to be false).  Note that this is a technical meaning\nof \"deny\", not the everyday meaning.\n\nThe proposition is the meaning of the statement, not the particular\narrangement of words used to express it.  So \"God exists\" and \"There exists a\nGod\" both express the same proposition.\n\nAn argument is, to quote the Monty Python sketch, \"a connected series of\nstatements to establish a definite proposition\".  An argument consists of\nthree stages.\n\nFirst of all, the propositions which are necessary for the argument to\ncontinue are stated.  These are called the premises of the argument.  They\nare the evidence or reasons for accepting the argument and its conclusions. \n\nPremises (or assertions) are often indicated by phrases such as \"because\",\n\"since\", \"obviously\" and so on.  (The phrase \"obviously\" is often viewed with\nsuspicion, as it can be used to intimidate others into accepting suspicious\npremises.  If something doesn't seem obvious to you, don't be afraid to\nquestion it.  You can always say \"Oh, yes, you're right, it is obvious\" when\nyou've heard the explanation.)\n\nNext, the premises are used to derive further propositions by a process known\nas inference.  In inference, one proposition is arrived at on the basis of\none or more other propositions already accepted.  There are various forms of\nvalid inference.\n\nThe propositions arrived at by inference may then be used in further\ninference.  Inference is often denoted by phrases such as \"implies that\" or\n\"therefore\".\n\nFinally, we arrive at the conclusion of the argument -- the proposition which\nis affirmed on the basis of the premises and inference.  Conclusions are often\nindicated by phrases such as \"therefore\", \"it follows that\", \"we conclude\"\nand so on.  The conclusion is often stated as the final stage of inference.\n\nFor example:\n\nEvery event has a cause (premise)\nThe universe has a beginning (premise)\nAll beginnings involve an event (premise)\nThis implies that the beginning of the universe involved an event (inference)\nTherefore the universe has a cause (inference and conclusion)\n\nNote that the conclusion of one argument might be a premise in another\nargument.  A proposition can only be called a premise or a conclusion with\nrespect to a particular argument; the terms do not make sense in isolation.\n\nSometimes an argument will not follow the order given above; for example,\nthe conclusions might be stated first and the premises stated \nafterwards in support of the conclusion.  This is perfectly valid, if \nsometimes a little confusing.\n\nRecognizing an argument is much harder than recognizing premises or\nconclusions.  Many people shower their writing with assertions without ever\nproducing anything which one might reasonably describe as an argument.  Some\nstatements look like arguments, but are not.  For example:\n\n\"If the Bible is accurate, Jesus must either have been insane, an evil liar,\n or the Son of God.\"\n\nThis is not an argument, it is a conditional statement.  It does not assert\nthe premises which are necessary to support what appears to be its \nconclusion.  (It also suffers from a number of other logical flaws, but we'll\ncome to those later.)\n\nAnother example:\n\n\"God created you; therefore do your duty to God.\"\n\nThe phrase \"do your duty to God\" is not a proposition, since it is neither\ntrue nor false.  Therefore it is not a conclusion, and the sentence is not an\nargument.\n\nFinally, causality is important.  Consider a statement of the form \"A because\nB\".  If we're interested in establishing A and B is offered as evidence, the\nstatement is an argument.  If we're trying to establish the truth of B, then\nit is not an argument, it is an explanation.\n\nFor example:\n\n\"There must be something wrong with the engine of my car, because it will not\n start.\" -- This is an argument.\n\n\"My car will not start because there is something wrong with the engine.\"\n -- This is an explanation.\n\nThere are two traditional types of argument, deductive and inductive.  A\ndeductive argument is one which provides conclusive proof of its conclusions\n-- that is, an argument where if the premises are true, the conclusion must\nalso be true.  A deductive argument is either valid or invalid.  A valid\nargument is defined as one where if the premises are true, then the\nconclusion is true.\n\nAn inductive argument is one where the premises provide some evidence for the\ntruth of the conclusion.  Inductive arguments are not valid or invalid;\nhowever, we can talk about whether they are better or worse than other\narguments, and about how probable their premises are.\n\nThere are forms of argument in ordinary language which are neither deductive\nnor inductive.  However, we will concentrate for the moment on deductive\narguments, as they are often viewed as the most rigorous and convincing.\n\nIt is important to note that the fact that a deductive argument is valid does\nnot imply that its conclusion holds.  This is because of the slightly \ncounter-intuitive nature of implication, which we must now consider more\ncarefully.\n\nObviously a valid argument can consist of true propositions.  However, an\nargument may be entirely valid even if it contains only false propositions. \nFor example:\n\n   All insects have wings (premise)\n   Woodlice are insects (premise)\n   Therefore woodlice have wings (conclusion)\n\nHere, the conclusion is not true because the argument's premises are false. \nIf the argument's premises were true, however, the conclusion would be true. \nThe argument is thus entirely valid.\n\nMore subtly, we can reach a true conclusion from one or more false premises,\nas in:\n\n   All fish live in the sea (premise)\n   Dolphins are fish (premise)\n   Therefore dolphins live in the sea (conclusion)\n\nHowever, the one thing we cannot do is reach a false conclusion through valid\ninference from true premises.  We can therefore draw up a \"truth table\" for\nimplication.\n\nThe symbol \"=>\" denotes implication; \"A\" is the premise, \"B\" the conclusion. \n\"T\" and \"F\" represent true and false respectively.\n\nPremise Conclusion Inference\n   A        B        A=>B\n----------------------------\n   F        F         T      If the premises are false and the inference\n   F        T         T      valid, the conclusion can be true or false.\n\n   T        F         F      If the premises are true and the conclusion\n                             false, the inference must be invalid.\n\n   T        T         T      If the premises are true and the inference valid,\n                             the conclusion must be true.\n\nA sound argument is a valid argument whose premises are true.  A sound \nargument therefore arrives at a true conclusion.  Be careful not to confuse\nvalid arguments with sound arguments.\n\nTo delve further into the structure of logical arguments would require\nlengthy discussion of linguistics and philosophy.  It is simpler and probably\nmore useful to summarize the major pitfalls to be avoided when constructing\nan argument.  These pitfalls are known as fallacies.\n\nIn everyday English the term \"fallacy\" is used to refer to mistaken beliefs\nas well as to the faulty reasoning that leads to those beliefs.  This is fair\nenough, but in logic the term is generally used to refer to a form of\ntechnically incorrect argument, especially if the argument appears valid or\nconvincing.\n\nSo for the purposes of this discussion, we define a fallacy as a logical\nargument which appears to be correct, but which can be seen to be incorrect\nwhen examined more closely.  By studying fallacies we aim to avoid being\nmisled by them.  The following list of fallacies is not intended to be\nexhaustive.\n\nARGUMENTUM AD BACULUM (APPEAL TO FORCE)\n\nThe Appeal to Force is committed when the arguer resorts to force or the\nthreat of force in order to try and push the acceptance of a conclusion.  It\nis often used by politicians, and can be summarized as \"might makes right\". \nThe force threatened need not be a direct threat from the arguer.\n\nFor example:\n\"... Thus there is ample proof of the truth of the Bible.  All those who\nrefuse to accept that truth will burn in Hell.\"\n\nARGUMENTUM AD HOMINEM\n\nArgumentum ad hominem is literally \"argument directed at the man\".\n\nThe Abusive variety of Argumentum ad Hominem occurs when, instead of trying\nto disprove the truth of an assertion, the arguer attacks the person or\npeople making the assertion.  This is invalid because the truth of an\nassertion does not depend upon the goodness of those asserting it.\n\nFor example:\n\"Atheism is an evil philosophy.  It is practised by Communists and murderers.\"\n\nSometimes in a court of law doubt is cast upon the testimony of a witness by \nshowing, for example, that he is a known perjurer.  This is a valid way of\nreducing the credibility of the testimony given by the witness, and not\nargumentum ad hominem; however, it does not demonstrate that the witness's\ntestimony is false.  To conclude otherwise is to fall victim of the\nArgumentum ad Ignorantiam (see elsewhere in this list).\n\nThe circumstantial form of Argumentum ad Hominem is committed when a person\nargues that his opponent ought to accept the truth of an assertion because of\nthe opponent's particular circumstances.\n\nFor example:\n\"It is perfectly acceptable to kill animals for food.  How can you argue\notherwise when you're quite happy to wear leather shoes?\"\n\nThis is an abusive charge of inconsistency, used as an excuse for dismissing\nthe opponent's argument.\n\nThis fallacy can also be used as a means of rejecting a conclusion.  For \nexample:\n\n\"Of course you would argue that positive discrimination is a bad thing. \nYou're white.\"\n\nThis particular form of Argumentum ad Hominem, when one alleges that one's\nadversary is rationalizing a conclusion formed from selfish interests, is\nalso known as \"poisoning the well\".\n\nARGUMENTUM AD IGNORANTIUM\n\nArgumentum ad ignorantium means \"argument from ignorance\".  This fallacy\noccurs whenever it is argued that something must be true simply because it\nhas not been proved false.  Or, equivalently, when it is argued that\nsomething must be false because it has not been proved true.  (Note that this\nis not the same as assuming that something is false until it has been proved\ntrue, a basic scientific principle.)\n\nExamples:\n\"Of course the Bible is true.  Nobody can prove otherwise.\"\n\n\"Of course telepathy and other psychic phenomena do not exist.  Nobody has\nshown any proof that they are real.\"\n\nNote that this fallacy does not apply in a court of law, where one is\ngenerally assumed innocent until proven guilty.\n\nAlso, in scientific investigation if it is known that an event would produce\ncertain evidence of its having occurred, the absence of such evidence can \nvalidly be used to infer that the event did not occur.  For example:\n\n\"A flood as described in the Bible would require an enormous volume of water\nto be present on the earth.  The earth does not have a tenth as much water,\neven if we count that which is frozen into ice at the poles.  Therefore no\nsuch flood occurred.\"\n\nIn science, we can validly assume from lack of evidence that something has\nnot occurred.  We cannot conclude with certainty that it has not occurred,\nhowever.\n\nARGUMENTUM AD MISERICORDIAM\n\nThis is the Appeal to Pity, also known as Special Pleading.  The fallacy is \ncommitted when the arguer appeals to pity for the sake of getting a \nconclusion accepted.  For example:\n\n\"I did not murder my mother and father with an axe.  Please don't find me\nguilty; I'm suffering enough through being an orphan.\"\n\nARGUMENTUM AD POPULUM\n\nThis is known as Appealing to the Gallery, or Appealing to the People.  To\ncommit this fallacy is to attempt to win acceptance of an assertion by\nappealing to a large group of people.  This form of fallacy is often\ncharacterized by emotive language.  For example:\n\n\"Pornography must be banned.  It is violence against women.\"\n\n\"The Bible must be true.  Millions of people know that it is.  Are you trying\nto tell them that they are all mistaken fools?\"\n\nARGUMENTUM AD NUMERAM\n\nThis fallacy is closely related to the argumentum ad populum.  It consists of\nasserting that the more people who support or believe a proposition, the more\nlikely it is that that proposition is correct.\n\nARGUMENTUM AD VERECUNDIAM\n\nThe Appeal to Authority uses the admiration of the famous to try and win\nsupport for an assertion.  For example:\n\n\"Isaac Newton was a genius and he believed in God.\"\n\nThis line of argument is not always completely bogus; for example, reference\nto an admitted authority in a particular field may be relevant to a\ndiscussion of that subject.  For example, we can distinguish quite clearly\nbetween:\n\n\"Stephen Hawking has concluded that black holes give off radiation\"\nand\n\"John Searle has concluded that it is impossible to build an intelligent\n computer\"\n\nHawking is a physicist, and so we can reasonably expect his opinions on black\nhole radiation to be informed.  Searle is a linguist, so it is questionable \nwhether he is well-qualified to speak on the subject of machine intelligence.\n\nTHE FALLACY OF ACCIDENT\n\nThe Fallacy of Accident is committed when a general rule is applied to a\nparticular case whose \"accidental\" circumstances mean that the rule is\ninapplicable.  It is the error made when one goes from the general to the\nspecific.  For example:\n\n\"Christians generally dislike atheists.  You are a Christian, so you must\ndislike atheists.\"\n\nThis fallacy is often committed by moralists and legalists who try to decide\nevery moral and legal question by mechanically applying general rules.\n\nCONVERSE ACCIDENT / HASTY GENERALIZATION\n\nThis fallacy is the reverse of the fallacy of accident.  It occurs when one\nforms a general rule by examining only a few specific cases which are not\nrepresentative of all possible cases.\n\nFor example:\n\"Jim Bakker was an insincere Christian.  Therefore all Christians are\ninsincere.\"\n\nSWEEPING GENERALIZATION / DICTO SIMPLICITER\n\nA sweeping generalization occurs when a general rule is applied to a\nparticular situation in which the features of that particular situation\nrender the rule inapplicable.  A sweeping generalization is the opposite of a\nhasty generalization.\n\nNON CAUSA PRO CAUSA / POST HOC ERGO PROPTER HOC\n\nThese are known as False Cause fallacies.\n\nThe fallacy of Non Causa Pro Causa occurs when one identifies something as the\ncause of an event but it has not actually been shown to be the cause.  For \nexample:\n\n\"I took an aspirin and prayed to God, and my headache disappeared.  So God\ncured me of the headache.\"\n\nThe fallacy of Post Hoc Ergo Propter Hoc occurs when something is assumed to\nbe the cause of an event merely because it happened before the event.  For \nexample:\n\n\"The Soviet Union collapsed after taking up atheism.  Therefore we must avoid\natheism for the same reasons.\"\n\nCUM HOC ERGO PROPTER HOC\n\nThis fallacy is similar to post hoc ergo propter hoc.  It asserts that\nbecause two events occur together, they must be causally related, and leaves\nno room for other factors that may be the cause(s) of the events.\n\nPETITIO PRINCIPII\n\nThis fallacy occurs when the premises are at least as questionable as the\nconclusion reached.\n\nCIRCULUS IN DEMONSTRANDO\n\nThis fallacy occurs when one assumes as a premise the conclusion which one\nwishes to reach.  Often, the proposition will be rephrased so that the\nfallacy appears to be a valid argument.  For example:\n\n\"Homosexuals must not be allowed to hold government office.  Hence any\ngovernment official who is revealed to be a homosexual will lose his job. \nTherefore homosexuals will do anything to hide their secret, and will be open\nto blackmail.  Therefore homosexuals cannot be allowed to hold government\noffice.\"\n\nNote that the argument is entirely circular; the premise is the same as the \nconclusion.  An argument like the above has actually been cited as the reason\nfor the British Secret Services' official ban on homosexual employees. \nAnother example is the classic:\n\n\"We know that God exists because the Bible tells us so.  And we know that the\nBible is true because it is the word of God.\"\n\nCOMPLEX QUESTION / FALLACY OF INTERROGATION\n\nThis is the Fallacy of Presupposition.  One example is the classic loaded \nquestion:\n\n\"Have you stopped beating your wife?\"\n\nThe question presupposes a definite answer to another question which has not\neven been asked.  This trick is often used by lawyers in cross-examination,\nwhen they ask questions like:\n\n\"Where did you hide the money you stole?\"\n\nSimilarly, politicians often ask loaded questions such as:\n\n\"How long will this EC interference in our affairs be allowed to continue?\"\nor\n\"Does the Chancellor plan two more years of ruinous privatization?\"\n\nIGNORATIO ELENCHI\n\nThe fallacy of Irrelevant Conclusion consists of claiming that an argument \nsupports a particular conclusion when it is actually logically nothing to do\nwith that conclusion.\n\nFor example, a Christian may begin by saying that he will argue that the\nteachings of Christianity are undoubtably true.  If he then argues at length\nthat Christianity is of great help to many people, no matter how well he\nargues he will not have shown that Christian teachings are true.\n\nSadly, such fallacious arguments are often successful because they arouse\nemotions which cause others to view the supposed conclusion in a more\nfavourable light.\n\nEQUIVOCATION\n\nEquivocation occurs when a key word is used with two or more different\nmeanings in the same argument.  For example:\n\n\"What could be more affordable than free software?  But to make sure that it\nremains free, that users can do what they like with it, we must place a\nlicense on it to make sure that will always be freely redistributable.\"\n\nAMPHIBOLY\n\nAmphiboly occurs when the premises used in an argument are ambiguous because\nof careless or ungrammatical phrasing.\n\nACCENT\n\nAccent is another form of fallacy through shifting meaning.  In this case,\nthe meaning is changed by altering which parts of a statement are\nemphasized.  For example, consider:\n\n\"We should not speak ILL of our friends\"\nand\n\"We should not speak ill of our FRIENDS\"\n\nFALLACIES OF COMPOSITION\n\nOne fallacy of composition is to conclude that a property shared by the parts\nof something must apply to the whole.  For example:\n\n\"The bicycle is made entirely of low mass components, and is therefore very \nlightweight.\"\n\nThe other fallacy of composition is to conclude that a property of a number\nof individual items is shared by a collection of those items.  For example:\n\n\"A car uses less petrol and causes less pollution than a bus.  Therefore cars\nare less environmentally damaging than buses.\"\n\nFALLACY OF DIVISION\n\nThe fallacy of division is the opposite of the fallacy of composition.  Like\nits opposite, it exists in two varieties.  The first is to assume that a\nproperty of some thing must apply to its parts.  For example:\n\n\"You are studying at a rich college.  Therefore you must be rich.\"\n\nThe other is to assume that a property of a collection of items is shared by\neach item.  For example:\n\n\"Ants can destroy a tree.  Therefore this ant can destroy a tree.\"\n\nTHE SLIPPERY SLOPE ARGUMENT\n\nThis argument states that should one event occur, so will other harmful\nevents.  There is no proof made that the harmful events are caused by the\nfirst event.\n\nFor example:\n\"If we legalize marijuana, then we would have to legalize crack and heroin\nand we'll have a nation full of drug-addicts on welfare.  Therefore we cannot\nlegalize marijuana.\"\n\n\"A IS BASED ON B\" FALLACIES / \"IS A TYPE OF\" FALLACIES\n\nThese fallacies occur when one attempts to argue that things are in some way\nsimilar without actually specifying in what way they are similar.\n\nExamples:\n\"Isn't history based upon faith?  If so, then isn't the Bible also a form of\nhistory?\"\n\n\"Islam is based on faith, Christianity is based on faith, so isn't Islam a\nform of Christianity?\"\n\n\"Cats are a form of animal based on carbon chemistry, dogs are a form of\nanimal based on carbon chemistry, so aren't dogs a form of cat?\"\n\nAFFIRMATION OF THE CONSEQUENT\n\nThis fallacy is an argument of the form \"A implies B, B is true, therefore A\nis true\".  To understand why it is a fallacy, examine the truth table for\nimplication given earlier.\n\nDENIAL OF THE ANTECEDENT\n\nThis fallacy is an argument of the form \"A implies B, A is false, therefore B\nis false\".  Again, the truth table for implication makes it clear why this is\na fallacy.\n\nNote that this fallacy is different from Non Causa Pro Causa; the latter has\nthe form \"A implies B, A is false, therefore B is false\", where A does NOT in\nfact imply B at all.  Here, the problem is not that the implication is\ninvalid; rather it is that the falseness of A does not allow us to deduce\nanything about B.\n\nCONVERTING A CONDITIONAL\n\nThis fallacy is an argument of the form \"If A then B, therefore if B then A\".\n\nARGUMENTUM AD ANTIQUITAM\n\nThis is the fallacy of asserting that something is right or good simply\nbecause it is old, or because \"that's the way it's always been.\"\n\nARGUMENTUM AD NOVITAM\n\nThis is the opposite of the argumentum ad antiquitam; it is the fallacy of\nasserting that something is more correct simply because it is new or newer\nthan something else.\n\nARGUMENTUM AD CRUMENAM\n\nThe fallacy of believing that money is a criterion of correctness; that those\nwith more money are more likely to be right.\n\nARGUMENTUM AD LAZARUM\n\nThe fallacy of assuming that because someone is poor he or she is sounder or\nmore virtuous than one who is wealthier.  This fallacy is the opposite of the\nargumentum ad crumenam.\n\nARGUMENTUM AD NAUSEAM\n\nThis is the incorrect belief that an assertion is more likely to be true the\nmore often it is heard.  An \"argumentum ad nauseum\" is one that employs\nconstant repetition in asserting something.\n\nBIFURCATION\n\nAlso referred to as the \"black and white\" fallacy, bifurcation occurs when\none presents a situation as having only two alternatives, where in fact other\nalternatives exist or can exist.\n\nPLURIUM INTERROGATIONUM / MANY QUESTIONS\n\nThis fallacy occurs when a questioner demands a simple answer to a complex\nquestion.\n\nNON SEQUITUR\n\nA non-sequitur is an argument where the conclusion is drawn from premises\nwhich are not logically connected with it.\n\nRED HERRING\n\nThis fallacy is committed when irrelevant material is introduced to the issue\nbeing discussed, so that everyone's attention is diverted away from the\npoints being made, towards a different conclusion.\n\nREIFICATION / HYPOSTATIZATION\n\nReification occurs when an abstract concept is treated as a concrete thing.\n\nSHIFTING THE BURDEN OF PROOF\n\nThe burden of proof is always on the person making an assertion or\nproposition.  Shifting the burden of proof, a special case of argumentum ad\nignorantium, is the fallacy of putting the burden of proof on the person who\ndenies or questions the assertion being made.  The source of the fallacy is\nthe assumption that something is true unless proven otherwise.\n\nSTRAW MAN\n\nThe straw man fallacy is to misrepresent someone else's position so that it\ncan be attacked more easily, then to knock down that misrepresented position,\nthen to conclude that the original position has been demolished.  It is a\nfallacy because it fails to deal with the actual arguments that have been\nmade.\n\nTHE EXTENDED ANALOGY\n\nThe fallacy of the Extended Analogy often occurs when some suggested general\nrule is being argued over.  The fallacy is to assume that mentioning two \ndifferent situations, in an argument about a general rule, constitutes a \nclaim that those situations are analogous to each other.\n\nThis fallacy is best explained using a real example from a debate about \nanti-cryptography legislation:\n\n\"I believe it is always wrong to oppose the law by breaking it.\"\n\n\"Such a position is odious: it implies that you would not have supported\n Martin Luther King.\"\n\n\"Are you saying that cryptography legislation is as important as the\n struggle for Black liberation?  How dare you!\"\n\nTU QUOQUE\n\nThis is the famous \"you too\" fallacy.  It occurs when an action is argued to\nbe acceptable because the other party has performed it.  For instance:\n\n\"You're just being randomly abusive.\"\n\"So?  You've been abusive too.\"","label":"alt.atheism"}

{"text":"Classify the following data: From: Center for Policy Research <cpr>\nSubject: Hebrew labor: racist connotations\n\n\nAVODA IVRIT - HEBREW LABOR\n---------------------------------\n\n\"Hebrew labor\" is a concept which has served the Zionist movement\nfor a long time.  It has a double-barreled message: 1) The new Jew\nmust learn to do physical labor, i.e. working the land; 2) The\nland in this country must pass into Jewish hands, i.e. to the same\nnew Jew who has \"learned\" to work it. Both aspects of the\ntwo-pronged concept of \"Hebrew labor\" have racist connotations. On\nthe one hand, the diaspora Jew's lack of training in physical\nlabor is a myth shared by Zionists and antisemites.  On the other\nhand, its meaning in practice has been the displacement of the\nArab farmer from the source of his livelihood.\n\nThe occupation and the cheap Palestinian labor which streamed from\nthe occupied territories to the factories, orchards, and\nhot-houses of Israel relegated the myth of \"Hebrew labor\" to the\nhistory books and nostalgic memories of the Zionist Movement. It\nhas blossomed forth anew, however, as the government's answer to\nproblems caused by the closure of the territories. Today too this\nconcept has two functions: 1) to give a progressive look to the\nclosing of the Palestinian population.  Or in the words of\nEnvironment Minister Yossi Sarid, \"I have no tears for those who\nget rich off of cheap labor\". 2) to furnish an answer to the\nunemployed Israeli who complains of being obliged to work for\nwages that are lower than the unemployment insurance he receives.","label":"talk.politics.mideast"}

Spence moved for a mistrial but was denied.\n\nThe day was marked by a caustic cross-examination of Deputy\nMarshal Larry Cooper by defense attorney Gerry Spence.  Although\nSpence has not explicitly stated so, one angle of his stategy\nmust involve destroying the credibility of agent Cooper.  Cooper is\nthe government's only eyewitness to the death of agent Degan.\nSpence attacked Cooper's credibility by pointing out discrepancies\nbetween Cooper's statements last September and those made in court.\nCooper conceded that, \"You have all these things compressed into\na few seconds...It's difficult to remember what went on first.\"\n\nCooper acknowledged that he carried a \"9mm Colt Commando submachine\ngun with a silenced barrel.\" [I thought a Colt Commando was a revolver!]\nCooper continued by stating that the federal agents had no specific\nplans to use the weapon when they started to kill Weaver's dog.\n\nWhen Spence asked how seven cartridges could be fired by Degan's\nM-16 rifle when Degan was apparently dead, Cooper could not say for\nsure that Degan did not return fire before going down.\n\nSpence continued by asking with how many agents (and to what extent)\nhad Cooper discussed last August's events, Cooper responded, \"If\nyou're implying that we got our story together, you're wrong,\ncounselor.\"  Spence continued to advance the defense's version of\nthe events: Namely, that a marshal had started the shooting by\nkilling the Weaver's dog.  Cooper disagreed.\n\nAssistant U.S. Attorney Ronald Howen repeatedly objected to Spence's\nvirulent cross-examination of agent Cooper, arguing that the questions\nwere repetitive and Spence was wasting time.  Howen also complained \nthat Spence was improperly using a cross-examination to advance the\ndefense's version of the events.  U.S. District Judge Edward Lodge\nsustained many of the objections; however, both lawyers persisted\nuntil Judge Lodge had the jury leave the room and proceded to\nadmonish both attorneys.  \"I'm not going to play games with either\ncounsel.  This has been a personality problem from day 1, so start\nacting like professionals.\"\n\nSpence told the judge that, \"When all the evidence is in, we'll see\nthat ... his [agent Larry Cooper] testimony is not credible, that\nhe was panicked and cannot remember the sequence of events.\" \nSpence continued, \"We're going to find...that there is a very unlikely\nsimilarity - almost as if it had come out of a cookie cutter - between\nthe testimony of Mr. Cooper and the other witnesses.\"\n\nSpence then moved for a mistrial on the grounds that Howen's repeated\nobjections would prevent a fair trial, \"We can't have a fair trial if the\njury believes I'm some sort of charlatan, if the jury believes I'm\nbending the rules or engaging in some delaying tactic or that I'm\nviolating court orders.\"\n\nJudge Lodge called the notion that his repeated sustainings of Howen's\nobjections had somehow prejudiced the jury was \"preposterous\" and\ndenied the motion for a mistrial.  Lodge did tell Howen to restrict\nhis comments when objecting.\n\nThe trial resumed with the prosecution calling FBI Special Agent Greg\nRampton.  The prosecution's purpose was simply to introduce five\nweapons found in the cabin as evidence: However, the defense seized\non the opportunity to further address Cooper's credibility.\n\nDefense attorney Ellison Matthews (Harris' other attorney) questioned\nRampton about the dog.  Rampton stated that there were no specific\nplans to kill the Weaver's dog without being detected.  Matthews then\nhad Rampton read  a Septtember 15, 1992 transcript in which Rampton\nhad said that Cooper had said that the purpose of the silenced weapon\nwas to kill the dog without being detected, if the dog chased them.\nRampton then acknowledged that he believed that Cooper had said that,\nbut he could not remember when.  He then stated that, \"I did not conduct\nthe primary interview with Deputy Cooper, but I have had conversations\nwith him since the interview was conducted.\"","label":"talk.politics.guns"}

{"text":"Classify the following data: \nThe third-party media adapters are usually cheaper (at least in Toronto) than\nApple's. I bought the adapters from Asante instead of Apple.\n\n\nThat's not true. Only the DECstation 5000/200 comes with a Thinwire\n(BNC, coaxial) Ethernet connector. The 5000/25, 5000/133 and 5000/240\nall have a single 15-pin AUI Ethernet connector only. I distinctly\nremembered this because when got the 5000/200 first and I thought all\nof them are going to be Thinwire. I eventually had to go back and ordered\nDESTAs (DEC's oversized version of an AUI-to-BNC adapter that MUST be used\nwith a transciever cable) for the rest of the stations.\n\nMy advise to the very original poster (Beverly?) is:\n\n(1) If all you want is to create a LAN with two workstations and won't add\n    machines to it EVER, go for Thinwire regardless of the media type. Going\n    for UTP (unshielded twisted pair) wiring requires a concentrator which\n    means extra money and I believe these units come with at least 6 ports.\n    As for Thicknet, it's a nightmare and cabling is expensive. Avoid it\n    unless you have no choice (e.g. the two machines are two floors parts).\n\n(2) On the Mac side, you will need:\n    - one Thinwire media adapter (from Apple or third-party).\n    - MacX (make sure you get version 1.2; 1.1.7 won't run on System 7.1).\n    - MacTCP (which comes with MacX; if you get MacX v1.2, you should be\n      getting MacTCP v1.1.1 with it. Don't use earlier versions on a Centris).\n    - you may or may not need a 25ohm terminator depending on the\n      Thinwire media adapter. So just ask the sales if the adapter is\n      self-terminated or not.\n    - configure MacTCP to use \"Ethernet\".\n\n(3) On the DECstation side, you will need:\n    - for a Model 200, you will only need a T-connector.\n    - for Models 25, 125, 133, 240, you will need an AUI-to-BNC adapter.\n      Get one that can be plugged in directly to the AUI port of the\n      DECstation.

If so, why don't we get some dialog going here?\n\nHere's a topic to get things started. My daughter's Christian school sends\nhome a weekly update on school related topics. This week they sent\nsomething *very* interesting. It was an article written by the leader of a\nnational (US) Christian school organization about a trip he recently made\nto Jerusalem. While there, he was introduced to one of the rabbis who is\nworking on a project to rebuild the Temple at Jerusalem. The article\nincluded photos of the many furnishings that have already been made in\npreparation for furnishing the rebuilt temple according to the\nspecifications given in the Bible. \n\nWhat was even more striking is the fact that the plans for the temple are\ncomplete and the group is only awaiting permission from the Israeli\ngovernment before beginning the building. The other startling fact is the\nvery recent archeological discovery that the original site of the temple is\nunoccupied and available for building. Previously it has been thought that\nthe original site was underneath what is now a mosque, making rebuilding\nimpossible without sparking a holy war. \n\nNow it appears that nothing stands in the way of rebuilding and resuming\nsacrifices, as the Scriptures indicate will happen in the last days.\nAlthough the Israeli government will give the permission to start, I think\nit is the hand of God holding the project until He is ready to let it\nhappen. Brothers and sisters, the time is at hand. Our redemption is\ndrawing near. Look up!","label":"soc.religion.christian"}

We regard the subsequent development of the doctrines \nregarding papal authority and jurisdiction to be a separation of\nthe Bishop of Rome from the Orthodox church.  Without going into\nthe merits of the Great Schism, at least the Orthodox agree that\na split occurred, and don't paly what appear to be semantic games\nlike \"He's the Pope, but we don't recognize that what he does\nis effective...\".  Words aside, it appears to be a de facto split.\n\n\nWe sould argue from now until the Second Coming about what the \"real\"\ntraditional teaching of the Church is.

Over the last few\nyears I have heard of one case after another of government running\ncompletely amok.  Unfortunately, most people are oblivious of the\ngovernment's crimes and still think of it as their protector.  So I\nintend to put together what I call the \"American Horror File\": a\ncompilation of cases where the American government has run roughshod\nover the rights of its citizens over the last few years, focusing\nespecially on deaths and injuries resulting from no-knock warrants,\nand financial ruin to innocents resulting from civil forfeiture laws,\nbut including any other cases for which I can find decent\ndocumentation.  I hope to make people blood-boiling, artery-bursting,\nred-hot enraged at their government.\n\nThe end result will probably be a book in electronic form (ASCII text\nand postscript files) detailing the government's crimes of recent\nyears.  This book will be distributed at cost, and I will encourage\npeople to post copies to BBS's, send copies on disk to friends, and\nprint out copies and give them to neighbors.\n\nThis is a call for your help.  Any information that you can send me on\nhow government is running amok will be greatly appreciated.  I would prefer\ninformation that is well-documented, with sources given, about specific\ninstances of governmental abuses.

Plotting packages\n=====================\n\nGnuplot 3.2\n-----------\n  It is one of the best 2- and 3-D plotting packages, with\n  online help.It's a command-line driven interactive function plotting utility\n  for UNIX, MSDOS, Amiga, Archimedes, and VMS platforms (at least!).\n  Freely distributed, it supports many terminals, plotters, and printers\n  and is easily extensible to include new devices.\n  It was posted to comp.sources.misc in version 3.0, plus 2 patches.\n  You can practically find it everywhere (use Archie to find a site near you!).\n  The comp.graphics.gnuplot newsgroup is devoted to discussion of Gnuplot.\n\nXvgr and Xmgr (ACE/gr)\n-----------------------\n  Xmgr is an XY-plotting tool for UNIX workstations using\n  X or OpenWindows. There is an XView version called xvgr for\n  Suns. Collectively, these 2 tools are known as ACE/gr.\n  Compiling xmgr requires the Motif toolkit version 1.1\n  and X11R4 - xmgr will not compile under X11R3/Motif 1.0x.\n\n  Check at ftp.ccalmr.ogi.edu [129.95.72.34} in\n  /CCALMR/pub/acegr/xmgr-2.09.tar.Z (Motif version)\n  /CCALMR/pub/acegr/xvgr-2.09.tar.Z (XView version)\n\n  Comments, suggestions, bug reports to Paul J Turner\n  <pturner@amb4.ese.ogi.edu> (if mail fails, try pturner@ese.ogi.edu).\n  Due to time constraints, replies will be few and far between.\n\nRobot\n-----\n  Release 0.45 : 2-D and limited 3-D. Based on XView 3, written\n  in C / Fortran (so you need a Fortran compiler or the f2c translator).\n  Mainly tested on Sun4, less on DECstations. Check at\n  ftp.astro.psu.edu (128.118.147.28),  pub/astrod.\n\nVG plotting library\n-------------------\n  This is a library of Fortran callable routines at sunspot.ceee.nist.gov\n  [129.6.64.151]\n\nXgobi\n-----\n  It's being developed at Bellcore, and its speciality are\n  multidimensional data sets analysis and exploration. You can call it\n  from the S language also, and it works as an X11 client using the Athena\n  widget set (or with an ASCII terminal). It's distributed free of charge\n  from STATLIB at CMU.\n  To get it via e-mail, send email to statlib@temper.stat.cmu.edu and\n  in the body area of the message, put the line\n\n  send xgobi from general\n\n  If you want to pick it via ftp, connect to lib.stat.cmu.edu.

Added\n+  some stuff for scientific graphs, i.e. log axes, free scalable axes,\n+  XY-lineplots and some more, and re-added plotter callbacks from V4, e.g.\n+  to request the current pointer position, or to cut off a rectangle from the\n+  plotting area for zooming-in.

Despite its small size and quickness,\n+  it has enough power to satisfy most users, including:\n+  standard x-y plots, semilog plots, log-log plots, contour plots, 3D plots,\n+  mesh plots, bar charts and pie charts.  Multiple graphs (of the same or\n+  different sizes) may be placed on a single page with multiple lines in each\n+  graph.  Different line styles, widths and colors are supported.  A virtually\n+  infinite number of distinct area fill patterns may be used.  There are\n+  almost 1000 characters in the extended character set.

Image analysis software - Image processing and display\n==========================================================\n\nPC and Mac-based tools (multi-platform software)\n======================\n\nIMDISP\n------\n  IMDISP Written at JPL and other NASA sites. Can do simple display,\n  enhancing, smoothing and so on. Works with the FITS and VICAR/PDS\n  data formats of NASA. Can read TIFF images, if you know their dimensions\n  [PC and Macs]\n\nLabVIEW 2\n---------\n  LabVIEW is used as a framework for image processing tools. It provides a\n  graphical programming environment using block diagram sketch is the\n  \"program\" with graphical elements representing the programming elements.\n  Hundreds of functions are already available and are connected using a\n  wiring tool to create the block diagram (program).  Functions that the\n  block diagrams represent include digital signal processing and\n  filtering, numerical analysis, statistics, etc.  The tool allows any\n  Virtual Instrument (VI, a software file that looks and acts like a real\n  laboratory instrument) to be used as a part of any other virtual\n  instrument.\n\n  National Instruments markets plug-in digital signal processing (DSP)\n  boards for Macintoshs and PC compatables that allow real-time\n  acquisition and analysis at a personal computer.  New software tools for\n  DSP are allowing engineers to harness the power of this technology. The\n  tools range from low-level debugging software to high-level block\n  diagram development software.  There are three levels of DSP programming\n  associated with the NB-DSP2300 board and LabVIEW:\n  Use of the NB-DSP2300 Analysis Library: FFTs, power spectra, filters\n  routines callable from THINK C and Macintosh Programers Workshop (MPW) C\n  that execute on the NB-DSP2300 board. There is an analysis Virtual\n  Interface Library of ready-to-use VIs optimized for the NB-DSP2300.\n\n  Use of the National Instruments Developers Toolkit that includes an\n  optimizing C compiler, an assembler and a linker for low-level\n  programming of the DSP hardware.  This approach offers the highest level\n  of performance but is the must difficult in terms of ease of use.\n\n  Use of the National Instruments Interface Kit software package which has\n  utility functions for memory management data communications and\n  downloading code to the NB-DSP2300 board. (This is the easiest route for\n  the development of custom code.)\n\nUltimage Concept VI\n-------------------\n  Concept VI  by Graftek-France is a family of image processing Virtual\n  Instruments (VIs) that give LabVIEW 2 (described above) users high-end\n  tools for designing, integrating and monitoring imaging control systems.\n  A VI is a software file that looks and acts like a real laboratory\n  instrument. Typical applications for Concept VI include thermography,\n  surveillance, machine vision, production testing, biomedical imaging,\n  electronic microscopy and remote sensing.\n\n  Ultimage Concept VI addresses applications which require further\n  qualitative and quantitative analysis.  It includes a complete set of\n  functions for image enhancement, histogram equalization, spatial and\n  frequency filtering, isolation of features, thresholding, mathematical\n  morphology analysis, density measurement, object counting, sizing and\n  characterization.\n\n  The program loads images with a minimum resolution of 64 by 64, a pixel\n  depth of 8, 16, or 32 bits, and one image plane.  Standard input and\n  output formats include PICT, TIFF, SATIE, and AIPD.  Other formats can\n  be imported.\n\n  Image enhancement features include lookup table transformations, spatial\n  linear and non-linear filters, frequency filtering, arithmetic and logic\n  operations, and geometric transformations, among others.  Morphological\n  transformations include erosion, dilation, opening, closing, hole\n  removal, object separation, and extraction of skeletons, among others.\n  Quantitative analysis provides for objects' detection, measurement, and\n  morphological distribution.  Measures include area, perimeter, center of\n  gravity, moment of inertia, orientation, length of relevant chords, and\n  shape factors and equivalence.  Measures are saved in ASCII format.  The\n  program also provides for macro scripting and integration of custom\n  modules.\n\n  A 3-D view command plots a perspective data graph where image intensity\n  is depicted as mountains or valleys in the plot.  The histogram tool can\n  be plotted with either a linear or logarithmic scale. The twenty-eight\n  arithmetic and logical operations provide for: masking and averaging\n  sections of images, noise removal, making comparisons, etc.  There are\n  13 spatial filters that alter pixel intensities based on local\n  intensity.  These include high-pass filters for contrast and outlines.\n  The frequency data resulting from FFT analysis can be displayed as\n  either the (real , imaginary ) components or the (phase, magnitude)\n  data.  The morphological transformations are useful for data sharpening\n  and defining objects or for removing artifacts.\n\n  The transformations include: thresholding, eroding, dilating and even\n  hole filling.\n\n  The program's quantitative analysis measurements include: area,\n  perimeter, center of mass, object counts, and angle between points.\n\n  GTFS, Inc. 2455 Bennett Valley Road #100C Santa Rosa, CA 95494\n  707-579-1733\n\nIPLab Spectrum\n--------------\n  IPLAB Spectrum supports image processing and analysis but lacks the\n  morphology and quantitative analysis features provided by\n  Graftek-FranceUs Ultimage Concept VI.  Using scripting tools, the user\n  tells the system the operations to be performed. The problem is that far\n  too many basic operations require manual intervention. The tool\n  supports: FFTs, 16 arithmetic operations for pixel alteration, and a\n  movie command for cycling through windows.\n\n\nMacintosh-based tools\n=====================\n\nNCSA Image, NCSA PalEdit and more\n---------------------------------\n  NCSA provides a whole suite of public-domain visualization tools for the\n  Macintosh, primarily aimed at researchers wanting to visualize results\n  from numerical modelling calculations.  These applications,\n  documentation, and source code are available for anonymous ftp from\n  ftp.ncsa.uiuc.edu.

Using a frame grabber card, it can record sequences of\n  images to be played back as a movie. It can invoke user-defined\n  convolution matrix filters, such as Gaussian. It can import raw\n  data in tab-delimited ASCII, or as 1 or 2-byte quantities. It also\n  does histograms and even 3-D plots. It is limited to 8-bits/pixel,\n  though the 8 bits map into a color lookup table. It runs on any Mac\n  that has a 256-color screen and a FPU (or get the NonFPU version\n  from zippy.nimh.nih.gov)\n\nPhotoMac\n--------\n  Data Translation, Inc. 100 Locke Dr. Marlboro, MA 01752 508-481-3700\n\nPhotoPress\n----------\n  Blue Solutions 3039 Marigold Place Thousand Oaks, CA 91360 805-492-9973\n\nPixelTools and TCL-Image\n------------------------\n  \"Complete family of PixelTools (hardware accelerator and applications\n  software) for scientific image processing and analysis.

Once an image has been imported it can be Rre-touchedS with\n  various editing tools typical of those used in Macintosh-based RpaintS\n  applications.  These include an eraser, pencil, brush and air brush.\n  Advanced RpasteS tools that control the interaction between a pasted\n  selection and the receiving site have also been incorporated.  For\n  example, all red pixels in a selection can easily be preventing from\n  being pasted. Photoshop has transparencies ranging from 0 to 100%,\n  allowing you to create ghost overlays.  RPhoto-editingS tools include\n  control of the brightness and contrast, color balancing, hue/saturation\n  modification and spectrum equalization.  Images can be subjected to\n  various signal processing algorithms to smooth or sharpen the image,\n  blur edges, or locate edges.  Image scaling is also supported.\n\n  For storage savings, the images can be compressed using standard\n  algorithms, including externally supplied compression such as JPEG,\n  availlable from Storm Technologies. The latest version of Adobe\n  Photoshop supports the import of numerous image formats including: EPSF,\n  EPSF, TIFF, PICT resource, Amiga IFF/ILBM, CompuServe GIF, MacPaint,\n  PIXAR, PixelPaint, Scitex CT, TGA and ThunderScan..\n\n  Adobe Systems, Inc. 1585 Charlestown Road PO Box 7900 Mountain View, CA\n  94039-7900 415-961-4400\n\nColorStudio and ImageStudio\n---------------------------\n  ColorStudio is an image-editing and paint package from Letraset that has\n  more features than Adobe Photoshop but is decidedly more complex and\n  therefore more difficult to use.  Several steps are often required to\n  accomplish that which can be done in a single step using Photoshop.  The\n  application requires a great deal of available disk space as one can\n  easily end up with images in the 30 MB range.  The program provides a\n  variety of powerful selection tools including the \"auto selection tool\"\n  which lets the user choose image areas on the basis of color, close\n  hues, color range and mask.\n\nImageStudio: Don't know...\n\n  Letraset USA 40 Eisenhower Drive Paramus, NJ 07653 201-845-6100\n\nDapple Systems\n--------------\n  \"High resolution image analysis software provides processing tools to\n  work with multiple images, enhance and edit, and measure a variety of\n  global or feature parameters, and interpret the data.\"\n\n  Dapple Systems, 355 W. Olive Ave, #100 Sunnyvale, CA 94086 408-733-3283\n\nDigital Darkroom\n----------------\n  The latest release of Digital Darkroom has five new selection and\n  editing tools for enhancing images. One such feature allows the user to\n  select part of an image simply by \"painting\" it. A new polyline\n  selection tool creates a selection tool for single pixel wide\n  selections.  A brush lets the operator \"paint\" with a selected portion\n  of the image. Note that this is not a true color image enhancement tool.\n  This tool should be used when the user intends to operate in grey-scale\n  images only.  It should be noted that Digital Darkroom is not as\n  powerful as either Adobe Photoshop or ColorStudio.\n\n  Silicon Beach Software 9770 Carroll Ctr.

The tool has over 80 mathematical filter\n  variations: \"Laplacian, medium noise filter\", etc.  Files can be saved\n  as either TIFF, PICT, EPSF or text (however EPSF files can't be imported).\n\n  MicroFrontier 7650 Hickman Road Des Moines, IA  50322 515-270-8109\n\nImage Analyst\n-------------\n  An image processing product for users who need to extract quantitative\n  data from video images.  Image Analyst lets users configure\n  sophisticated image processing and measurement routines without the\n  necessity of knowing a programming language.  It is designed for such\n  tasks at computing number and size of cells in images projected by video\n  cameras attached to microscopes, or enhancing and measuring distances in\n  radiographs.\n\n  Image Analyst provides users with an array of field-proven video\n  analysis techniques that enable them to easily assemble a sequence of\n  instructions to enhance feature appearance; count objects; determine\n  density, shape, size, position, or movement; perform object feature\n  extraction; and conduct textural analysis automatically.  Image Analyst\n  works with either a framegrabber board and any standard video camera, or\n  a disk-stored image.\n\n  Within minutes, without the need for programming, the Image Analyst user\n  can set up a process to identify and analyze any element of a image.\n  Measurements and statistics can be automatically or semi-automatically\n  generated from TIFF or PICT files or from captured video tape images.\n  Image Analyst recognizes items in images based on their size, shape and\n  position.  The tool provides direct support for the Data Translation and\n  Scion frame grabbers. A menu command allows for image capture from a VCR\n  video camera or other NTSC or PAL devices.\n\n  There are 2 types of files, the image itself and the related Sequence\n  file that holds the processing, measurements and analysis that the user\n  defines.  Automated sequences are set up in Regions Of Interest (ROI)\n  represented by movable, sizable boxes atop the image.  Inside a ROI, the\n  program can find the distance between two edges, the area of a shape,\n  the thickness of a wall, etc.  Image Analyst finds the center, edge and\n  other positions automatically. The application also provides tools so\n  that the user can work interactively to find the edge of object. It also\n  supports histograms and a color look-up table (CLUT) tool.\n\n  Automatix, Inc. 775 Middlesex Turnpike Billerica, MA 01821 508-667-7900\n\nIPLab\n-----\n  Signal Analytics Corp. 374 Maple Ave. E Vienna, VA  22180 703-281-3277\n  FAX 703-281-2509\n\n  \"Menu-driven image processing software that supports 24-bit color or\n  pseudocolor/grayscale image display and manipulation.\"\n\nMAP II\n------\n  Among the Mac GIS systems, MAP II distributed by John Wiley has\n  integrated image analysis.\n\nIMAGE\n-----\n  from Stanford : Try anonymous ftp from sumex-aim.stanford.edu\n  It has pd source for image v2, and ready to run code for a mac under\n  image v3.\n\n\n\nWindows/DOS PC-based tools\n==========================\n\nCCD\n---\n  Richard Berry's CCD imaging book for Willamon-Bell contains (optional?)\n  disks with image manipulating software.

Documentation (PostScript mostly)\n  available via anonymous ftp to baboon.cv.nrao.edu (192.33.115.103),\n  directory pub/aips and pub/aips/TEXT/PUBL.  Installation requires building\n  the system and thus a Fortran and C compiler.\n     This package can read and write FITS data (see sci.astro.fits), and is\n  primarily for reduction, analysis, and image enhancement of Radio Astronomy\n  data from radio telescopes, particularly the Very Large Array (VLA), a\n  synthesis instrument.  It consists of almost 300 programs that do everything\n  from copying data to sophisticated deconvolution, e.g. via maximum entropy.\n  There is an X11-based Image tool (XAS) and a tek-compatible xterm-based\n  graphics tool built into AIPS.

All functions can be easily accessed via the\n  DISIMP executive. This menu is modular in design and groups image\n  processes by their function. Such a logical structure means that\n  complicated processes are simply a progression through a series of\n  modules.\n\n  Processes include image rectification, classification (unsupervised and\n  supervised), intensity transformations, three dimensional display and\n  Principal Component Analysis. DISIMP also supports the more simple and\n  effective enhancement techniques of filtering, band subtraction and\n  ratioing.\n\n  Host Configuration Requirements\n\n  Running on UNIX workstations, DISIMP is capable of processing the more\n  computational intensive techniques in interactive processing times.\n  DISIMP is available in both Runtime and Programmer's environments. Using\n  the Programmers environment, utilities can be developed for specific\n  applications programs.\n\n  Graphics are governed by an icon-based Display Panel which allows quick\n  enhancments of a displayed image. Manipulations of Look Up Tables,\n  colour stretches, changes to histograms, zooming and panning can be\n  interactively driven through this control.\n\n  A range of geographic projections enables DISIMP to integrate data of\n  image, graphic and textual types. Images can be rectified by a number of\n  coordinate systems, providing the true geographic knowledge essential\n  for ground truthing. Overlays of grids, text and vector data can be\n  added to further enhance referenced imagery.\n\n  The system is a flexible package allowing users of various skill levels\n  to determine their own working environment, including the amount of help\n  required. DISIMP comes fully configured with no optional extras. The\n  purchase price includes all functionality required for professional\n  processing of remote sensed data.\n\n  For further information, please contact:\n\n  The Business Manager, CLOUGH Engineering Group Systems Division, 627\n  Chapel Street, South Yarra, Australia 3141.

It is called HIPS, and deals with sequences of\n  multiband images in the same way it deals with single images.  It has\n  been growing since we first wrote it, both by additions from us as well\n  as a huge user-contributed library.\n\n  Feature description\n\n  HIPS  is  a  set  of  image  processing  modules  which together provide\n  a  powerful  suite  of  tools  for  those interested in research,\n  system  development  and  teaching. It  handles  sequences  of  images\n  (movies)  in precisely the same manner as single frames.\n\n  Programs and subroutines have been developed  for simple image\n  transformations, filtering, convolution, Fourier and other transform\n  processing, edge detection  and line  drawing   manipulation, digital\n  image compression and transmission  methods, noise generation, and image\n  statistics computation. Over 150 such  image transformation programs\n  have been developed.  As a result, almost any image processing  task\n  can be performed quickly and conveniently. Additionally, HIPS allows\n  users to easily integrate  their  own custom  routines.   New users\n  become effective using HIPS on their first day.\n\n  HIPS features images that are  self-documenting.   Each image stored  in\n  the  system  contains  a  history  of the transformations that have been\n  applied to that image.   HIPS includes  a  small  set of subroutines\n  which primarily deals with a standardized  image sequence  header,  and\n  a  large library  of  image  transformation tools in the form of UNIX\n  ``filters''.  It comes complete with source  code,  on-line manual\n  pages, and on-line documentation.\n\n  Host Configuration Requirements\n\n  Originally  developed at  New  York  University,  HIPS  now represents\n  one of the most extensive and flexible vision and image  processing\n  environments currently available.  It runs under the UNIX operating\n  system.  It is modular  and  flexible, provides automatic documentation\n  of its actions, and is almost entirely independent of special equipment.\n  HIPS is now in use on a variety of computers including Vax and\n  Microvax, Sun, Apollo,  Masscomp,  NCR Tower, Iris, IBM AT, etc.\n  For image display and input, drivers are supplied for the Grinnell and\n  Adage (Ikonas) image processors, and the Sun-2, Sun-3, Sun- 4, and\n  Sun-386i consoles.  We also  supply  user-contributed drivers  for  a\n  number of  other framestores and windowing packages (Sun gfx, Sun\n  console, Matrox VIP-1024, ITI IP-512, Lexidata,  Macintosh II, X\n  windowing system, and Iris).  The Hipsaddon package includes an\n  interface  for the  CRS-4000. It  is  a  simple matter to interface HIPS\n  with other frame- stores, and we can put interested users in touch with\n  users who  have interfaced HIPS with the Arlunya and Datacube Max-\n  Video. HIPS can be easily adapted for other  image  display devices\n  because 98% of HIPS is machine independent.\n\n  Availability\n\n  HIPS has proven itself a highly flexible  system,  both as  an\n  interactive  research tool, and for more production- oriented tasks. It\n  is both easy to use, and quickly adapted and extended to new uses. HIPS\n  is supplied on magnetic tape in UNIX tar format (either reel- to-reel or\n  Sun  cartridge), and comes with source code, libraries, a library of\n  convolu- tion masks, and on-line documentation and manual pages.\n\n  Michael Landy SharpImage Software P.O.

These are altogether different beasts! - nfotis ]\n\n  MIRA stands for Microcomputer Image Reduction and Analysis.  MIRA gives\n  workstation level performance on 386/486 DOS computers using SVGA cards in\n  256 color modes up to 1024x768. MIRA contains a very handsome/functional\n  GUI which is mouse and keystroke operated. MIRA reads/writes TIFF and FITS\n  formats, native formats of a number of CCD cameras, and uncompressed binary\n  images in byte, short integer, and 4-byte real pixel format in 1- or 2-\n  dimensions. The result of an image processing operation can be short integer\n  or real pixels, or the same as that of the input image. MIRA does the\n  operation using short or floating point arithmetic to maintain the precision\n  and accuracy of the pixel format. Over 100 functions are hand-coded in\n  assembly language for maximum speed on the Intel hardware.  The entire\n  graphical interface is also written in assembly language to maximize\n  the speed of windowing operations.  Windows for 2-d image and 1-d image/data\n  display and analysis have dedicated cursors which read position and value\n  value in real time as you move the mouse.  There are also smooth, real time\n  contrast and brightness stretch and panning of a magnified portion of\n  the displayed image(s), all operated by the mouse. A wide selection of\n  grayscale, pseudocolor, and random palettes is provided, and other \n  palettes can be generated.\n\n\nSupported functions include such niceties as the following:\n\no  image & image: + - / * interpolation\no  image & constant: + - / *\no  unary operations: abs value, polynomial of pixel value, chs, 1/x, log,\n   byteswap, clip values at upper/lower limits, short->real or real->short.\no  combine images by mean, median, mode, or sum of pixel values, with or\n   without autoscaling to mean, median, or mode of an image section.\no  convolutions/filters: Laplacian, Sobel edge operator, directional gradient,\n   line, Gaussian, elliptical and rectangular equal weight filters, unsharp\n   masking, median filters, user defined filter kernel.

{"text":"Classify the following data: \n       Horrors, appealing to popular principles.  Can we perhaps as the\nquestion of whether the Constitution might have been written to appeal\nto the principles, rather than, as you appear to believe, it was written\nwith something else in mind and \"propoganda\" put out by its supporters.\n\n       But let's be honest about something, here.  When was the last time\nyou brought up all the valid points against your own arguments?\n\n       Or are they simply propogranda?  We can't know what Phill *really*\nmeans because he's obviously using arguments designed to convince.\n\n\n       If they're true or false, regardles of why they were said, why\non earth did you make a point of calling them \"propogranda?\"  That\nwould seem to be irrelevent.\n\n\n       Oh, I have no argument with questioning them.  I don't believe\nthey no longer apply, but that's because I think most of them were\ngood arguments.  I'm not entirely happy about the situation, because\nthey were obviously only applied to a minority of the time, but I don't\nthink that alone is sufficient to invalidate them.\n\n\n       Since the U.S. constitution is the basis for the U.S. political\nsystem, most changes in it would require Constitutional change.  In this\nparticular case, however the fillibuster is a matter of procedure\nand tradition.  It only *should* have been made part of the Constitution. :-)\n\n\n        In principle no?  That they had less power of that they should have\nhad less power?\n\n\n        Phill, we're discusing the power of legislative houses.  While\nthe Prime Minister *is* member of Parliament, he is more analgous (although\nbadly) to the U.S. President.\n\n        Now, please explain to me how the U.S. House of Representatives\nis \"in principle\" more powerful than the House of Lords (or the Senate)\nbut in practice is less.  Are you suggesting that the writers of the\nConstitution *really* intended for them to be more powerful, but gosh\ndarn the thing was ratified before they realized they'd forgotten to put\nthose extra restrictions on the Senate in?\n\n\n      Not at all.  As any entry level political science course will tell\nyou, people who want laws implemented will always choose the level of\ngovernment to \"attack\" which presents them with the best chance of\ngetting what they want.  With national \"interest groups\" it is simply\na very rational thing to do to want the Federal government to enact a\nlaw rather than the states.  Less people to persuade, and less \n\"contributions\" to make.  \n\n      Why do those concerned about abortion primarily concentrate at\nthe Federal level?  Simply because if they win that battle all the little\nstate battlefields are won by extension.  The same extends to insurance,\nmedicine, and most other questions.\n\n      Local government has not \"failed\" in that it hasn't done what it\nshould, but that it is dominated by local interests.  Thus non-local\ninterests who want localities to abide by their rules can't get their\nrules past the local government.  Thus, since they've got more clout,\nonly in the wrong place, they appeal to the next higher level because\nit can impose its will on the lower.\n\n      I mean, let's get real here.  Do we *really* need the Congres\nof the United States deciding that x traffice light should be on thus-\nand such pattern?  Or that *carjacking* needs to be a federal as opposed\nto a local crime?\n\n      The more people want the more Congress will take power to \"sell\"\nit to them for their votes.  I don't think the rise of \"special interests\"\nis coincidence with the increased power of Congress.\n\n\n       Bingo.  The higher up the governmental ladder the less actual\nneed matters, because political power can be concentrated at higher\nlevels, while people with less cloud only find themselves reduced to\nin effectiveness.\n\n\n       Then why not simply leave New York's education to New York?  I\nremain unconcinved that there is any state in the Union which is not capable\nof educating its own children if that's what they want to do.  And if\nyou leave it to them, you only have to worry about the \"pork\" in that\nstate.  And since industries can't concentrate their political power\nand wealth, rather they must divide it among the states to try and get\nwhat they want, individual voices have more relative impact.\n\n       The problem with the fillibuster is not that you must \"buy off\"\nstates, but that the Congress has acquired too much power to sell pork.\n\n\n       But why on earth should we want to redirect it?  You said yourself \nthat you have to sell pork to get things through Congress.  If Congres\nhas less authority to sell pork and retains its authority to enact\nnational legislation within its granted jurisdiction, the pork problem\nis significantly reduced.\n\n\n       The current blocks essentially state that inaction is preferable\nto action, thus it the system is weighted against action.  Considering\nthe government the usually the institution with the sole power to\nenforce its decisions by force, I consider bias against making those\ndecisions a good thing.\n\n\n       The difference with the lower pyramid is that a) they have\nmore legal, legitimate authority in most matters under our Constitution\nthan the federal government, and b) at those lower levels power is\nharder to concentrate.  And c) you get the benefit of not imposing\nnew deicisons on everybody at once.  You get to see them tried out\nwithout a national decision.  Congressional action usually treats the\nentire country as a whole, yet even with similar problems in different\nareas, different solutions may be called for.\n\n       And while I often don't agree with the decisions my local\nand state reps make, at least I have a better option of going to\nthe city council and shooting my mouth off.  I'd much rather the\nmajority of laws be made by accessible people who hang around and end\nup having to put up with them rather than somebody far off in\nWashington with half a million or more constituents.\n\n       I'm curious what you base your assumption that lower levels\nare more corrupt.  \n\n\n       Phill, *you* brought up the Federalist papers.  We were\narguing the fillibuster and whether or not a minority of Senators\nshould be allowed to hold up a bill.  You claimed the Senate was\nsuppose to be a far less powerful House, and I contended there was\nnothing in the Constitution or other writings which indicated this.\nWhich was when you brought up that we can't decide what the founders\nwanted based on the Federalist papers.  You argued against them,\nI never argued from them.  I have primarily referred to the Constitution,\nwhich places only very small restrictions on the Senate than for\nthe House.\n\n\n       The U.S. Constitution is a nuts-and-bolts document.  The Delcaration\nof Independence was the high-brow reasoning.  (There are a couple of other\nexamples, though, such as the reasoning for the power to tax, and the\nreasoning for the power to grant permits, both in Article I, Section 8.)\n\n\n       To a certain extend I do believe the veto has become something\nit wasn't intended.  However, I also believe it is inevitable considering\nthe Congress' own abuse of their power to make bills say whatever they\nwant them to say.  Unlike most people I think we shouldn't be worrying\nabout the veto, which is fine, but of the problem in Congress which\nalmost necessitates its abuse.\n\n\n       *BUSH?*  Phill, that's absurd.  Bush had *37* vetos, one of\nwhich was over-ridden.  Go read up on FDR if you think that's\nanything resembling a record.\n\n\n       Why not?  What is inherently wrong with biasing the system\nagainst action?  Historically governemnt action in the U.S. when\ndealing with issues with a bare minority and a large minority have\nnot been successful.  When you're in a position of imposing federal\npower on diverse people, why should the federal government not have to\ngot through something more than a bare majority\n\n\n       Now we're switching from a general question of a fillibuster\nto a specific bill.  I don't see how it make a difference.\n\n\n       Sure it's arguable.  Theyr'e *arguing* it.  However, requiring\n60% to bring it to a vote ensures that they'll have to have a *good*\nargument.  Something that isn't based solely on party lines.\n\n\n       No, I am completely happy with a system which requires a minority\nfor *action*.  Since U.S. history is a history of carving up population\ngroups and implementing piece-meal on minorities, I feel minorities\nshould have sufficent clout to prevent action they feel strongly enough\nabout.  And 41% is hardly a tiny minority.  I don't advocate the minority\nbeing capable of initiating actionm but I see no problem with biasing\nthe *federal* system against action.\n","label":"talk.politics.misc"}

And key size is one of the things that can be\nverified externally.  Feed lots of random key/input pairs into the\nchip, then try flipping random key bits, and see what happens to the\noutput.  We already know what *should* happen -- about half the output\nbits should vary, on average, from a 1-bit key change or input change.\n\nIf they were out to build a weak cryptosystem, it might be the case that\nsome of the bits are much less powerful than others, in the sense that\nthey only enter into the encryption very late in the game.  By contrast,\nDES was designed to use each key bit as early as possible; the 50% output\nchange rate appears as early as round 5.  Again, though, I don't think\nNSA is going to cheat that crudely; they're likely to get caught.\n\nRemember that they've promised to let a committee of outside experts see\nthe cryptosystem design.  If you assume something DES-like, a biased\nsubkey generation schedule will stick out like a sore thumb.  The committee\ncan and should run lots of tests, and retain the output.

{"text":"Classify the following data: {Sorry, Harel et al, but our doctors and most hospitals are still\nprivate in Canada as well as in much of Western Europe.}\n\n\nWrong.  In better EC countries that use pure (but public) health\ninsurance (like we use in Canada) rather than self-enclosed HMO-like\nsocialized medicine, 30% of our costs comes from private supplementary\ninsurance and/or copayments.  France Magazine's Summer 1992 edition\nhas a fantastic presentation of their basic insurance coverage,\nincluding a sample chart of copayment percentages.  For 1-30 days,\nyou're covered for 80% of the public hospital rate, 100% afterward.\nWith extra private insurance, you can get into a private hospital and\nbe covered for any differences beyond the public hospital rate.  The\npublic insurance covers 100% beyond 30 days, or the same cash amount\nfor a private hospital and the difference is paid out-of-pocket or\naccording to your supplementary private insurance.  Over 2/3rds of\nFrench have some form of extra private insurance.  So, 30% of health\ncosts in Europe are out of private funds and not gleaned from other\ntaxes.  The GDP figures are combined public and private expenditures\nfor total outlay using the same methods that yield the 13-14% figure\nfor the U.S.\n\nThat the French had deductibles and copayments in their insurance fund\nis to their credit ... I am in the minority for advocating such back\nin Canada (to make the Canadian insurance look more like real health\ninsurance -- which actually it is).  The new Reform Party, a breakoff\nof traditionalists from the Conservatives with a mildly \"libertarian\"\nfaction, hold our public health insurance as an untouchable but that\njust a few people have to be reminded that it's not free (the average\nCanadian/European is more fiscally naive than their American\ncounterparts on issues like these).\n\nI'm one of the few people who favour copayments (forget about\nleftists, even our conservatives attack me for it on the Canadian\nnewsgroups) to make it look more like real insurance, 'cos the 100%\ninsurance payment is hidden (unlike in France) and if you didn't know\nit, you'd believe it actually is socialized medicine (American\nconservatives/libertarians and Canadian leftists are the only ones who\nseriously call it that).  Canadians aren't worried about the\nAmericans, who spend 14%; we're worried about the French and Germans\nwho spend 7% to our 9% ... so the insurance is looking at things that\nshouldn't be paid for out of general funds like physicals for\ninsurance policies, sick notes, electrolysis, etc.  The reason that\nthe Canadian health insurance hasn't spiralled out of control despite\nbeing open and universal is that unlike Americans, there is no urge to\nspend all of your benefits' worth, and more if you can ... we're a\ndifferent culture.\n\n\n\"Managed Care\" relies on HMO's, which are unknown in most western\nnations that use only public health insurance like Canada, France\nand Germany (I'm Canadian, and my German father-in-law-to-be says\nof HMO/NHS approaches, \"We left that behind with East Germany!\").\nSure, HMO/NHS controls costs because you have managers strangling\ndoctors with budget strings.\n\nIn Canada, we use the public health insurance approach as in France\nand Germany, with all private doctors and both private and public\nhospitals.  It is all pure insurance without HMO's.  The divisions\nare different, with the Germans using a couple hundred interlinked\n\"sickness funds\" over a century old while Canada divides by their\nprovinces (who run the insurance fund and set local fees with the\ndoctors monopoly; federal funds cover the fees disbursed.)\n\nWith such an open-ended system, it's no surprise that Canada is #2 to\nthe U.S. in costs; all-insurance is the most expensive way to go. The\nFrench and Germans use the same approach but have larger populations\nin more compact geography to improve scales of economy.\n\ngld","label":"talk.politics.misc"}

{"text":"Classify the following data:  \n: There are a couple of things about your post and others in this thread\n: that are a little confusing. An atheist is one for whom all things can\n: be understood as processes of nature - exclusively.\n\nThis definition does not include all atheists (see the FAQ). However,\nI (for one) do think there is no need to invoke any divine or\nspiritual explanations. \n\nIt makes a big difference to claim that all things can be understood\nas natural processes, and to claim that our observations do not\nrequire us to postulate any divine intervention, or anything spiritual,\nfor that matter. Humans are not omnipotent, and neither is science.\nHowever, science has one advantage theology doesn't: it is self-\ncorrecting, with nature as its judge. \n\nIt is delightful to see how scientific inquiry is revealing a self-\nconsistent, simple picture of our universe. Science is no longer\na bunch of separate branches, it is one. From particle physics to\npsychology. And no aspect of our life, or our universe, is safe\nfrom its stern and stony eye. Not even our consciousness.\n\n There is no need\n: for any recourse to Divnity to describe or explain anything. There is\n: no purpose or direction for any event beyond those required by\n: physics, chemistry, biology, etc.; everything is random, nothing is\n: determnined.\n\nActually, determinism vs. indeterminism is a philosophical question,\nand science cannot say whether the whole thing is actually somehow\nsuperdeterministic or not. I think the question does not have\nany meaning, as far as individual human beings go. If their apparent\nfree will is an illusion, it does not appear to be so from their\nperspective. Bill, can you say _for sure_ whether you have a free\nwill or not? \n\n: This would also have to include human intelligence of course and all\n: its products. There is nothing requiring that life evolve or that it\n: acquire intelligence, it's just a happy accident.\n\nMaybe. Who are we to tell? It seems intelligence is useful - when\nduring the history of Earth has _one species_ been able to control\none third of the whole biosphere? This can still be a result of \nnumerous happy accidents our genetic machinery blindly replicates\nand preserves. Even that machinery can be result of the same\nprinciple - only the systems that can start replicating will\nsurvive, those which don't don't make it. (Recommended reading: t.o)\n\n: For an atheist, no\n: event can be preferred to another or be said to have more or less\n: value than another in any naturalistic sense, and no thought -about-\n: an event can have value. \n\nFrom whose perspective? I value events and things subjectively, from\nmy perspective. Nature does not have values, because it does not have\na perspective - values arise from awareness. If I have a subjective\nperspective, it is easy to assume that other people also do, and if\nI think about what it would it be like in their position, I will\neventually discover the Golden Rule. Morality is not necessarily\na gift from heavens, in fact, it may be a product of evolution.\nPerhaps we are aware of ourselves because a sense of identity\nis helpful, allows us to play the roles of others and make us respect\nothers who seem to have identity, too. \n\nBill, have you ever read Aristotle? Try his Ethica Nikomakhea (sp.)\nfor starters.\n\n: How then can an atheist judge value? What is the basis for criticizing\n: the values ennumerated in the Bible or the purposes imputed to God? On\n: what grounds can the the behavior of the reliogious be condemned? It\n: seems that, in judging the values that motivate others to action, you\n: have to have some standard against which conduct is measured, but what\n: in nature can serve that purpose? What law of nature can you invoke to\n: establish your values.\n\nC.S. Lewis tells us that this argument was the main reason why\nhe abandoned his atheism and became Christian. The argument is\nseverely flawed.\n\nSome values, such as the Golden Rule, can have a rational basis. Some\nothers, like the basic idea of wanting to live, has probably its\nroots in the way our brains are wired. Lewis ignored the very real\npossiblity that natural selection could also favour altruistic\nbehaviour, and morality as well. Indeed, as humans evolved better\nand better in building and using tools, they also became better\nat killing each other. It is a logical necessity that evolution could\nonly favour those who knew how to use tools, but not against one's\nown people.\n\nThe Bible reveals quite nicely that the morality of the early Jews\nwas not beyond this. A simple set of rules to hold the people\ntogether, under one god. Their god did not care much about people\nof other nations. \n\nAt the time of the NT, things were quite different - the Jews\nwere under rule of an _empire_, and could no longer simply ignore\nthe Gentiles. A new situation required a new morality, and along\nwith it a new religion was born. (A mutation in a meme pool.)\n\n: Since every event is entirely and exclusively a physical event, what\n: difference could it possibly make what -anyone- does, religious or\n: otherwise, there can be no -meaning- or gradation of value. The only\n: way an atheist can object to -any- behaviour is to admit that the\n: objection is entirely subjective and that he(she) just doesn't like it\n: - that's it. Any value judgement must be prefaced by the disclaimer\n: that it is nothing more than a matter of personal opinion and carries\n: no weight in any \"absolute\" sense.\n\nIt looks like you haven't bothered to read philosophy. Whenever there\nis an observer, there is a subjective point of view, which may \nvalue its existence and happiness (even if that were just a result\nof some physical event), and other's happiness, too, if the observer\ncomes to think about it. In an absolutely objective sense, that is,\nwithout any observers or subjects, moral judgments lose their\nmeaning. \n\nIt is not possible for a value to simply exist without a point of\nview. This includes gods, too, their values are only _their_ \npersonal judgments, not absolute truths, since such truths\ndo not exist. \n\nThe fact that most people do not deliberately want to hurt others\nis a manifestation of the way we have fought for our existence\nby becoming social beings who can think and value others'\nexistence.\n\nMorality is not property of humans alone - chimps, dolphins and\nmany other species show great care for each other. Dolphins have\nsometimes saved humans from drowning, a good deed indeed. \n\n: That you don't like what God told people to do says nothing about God\n: or God's commands, it says only that there was an electrical event in your\n: nervous system that created an emotional state that your mind coupled\n: with a pre-existing thought-set to form that reaction. That your\n: objections -seem- well founded is due to the way you've been\n: conditioned; there is no \"truth\" content. The whole of your\n: intellectual landscape is an illusion, a virtual reality.\n\nThe last statement does not logically follow. In fact, there is\nevery reason to believe our thoughts can model reality very\nwell, and our senses can convey reliable information. Solipsism\nis still a logical possibility, but not a very likely one.\n\nYou are continuously mixing two different views: the subjective\npoint of view (which we all share) and an objective point of view,\n_which does not exist_. Any observer or thinker, any personal being,\nhas its own point of view. It does not matter whether this point\nof view is a result of some physical events or not, it does not\ncease to be subjective. \n\nFrom a non-observers non-point of view, values do not exist. Neither\ndoes pain, or pleasure, or beauty, or love. Such things are \ninherently subjective. \n\nOnce again, if god wants wives to submit to their husbands, or even\nto make a leap of faith into the unknown, or wants to punish us if\nwe don't, I disagree with his morals. I do not think my morals come\nfrom any supreme being - to remove my morals means the same than\nto make me a zombie, a machine without a single thought. If god\ngave us morality to judge, but I disagree with him, it is not my\nfault. He is free to replace my morals. I cannot see what is the\npoint of giving someone a moral system which disagrees with one's\nown and then to get mad at this. \n\nGod must be schizophrenic.\n\n: All of this being so, you have excluded\n: yourself from any discussion of values, right, wrong, goood, evil,\n: etc. and cannot participate. Your opinion about the Bible can have no\n: weight whatsoever.\n\nNeither can the opinion of any god, for that matter. I cannot understand\nwhy a subjective opinion of a thing made of matter is in any way\nless credible than an opinion of a thing made of something else.\n\nBill, take note: Absolute values must be independent of _any_ being,\n_including_ gods. If god has a subjective viewpoint, it is his\nown point of view, and his morals are his own. \n\nPetri\n","label":"alt.atheism"}

{"text":"Classify the following data: \nTrue.  At first, the news media seemed entranced by all the new gizmos\nthe military was using, not to mention the taped video transmissions from\nthe missiles as they zeroed in on their targets.  But later, and especially\nafter the bunker full of civilians was hit, they changed their tone.  It\nseemed to me that they didn't have the stomach for the reality of war,\nthat innocent people really do die and are maimed in warfare.  It's like\nthey were only pro-Gulf-War as long as it was \"nice and clean\" (smart\nmissiles dropping in on military HQs), but not when pictures of dead,\ndying, and maimed civilians started cropping up.  What naive hypocrites!\n\n\n[ discussion about blanket-bombing and A-bombs deleted.]\n                            ^^^^^^^^^\n\nI should have said here \"militarily justified\".  It seems from your\ncomments below that you understood this as meaning \"morally justified\".\nI apologize.\n\n\nI have often wondered about this.  I've always thought that the first bomb\nshould have been dropped on Japan's island fortress of Truk.  A good,\ninpenatrable military target.  The second bomb could've been held back\nfor use on an industrial center if need be.  But I digress.\n\nYes, I have heard that we found evidence (after the war, BTW) that Japan\nwas seriously considering surrender after the first bomb.  Unfortunately,\nthe military junta won out over the moderates and rejected the US's\nulimatum.  Therefore the second bomb was dropped.  Most unfortunate, IMO.\n\n\nI don't regret the fact that sometimes military decisions have to be made\nwhich affect the lives of innocent people.  But I do regret the \ncircumstances which make those decisions necessary, and I regret the\nsuffering caused by those decisions.  \n\n[...]\n\n\nActually, it was the fact that both situations existed that prompted US\nand allied action.  If some back-water country took over some other\nback-water country, we probably wouldn't intervene.  Not that we don't\ncare, but we can't be the world's policman.  Or if a coup had occured\nin Kuwait (instead of an invasion), then we still wouldn't have acted\nbecause there would not have been the imminent danger perceived to\nSaudi Arabia.  But the combination of the two, an unprovoked invasion\nby a genocidal tyrant AND the potential danger to the West's oil \ninterests, caused us to take action.\n\n\n[...]\n\nI'm not setting up a strawman at all.  If you want to argue against the\nwar, then the only logical alternative was to allow Hussein to keep\nKuwait.  Diplomatic alternatives, including sanctions, were ineffective.\n\nWell, in a sense, yes.  They probably had no idea of what end Hitler\nwould lead their nation to.\n\n\nThey suffered along with the rest.  Why does this bother you so much?\nThe world is full of evil, and circumstances are not perfect.  Many\ninnocents suffer due to the wrongful actions of others.  It it regretable,\nbut that's The-Way-It-Is.  There are no perfect solutions.\n\n[...]\n\nProbably because we're not the saviors of the world.  We can't police each\nand every country that decides to self-destruct or invade another.  Nor\nare we in a strategic position to get relief to Tibet, East Timor, or\nsome other places.\n\nTell me how we could stop them and I'll support it.  I, for one, do not\nagree with the present US policy of \"sucking up to them\" as you put it.\nI agree that it is deplorable.\n\n\nAre they?  Or are they supposed to reflect the population of the locale\nwhere the trial is held?  (Normally this is where the crime is committed\nunless one party or the other can convince the judge a change of venue\nis in order.)  I'm not an expert on California law, or even US law, but\nit seems that this is the way the system is set up.  You can criticize\nthe system, but let's not have unfounded allegations of racial \nprejudice thrown around.\n\n\nNo, not at all.  The point is that the fact that there were no blacks\non the first jury and that Rodney King is black is totally irrelevant.\n\n\nGermans, perhaps.  \"Peers\" doesn't mean \"those who do the same thing\",\nlike having murderers judge murderers.  It means \"having people from\nthe same station in life\", presumably because they are in a better\nposition to understand the defendent's motivation(s).\n\n\nOK, granted.  However, you are using this reasoning as part of *your*\nlogical argument in this discussion.  This is not a court of law.\n\nThe media is not totally monolithic.  Even though there is a prevailing\nliberal bias, programs such as the MacNeil-Lehrer News Hour try to give\na balanced and fair reporting of the news.  There are even conservative\nsources out there if you know where to look.  (Hurrah for Rush!)\n\nBTW, I never used the word \"conspiracy\".  I don't accept (without *far*\nmore evidence) theories that there is some all-pervading liberal\nconspiracy attempting to take over all news sources.\n\n\nHardly.  I didn't say that it's a Good Thing [tm] to kill innocent people\nif the end is just.  Unfortunately, we don't live in a perfect world and\nthere are no perfect solutions.  If one is going to  resist tyranny, then\ninnocent people on both sides are going to suffer and die.  I didn't say\nit is OK -- it is unfortunate, but sometimes necessary.\n\n\nI would agree that it was evil in the sense that it caused much pain\nand suffering.  I'm not so sure that it was unnecessary as you say.  That\nconclusion can only be arrived at by evaluating all the factors involved.\nAnd perhaps it *was* unnecessary as (let's say) we now know.  That doesn't\nmean that those who had to make the decision to bomb didn't see it as\nbeing necessary.  Rarely can one have full known of the consequences of\nan action before making a decision.  At the time it may have seemed\nnecessary enough to go ahead with it.\n\nBut don't assume that I feel the bombing was *morally* justified -- I\ndon't!  I just don't condemn those who had to make a difficult\ndecision under difficult circumstances.\n\n\nYou certainly are not in such a position if you are a moral relativist.\nI, as an absolutist, am in a position to judge, but I defer judgment.\n\n\nWrong.  They were neither moral then nor now.  They seemed necessary to\nthose making the decisions to bring a quick end to the war.  I simply\nrefuse to condemn them for their decision.\n\nOne day I will stand before Jesus and give account of every word and action;\neven this discourse in this forum.  I understand the full ramifications of\nthat, and I am prepared to do so.  I don't believe that you can make the\nsame claim.\n\n\nAnd BTW, the reason I brought up the blanket-bombing in Germany was\nbecause you were bemoaning the Iraqi civilian casualties as being \n\"so deplorable\".  Yet blanket bombing was instituted because bombing\nwasn't accurate enough to hit industrial/military targets in a\ndecisive way by any other method at that time.  But in the Gulf War,\nprecision bombing was the norm.  So the point was, why make a big\nstink about the relatively few civilian casualties that resulted\n*in spite of* precision bombing, when so many more civilians\n(proportionately and quantitatively) died under the blanket bombing\nin WW2?  Even with precision bombing, mistakes happen and some\ncivilians suffer.  But less civilians suffered in this war than\nany other iany other in history!  Many Iraqi civilians went about their lives\nwith minimal interference from the allied air raids.  The stories\nof \"hundreds of thousands\" of Iraqi civilian dead is just plain bunk.\nYes, bunk.  The US lost 230,000 servicemen in WW2 over four years\nand the majority of them were directly involved in fighting!  But \nwe are expected to swallow that \"hundreds of thousands\" of \n*civilian* Iraqis died in a war lasting about 2 months!  And with \nthe Allies using the most precise bombs ever created at that!  \nWhat hogwash.  If \"hundreds of thousands\" of Iraqi civilians died, \nit was due to actions Hussein took on his own people, not due to \nthe Allied bombing.\n\nRegards,","label":"alt.atheism"}

My son did get three stitches at the emergency room.  \n\nSpeaking as a physician who works in an urgent care center, the above\nbehavior is completely inappropriate. If a patient who requires extensive\ncare shows up at the last minute, we always see them and give them appropriate\ncare. It is reasonable for a clinic to refuse to see patients outside of its\nposted hours, but what you describe is misbehavior. Ask to speak to the\nclinic director, and complain.

{"text":"Classify the following data: Hi! Everyone,\n\nBecause no one has touched the problem I posted last week, I guess\nmy question was not so clear. Now I'd like to describe it in detail:\n\nThe offset of an ellipse is the locus of the center of a circle which\nrolls on the ellipse. In other words, the distance between the ellipse\nand its offset is same everywhere.\n\nThis problem comes from the geometric measurement when a probe is used.\nThe tip of the probe is a ball and the computer just outputs the\npositions of the ball's center. Is the offset of an ellipse still\nan ellipse? The answer is no! Ironically, DMIS - an American Indutrial\nStandard says it is ellipse. So almost all the software which was\nimplemented on the base of DMIS was wrong. The software was also sold\ninternationaly. Imagine, how many people have or will suffer from this bug!!!\nHow many qualified parts with ellipse were/will be discarded? And most\nimportantly, how many defective parts with ellipse are/will be used?\n\nI was employed as a consultant by a company in Los Angeles last year\nto specially solve this problem. I spent two months on analysis of this\nproblem and six months on programming. Now my solution (nonlinear)\nis not ideal because I can only reconstruct an ellipse from its entire\nor half offset. It is very difficult to find the original ellipse from\na quarter or a segment of its offset because the method I used is not\nanalytical. I am now wondering if I didn't touch the base and make things\ncomplicated. Please give me a hint.\n\nI know you may argue this is not a CG problem. You are right, it is not.\nHowever, so many people involved in the problem \"sphere from 4 poits\".\nWhy not an ellipse?

Additionally, \nthe pressure difference between the two tanks must be maintained to ~+/- 5 psi. \nThat is rather tight to be rocking and rolling on the train. The pressure \nstabilization is how centaur achieves the performance. On numerous occasions\n(when I was there 88-91) the AF wanted to see what it would take to make \na non-pressure stabilized centaur. The answer -- a centaur not worth launching. \n\nThe Atlas/Centaur does not require on-pad integration, however the T4/Centaur\ndoes.

{"text":"Classify the following data: Okay, lets get the record straight on the Livermore gas gun.  \nThe project manager is Dr. John Hunter, and he works for the\nLaser group at Livermore.  What, you may ask, does gas guns\nhave to do with lasers? Nothing, really, but the gun is physically\nlocated across the road from the Free Electron Laser building,\nand the FEL building has a heavily shielded control room (thick walls)\nfrom which the gun firings are controlled.  So I suspect that the\noffice he works for is an administrative convenience.\n\nI visited Hunter at the beginning of Feb. and we toured the gun.\nAt the time I was working on gas gun R&D at Boeing, where I work,\nbut I am now doing other things (helping to save the space station),\n\nThe gun uses a methane-air mixture, which is burned in a chamber\nabout 200 ft long by 16 inch ID (i.e. it looks like a pipe).\nThe chamber holds a 1 ton piston which is propelled at several\nhundred m/s down the chamber.  On the other side of the piston\nis hudrogen gas, initially at room temperature andsome tens\nof atmospheres.\n\nThe piston compresses and heats the hydrogen ahead of it until\na stainless steel burst diaphragm ruptures, at around 50,000 psi.\nThe barrel of the gun is about 100 feet long and has a 4 inch\nbore.  It is mounted at right angles to the chamber (i.e. they\nintersect).  This was done so that in the future, the barrel\ncould be raised and the gun fired into the air without having to\nmove the larger and heavier chamber.  The projectile being used\nin testing is a 5 kg cylinder of Lexan plastic, 4 in in diameter\nand about 50 cm long.\n\nAll of the acceleration comes from the expansion of the hydrogen\ngas from 50,000 psi downwards until the projectile leaves the\nbarrel.  The barrel is evacuated, and the end is sealed with a\nsheet of plastic film (a little thicker than Saran wrap).  The\nplastic is blown off by the small amount of residual air trapped\nin the barrel ahead of the projectile.  \n\nThe gun is fired into a bunker filled with sandbags and plastic\nwater jugs.  In the early testing fragments of the plastic\nprojectile were found.  At the higher speeds in later testing,\nthe projectile vaporizes.\n\nThe testing is into a bunker because the Livermore test range is\nabout 3 miles across, and the projectile would go 100-200 km\nif fired for maximum range.  The intent is to move the whole gun\nto Vandenberg AFB after the testing is complete, where they can\nfire into the Pacific Ocean, and use the tracking radar at VAFB\nto follow the projectiles.\n\nThe design goal of the gun is to throw a 5 kg projectile at 4\nkm/s (half of orbital speed).  So far they have reached 2 km/s,\nand the gun is currently down for repairs, as on the last test\nthey blew a seal and damaged some of the hardware (I think it\nhad to do with the methane-air more detonating than burning, but\nI haven't had a chance to talk to Hunter directly on this).\n\nThere are people waiting to test scramjet components in this\ngun by firing then out of the gun into the air (at Mach 12=\n4 km/s), since the most you can get in wind tunnels is Mach 8.\n\nThis gun cost about 4 million to develop, and is basically\na proof-of-concept for a bigger gun capable of firing useful-\nsized payloads into space.  This would require on the order of\n100 kg projectiles, which deliver on the order of 20 kg\nuseful payload to orbit.\n\nDani Eder\n","label":"sci.space"}

But the President \nbelieves his jobs program should go forward.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  George, would the President be willing to accept $8 \nbillion for one year, which apparently appears to be the compromise \nbeing offered by --\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, I don't know what is being \noffered by either side.  The Senate discussions are going on right \nnow, let's see what happens today.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Would he go that far -- no matter what the \nRepublicans have offered so far, would he go that far, $8 billion per \nyear?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The President believes that his \nprogram should be passed at this time.  Clearly, we're going to be \nwilling to listen to what the Senators might or might not be able to \ncome up with, but I'm not going to get into figures right now.  Let's \nsee what happens.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  It's reasonable to assume, isn't it, from what has \nhappened so far that a compromise is going to be necessary in order \nto get a vote?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, the Republicans seem more \nintrested in stopping progress on the President's jobs bill, than in \ndoing something to create --  MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, the \nRepublicans seem more interested in stopping progress on the \nPresident's jobs bill than in doing something to create real action, \nreal jobs this summer for the American people.  I think there's no \nquestion about that.  There's been some frustration of legislative \nactivity over the last few days.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  So, you'll need to compromise to get your package \nthrough?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  We'll see what happens with the \nconversations between Senator Mitchell and Senator Dole this morning.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t     prepared to compromise --\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The President's prepared to listen \nto what Senator Mitchell has to say this morning after his meeting \nwith Senator Dole. \n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Does he feel that he has been defeated in his --\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Not in the least.  In fact, he's \nbeen very successful so far in the beginning of his term.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  How?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  He passed his budget in record \ntime, in six weeks, and it's a budget which reduces the deficit by \n$500 billion over five years.  And it's a budget which provides for \nimportant investments in our future.  Right now we've also had strong \npassage of his jobs program through the House.  Simply because a \nminority of Republicans in the Senate choose to perpetuate gridlock \nand hold up action on the President's jobs program is not a sign that \nhe is not succeeding overall.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  He can't beat this, can he?\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  The fact is they can do that?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, the Republicans can stop \naction.  There's no question about that.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  What are you going to do about it?\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  George, what do you know about these alleged notes \ntaken by Boris Yeltsin during one of the meetings in which it appears \nthat the President told Boris Yeltsin not to trust the Japanese; that \nwhen they say yes they mean no?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think that's a complete \nmisreading of what happened at the meeting.  The context of the \nconversation was that President Clinton was actually reassuring \nPresident Yeltsin at the time about his conversations with Prime \nMinister Miyazawa over the Kuril Islands and the Prime Minister's \nbelief that Japan would play a constructive role in the G-7 process.  \nI mean this was a casual comment about Japanese courtesy and \netiquette but overall it was in the context of a conversation where \nhe was reassuring President Yeltsin that he believed the Japanese \nwere serious about their commitment to the G-7 process.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t   Are you saying that the President said that when \nthe Japanese say yes they mean no?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  That's not -- I don't know the \nexact words and there was a much longer discussion about he did say \nsomething along the lines that he believes that on this issue Prime \nMinister Miyazawa intends to really go forward with the G-7 process.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Have there been any attempts to explain this to the \nJapanese because apparently the Japanese press has picked this up and \nthere appears to be --\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I've seen the reports in the \nJapanese press and it actually does put the situation in context.  It \ndoes talk about the Japanese -- understanding the Japanese points of \nview.  I don't think it's going to be a problem.  I believe that \nthere may have been some diplomatic context just to clear things up \nbut I'm not positive.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  George, was the specific comment that was made \nspecific to the Kuril Island situation or was it a general \nobservation on Japanese etiquette?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The discussion was about --\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  The specific comment is what I'm asking about that \nhas alleged to have been translated from the Russian notes, \"when the \nJapanese say yes they mean no.\"\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, it was a combination.  I mean \nI don't think that's the whole sentence.  I think that the specific \ncomment was a broad, general observation followed up by a specific \nfinish to the sentence where he said in this case he believes that \nPrime Minister Miyazawa means to keep the commitment.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Was he saying it facetiously first?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think it was just a casual \nobservation.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  And then you say diplomatic contacts were made to \nclear it up.  Has the President sent a message?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No, I don't think the President \nspoke; I believe that Secretary Christopher has made some calls but \nI'm not sure exactly how many.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Well, this obviously is a bigger deal than you're \nmaking it out to be if Christopher has had to make some calls.\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No, no.  It was just that we got \nthe reports in Vancouver and the Secretary wanted to make sure that \nit was understood and make sure there was absolutely no \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  -- reports in Vancouver, and the \nSecretary wanted to make sure that it was understood, and make sure \nthere is absolutely no misunderstanding, and I don't believe there is \non.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  What is our position about the Japanese?  That they \nmay have to say one thing, but actualy mean another?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No.  The position on the Japanese \nis as the President stated to President Yeltsin throughout the two \ndays.  He said that he had had a good conversation with Prime \nMinister Miazawa prior to the Summit.  He reiterated the U.S. \nposition, the long-standing support for the Japanese position on the \nKuril Islands, but also reiterated Prime Minister Miazawa's \ncommitment to move forward on the G-7 process and to play a \nconstructive role.  And I think President Yeltsin was very glad to \nhear that.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  After listening to Secretary Christopher on Iraq \nfor the last few days, I'm a little confused.  What is the U.S. \npolicy?  Do you want to see Saddam Hussein overturned?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  It's the same policy that Secretary \nChristopher has reiterated, and all of the U.S officials have \nreiterated.  We expect full and complete and unequivocal compliance \nwith all U.N. resolutions.  Right now we do not have that compliance.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t     throwing it out further that if Iraq complies, \nSaddam can't stay in office?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Right.  I think that that's -- our \njudgment is that it is not possible for Saddam Hussein to comply with \nthe resolutions and stay in power.  But the important point is that \nwe expect compliance by Iraq with all U.N. resolutions, and we will \ncontinue to demand it.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  And are you concerned the Iran will become the \ndominant power in the area --\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Secretary Christopher has also \nspoken to Iran over the last several days, and he says we also expect \nfull Iranian compliance with all international norms, and stopping \nsupport of terrorism.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  That's a very glib statement that he won't stay in \npower if he complies with U.N. resolutions.  On what logic do you \nbase that?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Right now Saddam Hussein is not \ncomplying with the U.N. resolutions at all.  He is not respecting the \nrights of his people, as is required by the U.N. resolution.  He is \nnot fully complying with all the resolutions regarding inspections.  \nHe is not fully complying with all the resolutions regarding \narmaments.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Well, when do you think that if he did comply he \nwould be out of power?\n\n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, right now his power rests on \nthe repression of his people.  If he stopped doing that it would make \nit more difficult for him to stay in power.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  George, back on the stimulus package, why is it \nthat you and the President accuse the Republicans of playing pure \npolitics and perpetuating gridlock?  Why is it that -- what evidence \ndo you have that they just don't have a genuine idealogical \ndifference with you that's in good faith?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, the fact that several times \nin the past the Republicans, many of the ones who are now leading the \nfight for the filibuster, have supported the very funding they now \nseek to stop, most especially, the highway funding.  \n\t     \n\t     Q\t  George, in regards to that, some of the moderate \nRepublicans said that the White House erred by not being more open to \nthem during the -- while the plan was put together, that they had \none, sort of, proforma meeting between the White House and the Senate \nRepublicans, and that was it.  Does the Administration look back and \nthinks perhaps it could have done a better job of working with some -\n-\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, I'm not sure that it's true \nthat there was only one meeting.  I mean, the President met with the \nRepublican leadership on at least two occasions before the \nintroduction of his package.  He met with the entire Senate \nRepublican Caucus also for lunch, and went up there.  We are \ncontinually in contact with as many Republicans as we can find who \nhave an interest in the President's package.  We are interested in \nwhat they have to say, as well.  But we believe that this program is \nimportant, and we're going to continue to fight for it.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t     your all or nothing, do it with the Democrats \nalone strategy, did you maybe miscalculate the ability to get it \nthrough?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, I mean, I think that there is \nno question that under the Senate rules a determined minority can \nfrustrate activity.  I mean, there is just no question about that.  \nYou only need 40 plus one to keep going.  40 plus one to keep going \nand to stop any action, and that's what the Republicans are doing.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t     going to rethink the way you attempt to get \nother things passed as you go through this process for the rest of \nthe summer?\n\t     \n\t     Q\t     work with Republicans and try to woo some \nRepublicans into your camp?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think we're going to continue to \nlook for the support of Republicans whenever we can get it on the \nPresident's intiatives?\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  But on this one -- how are you going to do it \ndifferently than you did it on this one because on this one you \nreally did stiff the Republicans from the beginning and made it clear \nthat it was a Democratic majority that would get this through and \ncould get it through and you really didn't need Republican votes?  \nAre you going to take a different tack when you have to go for \nparticular votes?  When you have to go through --\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I can't see into the future and \nunderstand every possible turn in the legislative road.  Clearly the \nPresident's going to continue to reach out when he can.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  You don't have any regrets then about the way you \nhave handled it up to now and you don't plan any changes in your \napproach in dealing with the Republicans in Congress based on this \nexperience?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Obviously the President would like \nhis package passed as quickly as possible and he's going to continue \nto press for that.  We will continue to reach out to Republicans, \nthere's not question about that.  And we'll continue to reason with \nthem and try and find appropriate avenues for cooperation.  In this \ncase the Republicans have chosen to unify around a filibuster, around \na plan to frustrate action not a plan to move forward.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  They're being denied any other legislative means of \nputting their proposals forward.\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think they're being --\n\t     \n\t     Q\t     any ideas.\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think their amendments are being \ndefeated; I don't know that they're being denied.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t     to present them.\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  That's not exactly true.  I mean \nthey get the votes --\n\t     \n\t     Q\t     that theirs can be passed though by the \nparliamentary rules under which they're playing.\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Unless they get a majority in \nsupport all the way around, no, that's not exactly true.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  George, one more on Iraq.  Is the administration \nbacking any of the Iraqi opposition?  Grooming any new leadership?\n\t     \n\t     Q\t     backing any of the Iraqi -- leadership?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Oh, I -- again, we're pressing for \nIraqi compliance.  I don't know if we can get into the business of \ngrooming leadership.  I believe there have been some contacts, at \nsome levels, with Iraqi opposition groups.  I don't know  about \nanything recently.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t     Jesse Jackson, who, of course, is not the \nPresident's best friend, has, however, been told that there is to be \nsome kind of town meeting, or some kind of involvement by the \nPresident, pre-empted the ball game -- Los Angeles.  Will he consider \nsomething like that, or any other kind of intervention there?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, as you know, the President \nappointed Commerce Secretary Ron Brown, about 10 days ago, to be a \nspecial envoy to California, and coordiante cabinet activities around \nthe California economic situation, including the situation in Los \nAngeles.  \n\t     \n\t     I believe there will also be visits out to Los Angeles \nby the Education -- or have been visits by the Education Secretary, \nMr. Riley.  I believe that Transportation Secretary Pena and HUD \nSecretary Cisneros are also going out.  And there may be other visits \nby Cabinet officials over the next several days and weeks.  I \nwouldn't rule out the possibility of a visit by President Clinton to \nCalifornia.  Obviously, he is following the situation closely, and is \nconcerned about making sure that we make the right long term policy \ndecisions that will help create the kind of economic opportunities \nwhich help prevent disturbances.  But we're going to continue to \nwatch it.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  George, as a follow-up, Reverend Jackson is also \nsupposed to be outside the ball park today, in Baltimore, with a \ngroup of supporters protesting the lack of minorities in baseball \nmanagement.  Does the President have a position on that?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The President has received \ncorrespondence from Reverend Jackson.  I know that Reverend Jackson \nhas also spoken with the White House Chief of Staff, Mack McLarty.  \nHe clearly raises serious questions.  There has been some progress in \nbaseball over the last several years, but still not enough.  But the \nPresident intends to continue to go to the ball game.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Is he going to say anything about it today, or see \nReverend Jackson while he's out there?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know if he is going to see \nthem, but as I said, the President believes that Reverend Jackson has \nraised some serious questions, and it's something that, as I said, \neven though there has been progress, it's clearly not enough.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Did Reverend Jackson ask him not to go to the ball \ngame?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I'm not sure about that.  I believe \nthe characterization the Reverend Jackson is talking about is an \ninformational pickett.  I don't know that he asked him not to go to \nthe ball game, but he sent a long, detailed, formal letter outlining \nhis concerns with the situation in major league baseball and the \nPresident read it.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  George, the Orioles are playing the Rangers, the \nmanaging partner of the Rangers is George W. Bush.  Is he going to be \nthere, and is he going to meet with the President?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I don't know.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  What is the Mubarak schedule?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I know that President Mubarak is \ncoming tomorrow morning for a working meeting, they will have a \nlunch, and I believe that he is having dinner tonight with Vice \nPresident Gore.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  And joint statements tomorrow --\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I believe so, yes.  At the end, \nyes.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Is there evidence, George, that the Egyptians did \nwarn the U.S. about a potential terrorist bombing -- terrorist \nactivities?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  As reported in The New York Times, \nI mean, I think that President Mubarak did say that there has been \ngeneral conversations with the Egyptians, as there have been for a \nlong period of time.  We do have general intelligence sharing, I \nmean.  But President Mubarak was very careful to point out that there \nwas no specific information on this visit that was passed forward.  \nThe President will continue to investigate the situation, but he also \nreiterates his belief that we cannot tolerate terrorism of any kind.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  George, he did make specific -- or the Egyptians, \napparently, did issue specific warnings about this individual who, \nforgive me --this individual who, forgive me the name escapes me at \nthe moment, and said the Egyptians were more or less rebuffed in \ntheir attempts to get some kind of action.\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Again, I don't know if I would \nagree with your characterization of the Mubarak interview.  He did \nsay that they gave general warnings about the possibility of a \nnetwork in the United States and upon which we took appropriate \naction.  But there was no specific information on this specific \noperation at all.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  So, the White House doesn't feel that any of the \nlaw enforcement agencies whether it be the CIA or FBI who would have \nreceived this kind of information was lax or derelict in its duty in \nnot pursuing some kind of --\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  No, not at all.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  What's next with Serbia?  It got only a passing \nmention in the news conference yesterday --\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  You didn't get to ask your \nquestion.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Yes, exactly.  Was there any agreement on concerted \naction between the two countries?  And even if there wasn't, what \ndoes the U.S. do next?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think the U.S. is clearly going \nto move forward in the U.N. today continuing discussions with our \nallies on a sanctions resolution and we'll continue to look for ways \nto press the Serbians to come to the negotiating table and sign an \nagreement.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  George, why do you think sanctions is still an \noption?  I mean the Serbians make it clear that at least the \nleadership is surviving just fine and they feel like they can wait \nyou out and even the administration officials we had in the other day \nsaid there's no evidence that they're going to have an effect any \ntime soon.  The Bosnian Serbs have said no to the peace plan.  When \ndoes no mean no and you have to do something different?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Well, I mean we are doing something \ndifferent.  We're moving forward on further sanctions through the \nU.N. and those discussions will continue.  We're going to continue to \ntry and tighten the noose on Serbia, and I think that every \nopportunity we have to do that will have an effect over time.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Are we looking again at lifting the arms embargo? \nMR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  The President has said that this is something \nthat is under consideration.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  George, do you have any more on Hugh Rodham's \ncondition, how he's doing?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  As far as I know nothing's changed.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  George, -- week after Mr. Mubarak?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  It's a little unclear.  I think \nwe'll be able to get you more either tonight or tomorrow morning \nafter the Mubarak visit.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Is he going somewhere for Easter?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Not that I know of.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  What more can you tell us about the additional aid \nto Russia that the President plans to ask Congress about?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  He's going to be consulting with \nthe Congress and with our G-7 partners over the next couple of weeks.  \nI know that he spoke last evening with Congressman Gephardt and their \ndelegation before the -- the congressional delegation meets with the \nRussians this week and those consultations will continue over the \nnext several weeks.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Do you expect that package to be of the magnitude \nof the one announced Sunday?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I'm not going to discuss the \nmagnitude.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  How about the list of Cold War restrictions, where \ndo you stand on that --\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  As the President said yesterday, \nhe's going to be looking for that list from the Congress this week \nand reviewing it.  He believes -- he's going to try and get it this \nweek and he's going to review the list, and we're going to take a \nhard look at it.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  But they're making it up?  I mean it's no White \nHouse involvement, Congress is compiling this list?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  I think he's going to talk to the \ncongressional leaders about compiling the list but I'm certain we'll \nbe able to get our own researchers working as well.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  George, isn't lifting the arms embargo more of a \nprobability than a possibility?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  It's something that's under \ndiscussion.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Secretary Christopher has said that it's a matter \nof time and -- for months before that happens.\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  Again, all I can say is that it's \nsomething that the President is reviewing.  Right now we're working \nwith our allies in the U.N on a sanctions resolution, and we'll \ncontinue to review other matters.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  George, can you tell us anything about the schedule \nthis week?  Any travel?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  They just asked about that.  I \ndon't have anything more beyond tomorrow's visit with Mubarak right \nnow.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Are there consultations, George, with any Jewish \nAmerican organizations concerning Jackson-Vanick?\n\t     \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  As you know the National Conference \nof Soviet Jewry has a list of, I believe, \n\t     MR. STEPHANOPOULOS:  -- as you know, the National \nConference of Soviet Jewry has a list of, I believe, 200 Refuseniks.  \nWe'll certainly take a look at that and continue appropriate \ndiscussions.\n\t     \n\t     Thanks.\n","label":"talk.politics.misc"}

You would think the fact \nthat the conservatives seem to have to break out the tophat-and-cane \nand give you some big song-and-dance routine about why this \n(other passages as well) aren't directly applicable today would \nshow them that what they claim about the Bible and what they \nactually practice are two different things, but mostly it doens't.\n\nWhile this thread is supposed to be about the arrogance of Christians,\nI would suggest that some of the problem is really hypocrasy, in this\ncase, making claims about the Bible which the claimants don't actually\nput into practice. But if we step back from the name-calling and\nlook at what people are attempting to say, we see that they are trying\nto express very concisely the unique place the Bible holds within the\nChristian faith. So when people use such words or phrases as \"Word of\nGod\", \"inerrant\", \"infallibale\", \"The Manufacturer's Handbook\", \"The\nonly rule of faith and practice in the church today\" to describe the\nBible, we should try to hear what they are saying and not just look at\nthe mere words they use. Some of the above descriptions are demostratably\nfalse and others are self-contradictory, but in my experience people are\ngenerally pretty good at picking out the intention of the speaker even\nwhen the speaker's words are at variance with their intentions. A Biblical\nexample is from the garden of Eden where God asks \"Where are you?\" and Adam\nexplains that he was naked and afraid and hid himself. If Adam had\nanswered God's words he would have said something like \"I'm here in this\ntree.\" The problem seems to arise when Christians insist that these\nwords are indeed accurate reflections of their beleif. Most people\nhave not made a determined effort to work out their own understanding of\nthe place of the Bible within their own faith and so rely on the phrases\nand explanations that others use.\n\nI hope this helps.\n--\n                                                                     ___\nBill Rea                                                            (o o)\n-------------------------------------------------------------------w--U--w---","label":"soc.religion.christian"}

{"text":"Classify the following data: Thanks for the resposes as they were all good ideas and I am looking at using a\ncouple of the ideas. I recieved in the mail today the spec sheets on the mil.\nspec version of Exar's XR-2240 timer/counter chip. It is stable down to -50 C\nand sucks very little power. They show an application for a ultra-long time\ndelay (up to several years depending on the RC time constant). In this\napplication, they have two of them cascaded together. The reset and trigger\npins of both chips are tied together and the timebase of the second chip is\ndisabled. In this configuration, the output is high when the system is reset.\nWhen triggered, the output goes low and stays that way for a total of 65,536 x\nthe timing cycle of the first chip. The total timing cycle of the two chips can\nbe programmed from To = 256 x R x C to 65,536 x R x C in 256 steps by selecting\nany combination of the counter outputs to the timer output. The beauty of it\nis, the timebase chip would only have to have a 100uF timing cap and a 391K\nresistor for 39.1 seconds per timing cycle. So I can get a maximum of\n2,562,457.6 seconds between timing cycles (39.1 x 65,536 or about 29 days !)\nOf course, that's much more than I need (14 days). But the counter allows for\n256 binary steps that can be selected for the output for the 'pellet puker'.\nAfter the first 14 days and it trips, it would reset its self for the next 14\nday timing cycle and so forth.\n\nPower is still a problem though. A few ideas that you suggested was to bury the\nelectronics in a hole dug in the snow (as an insulator) and put the pellet\npuker up on a tower above the estimated snow fall with a solar panel on it to\nkeep a charge on a lithium battery pack. I like that idea ;-) This thing has to\nwork for at least six weeks for three samples and the gas valves are 12 volts\nto spit the pellets out onto the snow. Anyway, I ordered the XR-2240's to see\nwhat I can do with them. Should be interesting (as long as I'm not the one that\nhas to go digging up the pellets in the middle of Antartica freezing my buns\noff ;-)\n\nThanks again everyone...","label":"sci.electronics"}

First get your lds-facts straight before you dare preaching to us\nabout \"the only true God,\" whom you interpret according to your own likes\nand dislikes, but whose image I cannot reconcile with what I know about\nHim myself.  I guess your grandiose self-image does not allow for other\nfaiths, believing in the divinity of Jesus Christ, but in a different\nway or fashion than your own.

The indication from Rick is that they may\n#  certainly be.\n\nThe issue is, of course, that you love to use anything to either mis-\nrepresent or ridicule the lds church.  The issue of \"official doctrine\"\nis obviously very important.  McConkie's views have been controversial\n(e.g. \"The Seven Deadly Heresies\" has made me a heretic!  ;-) at best,\nor erroneous at worst (\"blacks not to receive the priesthood in this\ndispensation\").  I respect him as someone who has made his valuable\ncontribution to the church, but I personally do NOT rely on his personal\ninterpretations (his book \"Mormon Doctrine\" is oftentimes referred to\nas \"McConkie's Bible\" in mormon circles) on mormon doctrine.  I rather\nlook to official (doctrinal) sources, and... to Hugh Nibley's books!\n(The last comment is an lds-insider reference.)  Summarizing: McConkie\nwas a wise man who contributed undoubtedly far more to the kingdom of\nGod than I have, but whose views are by no means dogma or accepted\ndoctrine, some of it clearly belongs to personal interpretation and\nspeculation.  But having said this, I find McConkie (even in his most\nbiased and speculative moments) far more thought-provoking than the\ntrash coming from your proverbial pen.

{"text":"Classify the following data: The FLYERS team that can beat any team on any night showed up at the Spectrum\nSunday night, and dominated the Maple Leafs thoroughly en route to a 4-0\nshutout. Tommy Soderstrom will get credit for the shutout, but he barely broke\na sweat until the third period as the FLYERS defense kept the Leafs from\nmounting any serious attack.\n\nInjuries:\n\nPelle Eklund is day-to-day with a bruised thigh.\n\nRoster Moves:\n\nJason Bowen was added to the lineup for his first NHL game. Jason was the FLYERS\nsecond pick in the first round (15th overall) of the 1992 entry draft. 19 years\nold, 6'4\", 210 lbs. In 62 games with the tri-city Americans he had 10 goals,\n12 assists and 219 PIM. He plays left wing and defense, he played defense in\nthis game although Bobby Taylor said that Bill Dineen was planning to use him\nup front as well.\n\nAndre Faust was returned to Hershey. He actually left after the second period\nof the Kings game, flew to Albany, got the game tying goal in a Bears OT win,\nand played again for Hershey Sunday night.\n\nLines:\n\nFedyk-Lindros-Recchi\nBeranek-Brind'Amour-Dineen\nLomakin-Butsayev-Conroy\nActon-Brown\n\nGalley-McGill\nYushkevich-Cronin\nCarkner-Hawgood\nBowen\n\nTommy Soderstrom in goal.\n\nActon replaced Lomakin in the 3rd period.\n\nGame Summary:\n\nIf the FLYERS played like this every night, they'd be in the playoffs this\nyear. The FLYERS hit everything that moved. They created scoring chance after\nscoring chance. They snuffed out everything that the Leafs tried to do.\n\nJason Bowen made a good play on his first NHL shift that almost created a goal.\nHe had the puck in the top of the left offensive circle all alone, but instead\nof taking the shot he found Brind'Amour crashing the net on the other side.\nA perfect pass and a good shot across Daren Puppa's body should have been a\ngoal, but Puppa made a great save reading the play.\n\nGarry Galley gave the Maple Leafs 7th ranked power play the first chance when\nhe hooked Doug Gilmour at 4:25. The FLYERS lowly 21st ranked penalty killing\nunit was almost flawless the entire game, and set the tone on this kill. The\nMaple Leafs got almost nothing but long unscreened shots, and the defense swept\naway every rebound.\n\nAfter the power play, the FLYERS got a goal on an ugly play. Rod Brind'Amour\ngave the puck to Greg Hawgood at the right point, and he sent a drive at the\nnet. Puppa made the save and kicked the rebound right into the feet of Josef\nBeranek and Bob Rouse, who were wrestling in the slot. Beranek was able to\nget his stick on the puck and push it out to Dineen who was skating into\nthe slot from the right circle, and he lifted a backhander over Puppa for\na 1-0 FLYERS lead at 8:10.\n\nThe FLYERS kept the pressure on, and Puppa was the only Leaf keeping the FLYERS\nfrom building on their lead for a while. Eventually things settled down and\ndefense prevailed. Each team got an occasional scoring chance, but the goalies\nwere strong. Bowen started giving some Lindros-like checks in his own corners.\nThen Lindros, who was looking to avenge a hit Foligno gave him, thought he had\na chance to even the score. He had Foligno lined up at center ice, leaned into\nhim, and rode him into the center ice boards. The only problem was that Foligno\nwas a little far from the boards, and Mike \"Mister\" McGeough felt that it\nwarranted a boarding call at 15:38\n\nThe Leafs couldn't get anything going on the power play as the FLYERS were\nvery aggressive (for a change) on the kill.\n\nWith time running out in the period, Recchi carried through the neutral zone\nand handed to Lindros as they approached the Leaf's blue line. They were in\na crowd with Wendell Clark and Jamie Macoun, Lindros tried a backhand pass\nto Recchi through the feet of Macoun that connected to Recchi, but then Clark\nchecked Recchi off the puck. Macoun then tried to clear, but it was weak and\nwent right to McGill who had manned the point. He drove it from just inside\nthe blue line. Macoun got his stick on it and deflected it past his own\ngoalie at 19:55.1. Shots were 13-8 FLYERS in the period.\n\nThe FLYERS finally got their first chance on the power play when Dave Andreychuk\ntripped up Rod Brind'Amour in his offensive zone. During the power play, the\nFLYERS got cheated a little when the puck popped up into the air and Eric\ngloved it down, but McGeough thought it hit his stick above his head. We\ncould see from our seats at the other end of the ice that it only hit his glove\nand the replay confirmed, but the faceoff went to the other end. As time was\nrunning out in the advantage, Lindros found Galley with a pass across the goal\nmouth but Puppa made the save. The rebound kicked back to the right corner where\nRecchi picked it up, passed it out to Eric crashing through the right circle,\nand Eric one-timed past Puppa at 7:55. With the assist, Recchi moves past\nBobby Clarke's 74-75 season, the second best one season total for a FLYER at\n117.  Eric moves up to 4th all time in FLYERS rookie scoring with 67 points.\n\nMike Eastwood took down Al Conroy at 8:30 to give the FLYERS another chance on\nthe power play. Not much pressure before Garry Galley ended the power play with\na slash at 9:19. Not much happened on the 4 on 4, although the Leafs had most\nof the possession. The FLYERS smothered the Leafs short power play. Tempers\nflared a little at 13:14. Bowen and Pearson got roughing minors, Keith Acton\ngot a bloody face. Dave McLlwain then took a dive and got Greg Hawgood a\nhooking minor at 13:46 to set up a 4 on 3. The replay showed that Hawgood's\nstick stopped making contact with McLlwain long before he spun around and fell.\nAgain the FLYERS smothered the Leafs power play, led by Dimitri Yushkevich.\nBowen made a thundering hit when he came out of the box on Pearson. Berehowski\ntried to perplex everybody with his sloooowball. He had the puck at the point,\nand just trickled a pass down the slot. He made all the FLYERS look silly as\nnobody could get a stick on it, and it got to Gilmour at the side of the net,\nbut Soderstrom stoned him.\n\nThe FLYERS picked things up offensively after the kill was over, but didn't\nget anything home. Shots were 13-10 FLYERS.\n\nThe FLYERS were content with the 3 goal lead in the third period, and they\ndecided that if Tommy wanted a shutout, he was going to have to work for it a\nlittle.\n\nThe FLYERS got most of the scoring chances in the first 7 or so minutes of the\nperiod, but couldn't get past Puppa. Then the Leafs got tired of Lindros making\nroad kill out of them, and tempers flared. 2 each for Doug Gilmour and Lindros \n(unsportsmanlike conduct) and 2 each for Glenn Anderson and McGill (roughing)\nall at 7:02. Terry Carkner then took a kneeing penalty at 7:51 on Gilmour.\n\nAgain the FLYERS smothered the Leafs power play.\n\nAt about the 12 minute mark, Dave Andreychuk got a shot away from his left\ncircle that got through Soderstrom. The puck was rolling on it's side, and\nas luck would have it it turned away from the net instead of turning towards\nit (think of how a rolling quarter inevitably starts to lean one way or the\nother). Seconds later Rod Brind'Amour tripped up Gilmour at 12:24 to give the\nLeafs another chance on the power play. On the advantage, after Soderstrom\nstoned Andreychuk while lying down, Andreychuk got the rebound through\nSoderstrom, but from behind the net and it went straight through and was swept\naway by one of his defensemen. They kept the pressure on, but Soderstrom was\nequal and preserved the shutout.\n\nRecchi cross checked Ken Baumgartner to get tempers hot and start a brawl\nat 16:01. No punches thrown, Recchi got the initial minor, Krushelnyski\nBaumgartner and Lindros each got roughing minors. At 17:02 Rouse and Beranek\nexpressed their mutual dislike for each other and got 2 each for slashing to\nset up another 4 on 4. Mike Eastwood shoved down Ryan McGill in the FLYERS\nzone as they were battling for the puck, and while McGill was down he ran\nhis stick across McGill's face. The FLYERS were not happy with that at all.\n5-8 Al Conroy paired up with 6-1 Berehowski, and started throwing punches.\nUpward. Well, Al held his own, much to the delight of the crowd. Each got\na couple punches in before going down in a head, and Al got a standing O!\nPenalties: Eastwood 5 (cross check) + game, Clark, Carkner 10 each. Berehowski\nand Conroy 5 each (fighting) at 17:49.\n\nSo a major penalty for the rest of the game for the FLYERS. The had no interest\nin stting on the lead. Hawgood, Galley and Brind'Amour played catch until\nHawgood found Dineen all alone in the left circle, he controlled the puck and\nblasted it past Puppa at 18:39.\n\nThat was all the fireworks, Tommy Soderstrom would not face another shot. Puppa\ndid, but kept the FLYERS off the board. 4-0 FLYERS, shots were 9-8 FLYERS in the\n3rd. Probably the strongest game I've seen from the FLYERS since the All Star\nbreak. Shutout number 4 for Soderstrom, all since 1/10. Tied for 2nd most in\nthe NHL, but he's played fewer games than Belfour (6) or the goalie I can't\nremember that he's tied with.\n\nNext up it's the Winnipeg Selannes Tuesday night in Winnipeg. The FLYERS cannot\nbe eliminated if they win, but a loss coupled with an Islander win that night\nin Washington would be the official end.\n\nFLYERS up to 71 points on the season in 78 games. Last year they had 75 points\nin 80 games (5 under .500), so they need at least 8 points in their last 6\ngames to improve on that only by percentage points (5 under in 84 is better\nthan 5 under in 80).\n\nTragic number holds at 3 points with 6 games left. The tragic number for 5th\nis 5 points, I watched the Rangers blow a 4-2 third period lead at home to\nlose 5-4 before I finished this up. Why 5 points instead of 4? Well, the FLYERS\nwill win the tie-breaker if they catch them, whereas the Islanders win tie\nbreakers against the FLYERS and so need only a tie. The Rangers could crumble\ndown the stretch as they play the Devils, the Pens twice, the FLYERS, and\nfinish up with 2 games against the Caps. So I guess 5th place could be the\ngoal for the team to focus on.\n\nFLYERS team record watch:\n\nEric Lindros:\n\n38 goals, 29 assists, 67 points\n\n(rookie records)\nclub record goals:\t\t\tclub record points:\nEric Lindros\t38 1992-93\t\tDave Poulin\t76 1983-84\nBrian Propp\t34 1979-80\t\tBrian Propp\t75 1979-80\nRon Flockhart\t33 1981-82\t\tRon Flockhart\t72 1981-82\nDave Poulin\t31 1983-84\t\tEric Lindros\t67 1992-93\nBill Barber\t30 1972-73\t\tPelle Eklund\t66 1985-86\n\nMark Recchi:\n\n51 goals, 66 assists, 117 points.\n\nclub record goals:\t\t\tclub record points:\nReggie Leach\t61 1975-76\t\tBobby Clarke\t119 1975-76\nTim Kerr\t58 1985-86,86-87\tMark Recchi\t117 1992-93\nTim Kerr\t54 1983-84,84-85\tBobby Clarke\t116 1974-75\nMark Recchi\t51 1992-93\t\tBill Barber\t112 1975-76\nRick Macliesh\t50 1972-73\t\tBobby Clarke\t104 1972-73\nBill Barber\t50 1975-76\t\tRick Macliesh\t100 1972-73\nReggie Leach\t50 1979-80\n\nFLYERS career years:\n\nPlayer\t\tPoints\tBest Prior Season\nMark Recchi\t117\t113 (90-91 Penguins)\nRod Brind'Amour\t79\t77 (91-92 FLYERS)\nGarry Galley\t58\t38 (84-85 Kings)\nBrent Fedyk\t58\t35 (90-91 Red Wings)\n\nThat's all for now...","label":"rec.sport.hockey"}

{"text":"Classify the following data: [An article from comp.org.eff.news, EFFector Online 5.06 - Carl]\n\n                       April 16, 1993\n\n      INITIAL EFF ANALYSIS OF CLINTON PRIVACY AND SECURITY  \n                           PROPOSAL\n\n       The Clinton Administration today made a major announcement \non cryptography policy which will effect the privacy and security of \nmillions of Americans.  The first part of the plan is to begin a \ncomprehensive inquiry into major communications privacy issues \nsuch as export controls which have effectively denied most people \neasy access to robust encryption as well as law enforcement issues \nposed by new technology.\n\n       However, EFF is very concerned that the Administration has \nalready reached a conclusion on one critical part of the inquiry, before \nany public comment or discussion has been allowed.  Apparently, the \nAdministration is going to use its leverage to get all telephone \nequipment vendors to adopt a voice encryption standard developed \nby the National Security Agency. The so-called \"Clipper Chip\" is an \n80-bit, split key escrowed encryption scheme which will be built into \nchips manufactured by a military contractor.  Two separate escrow \nagents would store users' keys, and be required to turn them over \nlaw enforcement upon presentation of a valid warrant.  The \nencryption scheme used is to be classified, but they chips will be \navailable to any manufacturer for incorporation into their \ncommunications products.\n\n       This proposal raises a number of serious concerns .\n\n       First, the Administration appears to be adopting a solution \nbefore conducting an inquiry.  The NSA-developed Clipper chip may \nnot be the most secure product. Other vendors or developers may \nhave better schemes. Furthermore, we should not rely on the \ngovernment as the sole source for Clipper or any other chips.  Rather,\nindependent chip manufacturers should be able to produce chipsets \nbased on open standards.\n\n       Second, an algorithm can not be trusted unless it can be tested. \nYet the Administration proposes to keep the chip algorithm \nclassified.  EFF believes that any standard adopted ought to be public \nand open.  The public will only have confidence in the security of a \nstandard that is open to independent, expert scrutiny.  \n\n       Third, while the use of the split-key, dual-escrowed \nsystem may prove to be a reasonable balance between privacy and \nlaw enforcement needs, the details of this scheme must be explored \npublicly before it is adopted.  What will give people confidence in the \nsafety of their keys?  Does disclosure of keys to a third party waive \nindividual's fifth amendment rights in subsequent criminal \ninquiries?  \n\n       In sum, the Administration has shown great sensitivity to the \nimportance of these issues by planning a comprehensive inquiry into \ndigital privacy and security.  However, the \"Clipper chip\" solution \nought to be considered as part of the inquiry, not be adopted before \nthe discussion even begins.\n\nDETAILS OF THE PROPOSAL:\n\nESCROW\n\nThe 80-bit key will be divided between two escrow agents, each of \nwhom hold 40 bits of each key.  Upon presentation of a valid \nwarrant, the two escrow agents would have to turn the key parts \nover to law enforcement agents.  Most likely the Attorney General \nwill be asked to identify appropriate escrow agents.  Some in the \nAdministration have suggested one non-law enforcement federal \nagency, perhaps the Federal Reserve, and one non-governmental \norganization.  But, there is no agreement on the identity of the agents \nyet.\n\nKey registration would be done by the manufacturer of the \ncommunications device.  A key is tied to the device, not to the person \nusing it.\n\nCLASSIFIED ALGORITHM AND THE POSSIBILITY OF BACK DOORS\n\nThe Administration claims that there are no back door means by \nwhich the government or others could break the code without \nsecuring keys from the escrow agents and that the President will \nbe told there are no back doors to this classified algorithm.  In order \nto prove this, Administration sources are interested in arranging for \nan all-star crypto cracker team to come in, under a security \narrangement, and examine the algorithm for trap doors.  The results \nof the investigation would then be made public.\n\nGOVERNMENT AS MARKET DRIVER\n\nIn order to get a market moving, and to show that the government \nbelieves in the security of this system, the feds will be the first big \ncustomers for this product.  Users will include the FBI, Secret Service, \nVP Al Gore, and maybe even the President. \n\nFROM MORE INFORMATION CONTACT:\n\nJerry Berman, Executive Director\nDaniel J.

Where can I get a WYSIWYG interface builder?\n\n\tA new release of the DIRT interface builder by Richard Hesketh works \nwith X11R5 and includes some support for the Motif widget set. From the README:\n  This builder allows the interactive creation and rapid prototyping of X user\n  interfaces using the X Toolkit and a number of Widget Sets.  Dirt generates\n  \"Wc - Widget Creation\" resource files and this distribution also includes the\n  Widget Creation Library (version 1.06, with the exception of the demos and\n  Mri/Ari source code) with the kind permission of its author David E. Smyth.\nCheck dirt.README, dirt.A2.0.tar.Z, and dirt.PS.Z on export.lcs.mit.edu.\n\n\tThe InterViews 3.0.1 C++ toolkit contains a WYSIWIG interface builder \ncalled ibuild. ibuild generates code for an InterViews application complete \nwith Imakefile and an X-resource file. Documentation is /pub/papers/ibuild.ps \non interviews.stanford.edu (36.22.0.175).\n\tQuest Windows's (408-496-1900) ObjectViews C++ package includes an\ninteractive building tool. \n\n\tDruid (Demonstrational Rapid User Interface Development) runs on SPARC \nmachines using OSF/Motif 1.0; it is intended eventually to be a full UIMS but \napparently now has only support for creating the presentation components, for \nwhich it generates C/UIL code.

Affected programs include rgb and \nthe server.\n\n\tThis is from the GCC manual:\n\n\tOn the Sparc, GNU CC uses an incompatible calling convention for \n\tstructures.  It passes them by including their contents in the argument\n\tlist, whereas the standard compiler passes them effectively by \n\treference.\n\n\tThis really ought to be fixed, but such calling conventions are not yet\n\tsupported in GNU CC, so it isn't straightforward to fix it.\n\n\tThe convention for structure returning is also incompatible, and\n\t`-fpcc-struct-return' does not help.\n\nYou can duck the problem either by using cc throughout or by using it for just\nthe routines which cause incompatibilities; the problem cannot be solved with \ncompilation flags.  \n\n\tFiles which need to be compiled using cc include:\n\t\tserver/os/4.2bsd/oscolor.c \n\t\trgb/rgb.c\n\n\tIn addition, several of the \"inet_\" functions use structs as args or\nreturn values:  \n\t\tclients/xhost/xhost.c \n\t\tclients/xauth/gethost.c. \nCalls to inet_addr in /lib/CLX/socket.c and lib/X/XConnDis.c are possibly \nharmless as they don't involve structs.\n\n[collected by bashford@scripps.edu (Don Bashford); 8/90]\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject:  98)  What are these I/O errors running X built with gcc?\nWhen I try to run xinit or the Xsun server I get the error \n\t\"Getting interface configuration: Operation not supported on socket. \n\tFatal server bug! no screens found.\"\n\n\tRunning the gcc fixincludes script apparently didn't work. You can do \nthis simple test:\n\n\t#include <sys/ioctl.h>\n\tSIOCGIFCONF\n\nRun that through cc -E and gcc -E.  The last line of output is the piece of \ninterest; it should be identical (modulo irrelevant differences like \nwhitespace).  If the gcc version has 'x' where the cc version has 'i', your \nfixincludes run didn't work for some reason or other; go back to your gcc\nsources and run `fixincludes`; then rebuild the X distribution. If they are \nidentical, try running a make clean in mit/server and rebuilding, just to make \nsure everything gets compiled with the proper include files.  \n\n[courtesy der Mouse, mouse@LARRY.MCRCIM.MCGILL.EDU; 9/90]\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject:  99)  What are these problems compiling X11R4 on the older Sun3?\nIn mit/server/ddx/sun/sunCG3C.c, we have found \"missing\" defines for \nCG3AC_MONOLEN, CG3BC_MONOLEN, CG3AC_ENBLEN, CG3BC_ENBLEN.

While \nbuilding and installing the distribution, you need to be careful to avoid \nlinking against any existing X shared libraries you might have (e.g. those \ndistributed with OpenWindows).  You should make sure you do not have \nLD_LIBRARY_PATH set in your environment during the build or the installation.  \nIf you are going to keep xterm and xload as setuid programs, please note that \nthe shared libraries must be installed in /usr/lib, /usr/local/lib, or \n/usr/5lib for these programs to work (or else those programs must be linked \nstatically). [courtesy MIT X Consortium]\n\tNote also that the program mkfontdir is run as part of the build; it\nattempts, however, to use the shared libraries before they have been installed.\nYou can avoid the errors by building mkfontdir statically (pass -Bstatic to\nmost C compilers).\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject: 102)  Can OLIT programs run with R5 Xt?

It wasn't documented and was \nremoved in X11R5 (MIT's guarantee of upward compatibility between the R4 and R5\nlibraries only applied to the documented interface).  \n\nA workaround is to temporarily set your LD_LIBRARY_PATH to point to the X11R4\nor OpenWindows Xt library that you linked the program against.\n\n[10/92; from Barry Margolin (barmar@think.com); 3/93 from Jeff Francis \n(jpf@heliocentric.com)]\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject: 103)  How do I get around the SunOS 4.1 security hole?\n\n\tThere is a security problem with certain R4 clients (xterm and xload)\nrunning under SunOS 4.1 that have been installed setuid root and are using \nshared libraries; to avoid the problem, do one of these:\n\t1) make the program non-setuid. You should consult your system\nadministrator concerning protection of resources (e.g. ptys and /dev/kmem) used\nby these programs, to make sure that you do not create additional security \nproblems at your site.\n\t2) relink the programs statically (using -Bstatic).\n\t3) install the libraries before linking and link with absolute paths\nto the libraries.\n\n[from rws@expo.lcs.mit.edu (Bob Scheifler), 12/90]\n\nThe R5 version of xterm does this automatically by rebuilding xterm against the\nnewly-installed libraries when xterm is being installed; this prevents an suid\nprogram from being built with libraries specified relatively. Note that this \nmay cause an inconvenience when doing the installation from NFS-mounted disks. \nXload has been rewritten to avoid the problem.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject: 104)  How do I get around the frame-buffer security hole?\n\n\tOn many systems the frame-buffer is unsecured by default; this permits \nanyone who can log into your workstation to peek at your windowing session by \naccessing the frame-buffer directly, or, as less of a privacy issue but perhaps\nmore annoying, to [accidentally] start up a second X session on your console \ndisplay.

Although it is not \nspecific to X, the X release uses it to help solve a number of the \nconfiguration issues that arise in making such a large system widely portable.\n\tImake has a fairly steep learning curve, in part because the process by\nwhich the system-specific configuration files, system-independent configuration\nfiles, and individual Imakefiles are melded to produce a Makefile is not \nobvious.\n\tThere have been several different versions of imake; the R3, R4, and\nR5 versions are different.\n\n\tYou can obtain information on imake from these sources:\n\t- the R4 and R5 release notes and imake man page include information on\nusing Imake to build X\n\t- the R4 and R5 file mit/config/README also contains useful information\n\t- on the R4 tapes, contrib/doc/imake/imake.tex is Mark Moraes' R3/R4\nguide to imake.\n\t- the R5 mit/doc/config/usenixws/paper.ms contains a paper by Jim\nFulton on an early version of Imake\n\t- Paul Dubois (dubois@primate.wisc.edu) has written a useful \nexplanation of how Imake works and how to use it in configuring X for non-\nsupported systems; the document is available from ftp.primate.wisc.edu\nin the directory ~ftp/pub/imake-stuff; look for config-X11R4.ms (troff) and \nconfig-X11R4.ps (PostScript). Some supplemental appendices are nearby. \n[7/91: document version is now 1.06] These imake papers are available by email;\nmail a message body of \"send imake-stuff help\" to almanac@primate.wisc.edu.\n\t- see \"System Administration - Imake: Friend of Foe?\" by Dinah McNutt\nin the November 1991 issue of SunExpert.\n\t- German readers should expect in June 1992 an article \"Das Meta-Make \n/ I make, you make / Schwerelos\" by Rainer Klute in \"iX \nMultiuser-Multitasking-Magazin\", directed at application programmers needing to\nwrite Imakefiles. An English-language derivative of this article is in The\nX Journal, issue 2:1.\n\t- The O'Reilly X Resource issue #2 contains Paul Davey's article on\ndemystifying Imake.\n\t- Alain Brossard's working document full of tips on Imake is in \nsasun1.epfl.ch:pub/imakefile.1.Z.\n\n[1/91;12/91;5/92;8/92]\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject: 107)  Where can I get imake?\n\n\tVersions are distributed with the R4 and R5 releases. An earlier \nversion is distributed with the X11R3 release; some third-party toolkits \nredistribute versions of imake along with their own implementations of the \ntemplate and configuration files. There are no real standards for such \nconfiguration files, although most *current* contributed software expects the \ntemplates distributed with X11R5.\n\texport contains the R5 distribution unpacked, so you can pick up imake\nwithout picking up the entire distribution.\n\tA stand-alone version of Imake, but one stemming from X11R5, is in\nftp.germany.eu.net:pub/X11/misc/imake/imake-pure.tar.Z (192.76.144.75).\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject: 108)  I have a program with an Imakefile but no Makefile. What to do?\n\n\tIf you have R4 or R5 installed on your system, run \"xmkmf\". This is a \nscript which runs imake for you with the correct arguments. The output is a \nMakefile configured for your system and based on the Imakefile. Then run make, \nwhich will use that new Makefile to compile the program.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject: 109)  Why can't I link to the Xlib shape routines?\nWhen I try to compile certain programs, I get the following link error:\n\tUndefined:\n\t_XShapeQueryExtension\n\t_XShapeCombineMask\n\n\tThese routines are actually part of the Shape Extension to X (SHAPE)\nwhich was introduced in the MIT X11R4 distribution and allows non-rectangular\nwindows.  Like the other sample server extensions, the shape extension will \nonly run on a server which supports it.  Pre-X11R4 servers, as well as many \nvendor-supplied servers, do not support the shape extension, in which case \nthey will display rectangular windows anyway.\n\n\tIn order to use the shape extension, you must link to the library \nlibXext.a.  In the X11R4 distribution, this library and the associated includes\nwill be in the mit/extensions directory.  If you do not have these files, do \nnot despair:  many freeware programs which use the shape extension can also be \ncompiled without it by removing the -DSHAPE define from the Makefile; you can\nprobably do this and compile successfully against your older vendor-supplied X \nlibraries.\n\n[from John B. Melby, melby%yk.fujitsu.co.jp@uunet.uu.net, 3/91]\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject: 110)  What are these problems with \"_XtInherit not found\" on the Sun?\nWhen I run a X program that I wrote on a SunOS 4.0.3 or 4.1 machine I get the \nerror \"ld.so: symbol not found _XtInherit\".\n\n\tWhat you are seeing is a side-effect of a kludge in the R4 libXt.a to \nget Sun shared libraries working.  Apparently, you can't share a function that \nis both called and compared, as _XtInherit is. This was handled by putting \n_XtInherit in the same file as a function that is always used, thereby \nguaranteeing that it would be loaded -- that is, in Initialize.c, where \nXtToolkitInitialize() and XtInitialize() reside. These routines would normally\nbe called.\n\n\tYou are probably seeing this error because your program is not a normal\nXt-based program and does not call XtToolkitInitialize() anywhere. \n\t1) it may be a program that uses Xt functions but never opens a \nconnection to the X server.  [OSF/Motif's 1.1.0 UIL had this problem; it called\nXtMalloc() and other Xt functions.] The solution is to add the call to your \nprogram; the function does not have to be executed, just linked in.\n\t2) alternatively, your program doesn't need any Xt functions and is\ncorrect in not calling XtToolkitInitialize() -- it may be an Xlib or XView \nprogram. In this case, you can remove -lXt from your link command. \n\n\tIt should not be necessary to link the shared libraries statically,\nalthough this will certainly solve the problem.\n\t\n[from Jordan Hayes (now jordan@MooreNet.COM) and Danny Backx (db@sunbim.be); \n11/90]\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject: 111)  Why can't I compile my R3 Xaw contrib programs under the new X?\nI have a program that worked well under X11R3. When I try to link it under \nthe current version of X, I get this message:\n\tUndefined:\n\t_XtScrollBarSetThumb\n\t_XtTextSetInsertionPoint\n\t_XtTextReplace\n\n\tThere were several name changes in the Athena widget set (in addition\nto the header files moving into <X11/Xaw/>); these are mentioned in the R4\nrelease notes. In this case, these functions are not really Xt functions but\nare part of the Xaw text widget and so have been renamed from Xt* to Xaw*.\n[10/90]\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject: 112)  TOPIC: PROGRAMMING PROBLEMS AND PUZZLES\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject: 113)  Why doesn't my program get the keystrokes I select for (sic)?\n\n\tThe window manager controls how the input focus is transferred from one\nwindow to another.  In order to get keystrokes, your program must ask the\nwindow manager for the input focus.  To do this, you must set up what are\ncalled \"hints\" for the window manager.  If your applications is Xlib-based, you\ncan use something like the following:\n\n        XWMHints wmhints;\n        ...\n        wmhints.flags = InputHint;\n        wmhints.input = True;\n        XSetWMHints(dpy, window, &wmhints)\n\nIf your application is based on the Xt Intrinsics, you can set the XtNinput \nresource to be True (as you probably want to in any case); if you don't have\nsource, you can start up the application with the resource '*input:True'.\n\nCertain window managers, notably dxwm and olwm, are very picky about having \nthis done. \n\n\tIf you are using Sun's OpenWindows olwm, you can also add this resource\nto your defaults file to use clients that aren't ICCCM-compliant.\n\tOpenWindows.FocusLenience:       true\n\n[mostly courtesy Dave Lemke of NCD and Stuart Marks of Sun]\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject: 114)  How do I figure out what window manager is running?\n\n\tYou can't reliably tell; whatever mechanism you could use could be\nspoofed in any case. \n\tFor most cases, you shouldn't care which window manager is running, so \nlong as you do things in an ICCCM-conformant manner. There are some cases in \nwhich particular window managers are known to do things wrong; checking for\nparticular hints placed on the window by the window manager so that you can \nsidestep the problem may be appropriate in these cases. Alternatively, it may \nbe appropriate to determine which window manager is running in order to take\nadvantage of specific *added* features (such as olwm's push-pin menus) in order\nto give your program *added* functionality. Beware of usurping the window \nmanager's functions by providing that functionality even when it is missing;\nthis surely leads to future compatibility problems.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject: 115)  Is there a skeleton X program available?\n\t\n\tThere is no general framework such as the TransSkel program for the \nMacintosh which handles lots of the odds and ends and overhead of development \nunder a window system and which can be used as a platform for additional \ndevelopment. In X, the problem is typically solved by using an interactive \napplication builder tool or by using cut&paste on existing X applications. Good\napplications which you might look to manipulate when you want to \"test just \nthis one little thing\" include contrib/clients/xskel, a simple R4 program that \nputs up a window and allows sketching in it and offers a starting point for\nquick hacks, the Xaw examples in the examples/ directory in the R3 and R4 \ndistributions, and the Xlib \"Hello World\" example in the R3 doc/HelloWorld and \nR4 doc/tutorials/HelloWorld; an updated version of this program which uses R4 \nXlib calls and current ICCCM conventions was posted in 2/90 to comp.windows.x  \nby Glenn Widener of Tektronix. \t[3/90]\n\n\tIn addition, a sample Xt program (for Xaw or Xm) by Rainer Klute \nshowing how to open multiple displays and how to catch a broken display \nconnection is available on export.lcs.mit.edu in contrib/mdisp.tar.Z. [4/92]\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject: 116)  Why does XtGetValues not work for me (sic)?\n\n\tThe XtGetValues interface for retrieving resources from a widget is\nsensitive to the type of variable. Your code may be doing something like this:\n\t{\n\tArg args[3];\n\tint i;\n\tint sensitive;\t\t/* oops; wrong data type */\n\ti=0;\n\tXtSetArg (args[i], XtNsensitive, &sensitive); i++;\n\tXtGetValues(widget, args, i );\n\t...\n\t}\n\nBut XtNsensitive is a Boolean, which on most machines is a single byte; \ndeclaring the variable \"sensitive\" as Boolean works properly. This problem \ncomes up often when using particular toolkits that redefine the Xt types \nDimension and Position; code that assumes they are int will have similar \nproblems if those types are actually short. In general: you are safe if you\nuse the actual type of the resource, as it appears in the widget's man page.\n[11/90]\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject: 117)  Why don't XtConfigureWidget/XtResizeWidget/XtMoveWidget work?\n\n\tYou're probably trying to use these functions from application code.\nThey should be used only internally to widgets; these functions are for a \nparent widget to change the geometry of its children. Other promising \nfunctions, XtMakeGeometryRequest() and XtMakeResizeRequest(), are also for use \nonly by widgets, in this case by a child to request a change from its parent.\n\tThe only way for your application to request a geometry change for a\nwidget is to issue an XtSetValues call setting some of the geometry resources.\nAlthough this will result in the widget-internal functions' being called, your\napplication code must use the standard XtSetValues interface or risk the \nwidgets' data becoming corrupted.\n\t[The Xlib calls XMoveWindow() and XResizeWindow() should similarly be \navoided; they shouldn't be used to change XtNx, XtNy, XtNwidth, or XtNheight.]\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject: 118)  Why isn't there an XtReparentWidget call like XReparentWindow?\n\n\tAlthough there are various details of the current implementation of\nthe Xt internals which make reparenting difficult, the major reason that no\nsuch call exists is that it remains undefined what the set of resources for\nthe \"new\" widget should be.

I\nasked them why, and all I got was \"Your point is well taken, but\nOrchid's software developers are busy with other projects.\"\n\n\tSo, to get to the point, finally, ARE there any s3 86c805\ndrivers out there that can handle high res hicolor modes?  I'd love to\nget another card, but perhaps it will have to wait until the next\ngeneration of cards comes out, since this card came bundled with my\nsystem and it's not so easy to exchange these things unless they're\nbroken.\n\n\tIf you want these modes, steer away from Orchids s3 86c805\ncards (ie. VLB or VA/VLB), at least until their developers are \"less\nbusy\".  If the magazines are to believed, I've only seen one s3 86c805\nproduct thus far which can handle 1024x768x32k color (Genoa?),\nalthough evenn that might be a misprint.\n\n\tPlease, if there are generic or semi-generic drivers out\nthere, let me know where I can get them.  800x600x32k is OK, but I\ncoulda gotten that with my ATI VGA Wonder XL.","label":"comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware"}

{"text":"Classify the following data: Note:     The following was released by the White House today in\n          conjunction with the announcement of the Clipper Chip\n          encryption technology.\n\n                           FACT SHEET\n\n                  PUBLIC ENCRYPTION MANAGEMENT\n\nThe President has approved a directive on \"Public Encryption\nManagement.\"  The directive provides for the following:\n\nAdvanced telecommunications and commercially available encryption\nare part of a wave of new computer and communications technology. \nEncryption products scramble information to protect the privacy of\ncommunications and data by preventing unauthorized access. \nAdvanced telecommunications systems use digital technology to\nrapidly and precisely handle a high volume of communications. \nThese advanced telecommunications systems are integral to the\ninfrastructure needed to ensure economic competitiveness in the\ninformation age.\n\nDespite its benefits, new communications technology can also\nfrustrate lawful government electronic surveillance.  Sophisticated\nencryption can have this effect in the United States.  When\nexported abroad, it can be used to thwart foreign intelligence\nactivities critical to our national interests.  In the past, it has\nbeen possible to preserve a government capability to conduct\nelectronic surveillance in furtherance of legitimate law\nenforcement and national security interests, while at the same time\nprotecting the privacy and civil liberties of all citizens.  As\nencryption technology improves, doing so will require new,\ninnovative approaches.\n\nIn the area of communications encryption, the U. S. Government has\ndeveloped a microcircuit that not only provides privacy through\nencryption that is substantially more robust than the current\ngovernment standard, but also permits escrowing of the keys needed\nto unlock the encryption.  The system for the escrowing of keys\nwill allow the government to gain access to encrypted information\nonly with appropriate legal authorization.\n\nTo assist law enforcement and other government agencies to collect\nand decrypt, under legal authority, electronically transmitted\ninformation, I hereby direct the following action to be taken:\n\nINSTALLATION OF GOVERNMENT-DEVELOPED MICROCIRCUITS\n\nThe Attorney General of the United States, or her representative,\nshall request manufacturers of communications hardware which\nincorporates encryption to install the U.S. government-developed\nkey-escrow microcircuits in their products.  The fact of law\nenforcement access to the escrowed keys will not be concealed from\nthe American public.  All appropriate steps shall be taken to\nensure that any existing or future versions of the key-escrow\nmicrocircuit are made widely available to U.S. communications\nhardware manufacturers, consistent with the need to ensure the\nsecurity of the key-escrow system.  In making this decision, I do\nnot intend to prevent the private sector from developing, or the\ngovernment from approving, other microcircuits or algorithms that\nare equally effective in assuring both privacy and a secure key-\nescrow system.\n\nKEY-ESCROW\n\nThe Attorney General shall make all arrangements with appropriate\nentities to hold the keys for the key-escrow microcircuits\ninstalled in communications equipment.  In each case, the key\nholder must agree to strict security procedures to prevent\nunauthorized release of the keys.  The keys shall be released only\nto government agencies that have established their authority to\nacquire the content of those communications that have been\nencrypted by devices containing the microcircuits.  The Attorney\nGeneral shall review for legal sufficiency the procedures by which\nan agency establishes its authority to acquire the content of such\ncommunications.\n\nPROCUREMENT AND USE OF ENCRYPTION DEVICES\n\nThe Secretary of Commerce, in consultation with other appropriate\nU.S. agencies, shall initiate a process to write standards to\nfacilitate the procurement and use of encryption devices fitted\nwith key-escrow microcircuits in federal communications systems\nthat process sensitive but unclassified information.  I expect this\nprocess to proceed on a schedule that will permit promulgation of\na final standard within six months of this directive. ","label":"sci.crypt"}
{"text":"Classify the following data: {I sent in something on this before but I believe it got lost in the\nweekend accident the moderator described.  This is an improved\nversion anyway so no loss the first time.  HL}\n\nThe standard work on detecting forgeries of ancient documents \nis probably the writing of Friedrich Blass, \"Hermeneutrik und \nKritik,\" _Einleitende und Hilfsdisziplinen_, vol 1 of\n_Handbuch der Klassischen Altertums- wissenshaft_ (Noerdlingen:\nBeck, 1886).  Portions of this are described in Nibley, _The \nProphetic Book op Mormon_, pp 219-242 (SLC:  Deseret Book, 1989).\n(If you want to attempt reading this be forewarned.  Nibley\ndescribes Blass as a typical German scholar who claims little\nknowledge of his subject, then proceeds to exhaust both the subject\nand the reader.)  Nibley's extract from Blass's work is in the form\nof \"rules for forgers.\"  It makes interesting reading.\n\nI confess that I have not read Blass's work, only Nibley's extract\nthereof.  My German falls far short of what would be required and\nas far as I know there is no English translation available.  However,\nI believe the techniques he describes are known widely enough that \nany competent classical scholar could examine a purportedly ancient\ndocument and at least determine if it is consistent with what one \nwould expect of a genuine document of that time frame.  We will not \nbe able to prove who wrote it but at least we should be able to \ndetermine with reasonable confidence if it is from that time and \nculture or is a later forgery.\n\nActually there are 2 types of purportedly ancient documents:\n\n1.  Alleged actual holographs or early copies thereof.  For example\nthe Dead Sea Scrolls.  These can be tested by various scientific\nmeans to determine the age of the paper, inks, and objects found\nwith them.  This can provide a pretty clear dating of the actual\nphysical objects.\n\n2.  Documents claiming to be copies of ancient works although the\ncopy itself may be much more recent.  For example we might find a\ndocument which monks in a monastary claim is a copy of something\nfrom centuries ago (perhaps even having been through several\ngenerations of copists).  This is more of a problem but can still \nbe tested (although the test is not likely to be simple).  We cannot\nexpect a test of the age of the physical objects to tell us much so\nwe must confine our testing to the text itself.\n\nIt is important to remember that none of these tests can tell us if\nthe document is really what it claims to be.  They can only date the\ndocument and identify its culture of origin.  For example I've heard\nof a letter supposed to have been written by Jesus himself to a king\nin what is now Iraq.  If this document were to actually turn up\nscholars could date the paper and ink (assuming they have the\nholograph).  They could check the language, content and writing\nstyle to see if they are consistent with what would be expected of a\nPalestinian Jew of that time.  However even if all test results were\npositive there is no way to determine if Jesus himself actually\nwrote it.  We would know what time and culture it came from but\n(barring a known sample of Jesus handwriting or other clues for \ncomparison) scholarship must stop there.  There is seldom any way to\ndetermine who the actual author was.\n\nAs I say, I'm no expert on Blas's work.  I do remember some of the\ntests which can be applied to alleged copies of ancient works.  \nSpecifically we might ask:\n\n1.  Is the document internally consistent?  Does it contradict\nitself?  If the work it is short it would be relatively easy to \nmaintain internal consistency, even if it is a forgery.  The \nlonger the forgery the more difficult it is to maintain consistency.\nFor this reason most successful forgers stick to short documents.\n\n2.  Is it consistent with the history and geography of the time?\nAgain a short, non-specific work might not be testable but if the\nwriting is of any significant length no latter-day forger would be\nable to escape detection.  Here we look for the minor, inconspicuous\nthings which someone from that culture would get right without even\nthinking about it but which a later forger would find too numerous \nand trivial to check.  The devil is in the details.\n\n3.  What about the literary style of the work, figures of speech\netc.  Any ancient writer would almost certainly speak in ways that \nseem strange to us.  Are there any such odd phrases in this book?  \nIf so do they fit in with the culture?\n\nOf course there are complications if the document has been\ntranslated, or possibly even if somebody just updated language\nwhen he copied it.  A few cases of language not from the culture\nclaimed may be allowed in recent copies.  They cause problems and\nreduce certainty to be sure but don't necessarily prove forgery.\n\nThese tests can be quite effective (given enough material to work \nwith) but they are not easy.  They require the skills of the \nhistorian, the linguist, the anthropologist etc.  The questions to \nask are, \"Is every aspect of this document consistent with what we \nknow about the culture of claimed origin?\"  If there are things \nwhich don't fit how significant are they?  Are problem areas due to\nour lack of knowledge, later changes by copists or are they really \nsignificant?  There will often be some ambiguity since we never\nknow everything about the culture.","label":"soc.religion.christian"}

Xt Glossary\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\no The Xt Intrinsics implement an object oriented interface to C code\n  to allow useful graphical components to be created.  Included with\n  this are classes that provide the base functionality: Object,\n  RectObj, Core, Composite, Constraint, Shell, OverrideShell, WMShell,\n  etc.  The terms \"Xt\" and \"Intrinsics\" are used interchangeably,\n  however, they are used very precisely to mean a specific library of the X\n  window system.  In particular, it does not include the Athena,\n  Motif, OLIT or any other widget set.  Without further widgets the\n  Intrinsics are not especially useful.\n\no A widget refers to a user interface abstraction created via Xt.  The\n  precise use, is any object that is a subclass of the Core class.  It\n  is used loosely to refer to anything that is a subclass of the\n  Object class although these are more accurately called windowless\n  widgets or gadgets.\n\no Xlib is the C interface to the X11 protocol.  It is one layer below\n  the Xt Intrinsics.  Typically a widget uses relatively few Xlib\n  functions because Xt provides most such services although an\n  understanding of Xlib helps with problems.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n1.

Related FAQ's\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nDavid B. Lewis (uunet!craft!faq) maintains the FAQ on X.  It\nis posted monthly on comp.windows.x and located on export in contrib/FAQ.\n\nLiam R. E. Quin (lee@sq.sq.com) posts an FAQ list on Open Look to \ncomp.windows.x.  \n\nJan Newmarch (jan@pandonia.canberra.edu.au) posts an FAQ list on Motif \nto comp.windows.x.motif.\n\nPeter Ware (ware@cis.ohio-state.edu) posts an FAQ list for\ncomp.windows.x.intrinsics; it is on export in contrib/FAQ-Xt.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n3.  Why does my application core dump when I use signals/alarms/cthreads?\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIn brief, Xlib, Xt and most widget sets have no mutual exclusion for\ncritical sections.  Any interrupt handler is likely to leave one of\nthe above libraries in an inconsistent state -- such as all the\nappropriate flags not yet set, dangling pointers, in the middle of a\nlist traversal, etc.  Note that the ANSI C standard points out that\nbehavior of a signal handler is undefined if the signal handler calls\nany function other than signal() itself, so this is not a problem\nspecific to Xlib and Xt; the POSIX specification mentions other\nfunctions which may be called safely but it may not be assumed that\nthese functions are called by Xlib or Xt functions.\n\nThe only safe way to deal with signals is to set a flag in the\ninterrupt handler.  This flag later needs to be checked either by a\nwork procedure or a timeout callback.  It is incorrect to add either\nof these in the interrupt handler.  As another note, it is dangerous\nto add a work procedure that never finishes.  This effectively\npreempts any work procedures previously added and so they will never\nbe called.  Another option is to open a pipe, tell the event loop\nabout the read end using XtAppAddInput() and then the signal handler\ncan write a byte to the write end of the pipe for each signal.\nHowever, this could deadlock your process if the pipe fills up.\n\nWhy don't the Intrinsics deal with this problem?  Primarily because it\nis supposed to be a portable layer to any hardware and operating\nsystem.   Is that a good enough reason -- I don't think so.\n\n        Note: the article in The X Journal 1:4 and the example in O'Reilly\nVolume 6 are in error.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n4.  How do I use a different visual than the default?\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThis requires a more complicated answer than it should.  A window has\nthree things that are visual specific -- the visual, colormap and\nborder pixmap.  All widgets have their own Colormap and BorderPixmap\nresource; only shell widgets have Visual resources (another questions\ndeals with why shells have a Visual).  The default value of these\nresources is CopyFromParent which does exactly what it says.  In the\nshell widget CopyFromParent gets evalulated as DefaultVisualOfScreen\nand DefaultColormapOfScreen.  When any one of the three resources is\nnot properly set, a BadMatch error occurs when the window is\ncreated.  They are not properly set because each of the values depends\non the visual being used.  \n\nHow to get this to work?  There are two parts to the answer.  The\nfirst is if you want an application to start with a particular visual\nand the second is if you want a particular shell within an application\nto start with a different visual.  The second is actually easier\nbecause the basic information you need is available.  The first is a\nlittle harder because you'll need to initialize much of the toolkit\nyourself in order to determine the needed information.\n\n/*\n * Some sample code to start up an application using something other\n * than the default visual.\n *\n * To compile:\n *\tcc -g visual.c -o visual -lXaw -lXmu -lXt -lXext -lX11 -lm\n *\n * To run:\n *\t./visual -geometry 300x300 -depth 24 -visual StaticColor -fg blue -bg yellow\n *\n * you need to move the mouse to get the particular visuals colormap\n * to install.\n */\n\n#include <X11/Intrinsic.h>\n#include <X11/StringDefs.h>\n#include <X11/Shell.h>\n\ntypedef struct\n{\n\tVisual\t*visual;\n\tint\tdepth;\n} OptionsRec;\n\nOptionsRec\tOptions;\n\nXtResource resources[] =\n{\n\t{\"visual\", \"Visual\", XtRVisual, sizeof (Visual *),\n\tXtOffsetOf (OptionsRec, visual), XtRImmediate, NULL},\n\t{\"depth\", \"Depth\", XtRInt, sizeof (int),\n\tXtOffsetOf (OptionsRec, depth), XtRImmediate, NULL},\n};\n\nXrmOptionDescRec Desc[] =\n{\n\t{\"-visual\", \"*visual\", XrmoptionSepArg, NULL},\n\t{\"-depth\", \"*depth\", XrmoptionSepArg, NULL}\n};\n\n\n\nint\nmain (argc, argv)\n\tint\t\targc;\n\tchar\t\t**argv;\n{\n\tXtAppContext\tapp;\t\t/* the application context */\n\tWidget\t\ttop;\t\t/* toplevel widget */\n\tDisplay\t\t*dpy;\t\t/* display */\n\tchar\t\t**xargv;\t/* saved argument vector */\n\tint\t\txargc;\t\t/* saved argument count */\n\tColormap\tcolormap;\t/* created colormap */\n\tXVisualInfo\tvinfo;\t\t/* template for find visual */\n\tXVisualInfo\t*vinfo_list;\t/* returned list of visuals */\n\tint\t\tcount;\t\t/* number of matchs (only 1?) */\n\tArg\t\targs[10];\n\tCardinal\tcnt;\n\tchar\t\t*name = \"test\";\n\tchar\t\t*class = \"Test\";\n\n\t/*\n\t * save the command line arguments\n\t */\n\n\txargc = argc;\n\txargv = (char **) XtMalloc (argc * sizeof (char *));\n\tbcopy ((char *) argv, (char *) xargv, argc * sizeof (char *));\n\n\t/*\n\t * The following creates a _dummy_ toplevel widget so we can\n\t * retrieve the appropriate visual resource.\n\t */\n\tcnt = 0;\n\ttop = XtAppInitialize (&app, class, Desc, XtNumber (Desc), &argc, argv,\n\t\t\t       (String *) NULL, args, cnt);\n\tdpy = XtDisplay (top);\n\tcnt = 0;\n\tXtGetApplicationResources (top, &Options, resources,\n\t\t\t\t   XtNumber (resources),\n\t\t\t\t   args, cnt);\n\tcnt = 0;\n\tif (Options.visual && Options.visual != DefaultVisualOfScreen (XtScreen (top)))\n\t{\n\t\tXtSetArg (args[cnt], XtNvisual, Options.visual); ++cnt;\n\t\t/*\n\t\t * Now we create an appropriate colormap.

Which visual should an application use?\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThis is a point that can be argued about but one opinion is there is\nno way for an application to know the appropriate visual -- it has to\nbe specified by the user.  If you disagree with this then your\napplication probably falls into the category of always using the\ndefault visual or it is hardware specific and expects some particular\nvisual such as 24bit TrueColor with an OverlayPlane extension (or some\nsuch).\n\nWhy?  No application runs in isolation.  Depending on the way a server\nallocates resources I may not always want your application to run in\nTrueColor mode if it is going to mess up my other applications.  I may\nbe very upset if it chooses to run in GreyScale instead of PsuedoColor\nor just monochrome.\n\nAs an example, on a low end color Sun server there are many different\npossible visuals: monochrome, 256 entry colormap, static gray, static\ncolor, and a 3/3/2 TrueColor.  The SGI Iris's offer all the above \nplus 12 bit TrueColor, 24 bit TrueColor, an Overlay Plane.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n6.  Why do only Shell widgets have a Visual?\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThis is strictly by convention.  It makes it possible for an arbitrary\nwidget to know that the visual it uses can be found by looking for the\nshell widget that is its ancestor and obtaining the visual of that\nshell.\n\nA widget can have its own visual resource.  If it does, it must have\nits own realize method to use the visual when it calls\nXCreateWindow().  You should also make this a resource that can be\nobtained with XtGetValues() so other widgets can find it.  A\nreasonable value is probably XtNvisual.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n7.  Which visual, depth and colormap do Shells inherit?\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe default value for these resources are set to CopyFromParent.  This\nis interpreted as the DefaultColormapOfScreen(), DefaultDepthOfScreen()\nand the default visual of the screen if the widget has no parent -- i.e.\nit is an applicationShellWidgetClass and the root of your widget tree.\n\nIf the parent of the widget is not null, then the shell copies\ncolormap and depth from its parent and uses CopyFromParent as the\nvisual.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n8.  I've done all the above and I still get a BadMatch error.  Why?\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSome resource converters improperly cache references.  This was\nespecially true of X11R3 and earlier versions of Motif.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n9.  Why doesn't my widget get destroyed when I call XtDestroyWidget()?\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSee section 2.8 of the Xt specification.\n\nIt eventually does get destroyed, just not immediately.  The\nIntrinsics destroy a widget in a two-phase process.  First it and all\nof its children have a flag set that indicate it is being destroyed.\nIt is then put on a list of widgets to be destroyed.  This way any\npending X events or further references to that widget can be cleaned\nup before the memory is actually freed.  The second phase is then\nperformed after all callbacks, event handlers, and actions have\ncompleted, before checking for the next X event.  At this point the\nlist is traversed and each widget's memory is actually free()'d, among\nother things.\n\nAs some further caveats/trivia, the widgets may be destroyed if the\nIntrinsics determine that they have no further references to the\nwidgets on the list.  If so, then the phase 2 destruction occurs\nimmediately.  Also, if nested event loops are used, widgets placed on\nthe destroy list before entering the inner event loop are not\ndestroyed until returning to the outer event loop.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n10. How do I exit but still execute the DestroyCallbacks?\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe problem is if a simple and entirely reasonable approach to exiting\nan application is used, such as calling exit() directly, then a widget\nmay not have a chance to clean up any external state -- such as open\nsockets, temporary files, allocated X resources, etc.  (this code for\nsimplicity reasons assumes only a single toplevel widget):\n\n\n\tWidget\n\tToplevelGet (gw)\n\t\tWidget\t\tgw;\t\t/* widget to find toplevel */\n\t{\n\t\tWidget\t\ttop;\n\n\t\tfor (top = gw; XtParent (top); top = XtParent (top))\n\t\t\t/* empty */;\n\t\treturn (top);\n\t}\n\n\tvoid\n\tExitCallback (gw, closure, call_data)\n\t\tWidget\t\tgw;\t\t/* widget */\n\t\tXtPointer\tclosure;\t/* data the app specified */\n\t\tXtPointer\tcall_data;\t/* widget specific data */\n\t{\n\t\tWidget\t\ttoplevel;\n\n\t\ttoplevel = ToplevelGet (gw);\n\t\tXtUnmapWidget (toplevel);\t/* make it disappear quickly */\n\t\tXtDestroyWidget (toplevel);\n\t\texit (0);\n\t}\n\nOne can see that the above code exit's immediately after destroying\nthe toplevel widget.  The trouble is the phase 2 destruction may never\noccur.  \n\nThis works for most widgets and most applications but will not work\nfor those widgets that have any external state.  You might think that\nsince it works now it will always work but remember that part of the\nreason an object oriented approach is used is so one can be ignorant\nof the implementation details for each widget.  Which means that the\nwidget may change and someday require that some external state is\ncleaned up by the Destroy callbacks.\n\nOne alternative is to modify ExitCallback() to set a global flag and\nthen test for that flag in a private event loop.  However, private\nevent loops are frowned upon because it tends to encourage sloppy, and\ndifficult to maintain practices.\n\nTry the following code instead.\n\n\t#include <X11/Intrinsic.h>\n\n\textern Widget ToplevelGet (\n\t#if NeedFunctionPrototypes\n\t\tWidget\t\tgw\n\t#endif\n\t);\n\n\textern Boolean ExitWorkProc (\n\t#if NeedFunctionPrototypes\n\t\tXtPointer\tclosure\n\t#endif\n\t);\n\n\textern void ExitCallback (\n\t#if NeedFunctionPrototypes\n\t\tWidget\t\tgw,\n\t\tXtPointer\tclosure,\n\t\tXtPointer\tcall_data\n\t#endif\n\t);\n\n\tWidget\n\tToplevelGet (gw)\n\tWidget\t\tgw;\t\t/* widget to find toplevel */\n\t{\n\t\tWidget\t\ttop;\n\n\t\tfor (top = gw; XtParent (top); top = XtParent (top))\n\t\t\t/* empty */;\n\t\treturn (top);\n\t}\n\n\n\tvoid\n\tExitCallback (gw, closure, call_data)\n\tWidget\t\tgw;\t\t/* widget */\n\tXtPointer\tclosure;\t/* data the app specified */\n\tXtPointer\tcall_data;\t/* widget specific data */\n\t{\n\t\tWidget\t\ttoplevel;\n\n\t\ttoplevel = ToplevelGet (gw);\n\t\tXtUnmapWidget (toplevel);\t/* make it disappear quickly */\n\t\tXtDestroyWidget (toplevel);\n\t\tXtAppAddWorkProc (XtWidgetToApplicationContext (gw),\n\t\t\t\t  ExitWorkProc, (XtPointer) NULL);\n\t}\n\n\tBoolean\n\tExitWorkProc (closure)\n\t\tXtPointer\tclosure;\n\t{\n\t\texit (0);\n\t\t/*NOTREACHED*/\n\t}\n\n\nExitCallback() adds a work procedure that will get called when the\napplication is next idle -- which happens after all the events are\nprocessed and the destroy callbacks are executed.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n11. How do I resize a Shell widget?\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAfter it is realized, one doesn't resize a Shell widget.  The proper\nthing is to resize the currently managed child of the Shell widget\nusing XtSetValues().  The geometry change is then propagated to the\nShell which asks the window manager which may or may not allow the\nrequest.  However, the Shell must have the resource\nXtNallowShellResize set to True otherwise it will not even ask the\nwindow manager to grant the request and the Shell will not resize.\n\nTo change the position of a Shell, use XtSetValues() on the Shell, not\nthe child, and within the limits of the window manager it should be granted.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n12. Why can't XtAppAddInput() handle files?\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIt does, however Unix semantics for when I/O is ready for a file does\nnot fit most peoples' intuitive model.  In Unix terms a file\ndescriptor is ready for reading whenever the read() call would not\nblock, ignoring the setting of optional flags that indicate not to\nblock.  This works as expected for terminals, sockets and pipes.  For\na file the read() will always return but the return indicates an EOF\n-- i.e. no more data.  The result is the code in the Intrinsics always\ncalls the input handler because it always thinks something is about to\nbe read.  The culprit is the select() system call or on SYSV based\nOS's it is the poll() system call.\n\nHow to get around this on a Unix system?  The best approach is to use\nanother process to check for available input on the file.  Use a pipe\nto connect the application with this other process and pass the file\ndescriptor from the pipe to XtAppAddInput().  A suitable program on\nBSD systems is \"tail -f filename\".\n\nIt's rumored that select() on some systems is not _completely_\nreliable.  In particular:\n\n\t- IBM AIX 3.1: this is one where it would work for a while\n\t  (several thousand times) and then stop until some other\n\t  event woke it up. This seemed to be the result of a race\n\t  condition in the Kernel.  IBM claims to have a fix for this.\n\n\t- Pyramid, doesn't work at all.\n\n\t- Ultrix (and possibly others where pipes are implemented as\n\t  sockets), wasn't completely broken, but although the writing\n\t  side wrote in 512 byte blocks the reading side received it\n\t  all broken up as if it was being put into the pipe a byte at\n\t  a time.  You can waste a lot of time by reading small blocks\n\t  (get raound it by detecting the situation and having\n\t  select() ignore the pipe for 10 mseconds - by then it had\n\t  been given the whole block).\n\n\nNote that all the above descriptions used Unix terminology such as\nread(), file descriptor, pipes, etc.  This is an OS dependent area and\nmay not be identical on all systems.  However the Intrinsic designers\nfelt it was a common enough operation that it should be included with\npart of the toolkit.  Why they didn't also deal with signals at this\npoint I don't know.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n13. What good books and magazines are there on Xt?\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nI have a favorite that is the definitive reference.  To my perspective\nit offers a reasonable introduction but also goes into the full\ndetails of the Intrinsics.  When I started using it I was already\nfamiliar with Xt and the concepts behind it, so newcomers may or may\nnot find it useful.  I've always found it accurate and complete, which\nmeans its a 1000 pages.\n\nAsente, Paul J., and Swick, Ralph R., \"X Window System Toolkit, The\n\tComplete Programmer's Guide and Specification\", Digital Press,\n\t1990, ISBN 1-55558-051-3, order number EY-E757E-DP; and by\n\tPrentice-Hall, ISBN 0-13-972191-6. Also available through DEC\n\tDirect at 1-800-DIGITAL.\n\nThe other book I commonly recomend to novices is:\n\nYoung, Doug. \"The X Window System: Applications and Programming with\n\tXt (Motif Version),\" Prentice Hall, 1989 (ISBN 0-13-497074-8).\n\t(ISBN 0-13-972167-3)\n\nAnd of course O'Reilly has an entire series of manuals on X and Xt.\nO'Reilly ordering is 800-998-9938.  In particular, Volume 5 is an Xt\nreference done in manual page style.  The 3rd edition is extensively\noverhauled and goes far beyond the MIT manual pages.  I'm finding it\nvery useful.  In particular, the permutted index and references to\nother manual pages help a great deal in chasing down related\ninformation.\n\nI read two periodicals, \"The X Resource\" and the \"The X Journal\".\nThese are the only two dealing specifically with X.  \"The X Resource\"\nis published quarterly, by O'Reilly, with one of the issues being the\nMIT X Consortium Technical Conference Proceedings.  There is no\nadvertising.  I've found it informative with pretty good depth.  For\norders, call 1-800-998-9938, or email cathyr@ora.com.  For editorial\nmatters, email adrian@ora.com.  Table of contents are posted at\nmath.utah.edu in ~ftp/pub/tex/bib in TeX form and on ftp.uu.net in\n~ftp/published/oreilly/xresource in ASCII form.\n\n\n\"The X Journal\" is a bimonthly trade rag with lots of advertising.\nThe articles are informative and oriented toward a less technical\naudience.  I read it more to see what's going on then with an\nexpectation of learning a great deal (but remember, I represent a\nfairly small percentage of people).  Also, they have a pretty good\ncollection of people on the advisory board and as columnists.  Call\n(908) 563-9033.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n14. What Widgets are available?\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThere are three popular widget sets:\n\nAthena\t- The set provided with X11.  This is sufficient for most\n\t  purposes but is on the ugly side.  Recently, a 3d look is\n\t  available for ftp on export.lcs.mit.edu:/contrib/Xaw3d.tar.Z.\nMotif\t- From OSF available for a license fee and commonly shipped on\n\t  many workstation vendors platforms (almost everyone but\n\t  Sun).  It looks good and works well but personally I think\n\t  it is poorly implemented.\nOLIT\t- The Open Look Intrinsics Toolkit is a set of widgets\n\t  implementing Sun's Open Look specification.  Developed by\n\t  AT&T.  I've never used it so can't comment on its quality.\n\t  I've heard rumours that it is a pain to actually get.\n\nIn addition the following collection of widgets are also available:\n\nXtra\t- a library of widgets for sale from Graphical Software\n\t  Technology (310-328-9338).  It includes bar graph, stacked\n\t  bar graph, line graph, pie chart, xy plot, hypertext, help,\n\t  spreadsheet, and data entry form widgets.  I've never seen\n\t  them so I can't comment.\nFWF\t- The Free Widget Foundation is attempting to collect a set of\n\t  freely available widgets.  Included are a Pixmap editor,\n\t  FileDialog, and a few others.  The current set of widgets\n\t  can be obtained via anonymous ftp from the machine\n\t  a.cs.uiuc.edu (128.174.252.1) in the file pub/fwf.shar.Z.\nXcu\t- The Cornell University widgets from Gene Dykes.  One of the\n\t  early widget sets released.  Provides a nice appearance for\n\t  buttons and has a mini command language.  Probably not so\n\t  widely used.\nXs\t- The Sony widget set.  This was around during R3 days but\n\t  seemed to disappear.  It looked like it had promise.\nXw\t- The HP widgets.  The precursor to Motif.  Originally written\n\t  for R3 there exists diffs to get it to work under R4 & R5.\n\t  Again, a pretty good widget set but has more or less died.\n\t  The precursor to this was the Xray toolkit which was\n\t  originally implemented for X10R4 and apparently provided\n\t  much experience for the designers of Xt.\nXo\t- A widget set I'm working on.  It's still primitive but you\n\t  can give it a try in archive.cis.ohio-state.edu:pub/Xo/*\n\nThe following specialized widgets are also available:\n\nTbl\t- Implements a tabular layout of widgets.  Supports Motif\n\t  widgets as children.  Part of Wcl.\nPlots\t- The Athena Plotting widgets (not the Athena widgets).\n\t  Contact gnb@bby.oz.au or joe@Athena.MIT.EDU.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n15. What alternatives to the Intrinsics are there?\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\t__________________________________________\n\tName\t\tLanguage\tVendor\n\t__________________________________________\n\tXview\t\tC\t\tSun\n\tOI\t\tC++\t\tParcPlace\n\tInterviews\tC++\t\tStanford\n\tTcl/tk\t\tC\t\tsprite.berkeley.edu\n\t__________________________________________\n\n\nHowever much I like C and admire the skill in both designing and\nimplementing the Intrinsics, hopefully some alternative will develop\nin the next 3-5 years that uses an object oriented language.  Keep\nyour eyes open and expect some change about the same time a language\nother than C _starts_ gaining acceptance.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n16. How do I pass a float value to XtSetValues?\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFirst, what is going wrong is the structure for an Arg is (essentially)\n\ttypdef struct\n\t{\t\n\t    String\tname;\n\t    long\tvalue;\n\t} Arg;\n\nand the code:\n\tArg\targ;\n\n\tXtSetArg (arg, \"name\", 3.2)\n\nexpands to\n\tArg\targ;\n\n\targ.name = \"name\";\n\targ.value = 3.2;\n\nyou can see that with normal C type conversions, the arg.value\ngets the integer \"3\" instead of the floating point value \"3.2\".  When\nthe value is copied into the widget resource, the bit pattern is\nwildly different than that required for a floating point value.  So,\nhow to get around this?\n\nThe following macro is from the Athena widgets document and I am now\nrecomending it over the previous suggestions.\n\n#define XtSetFloatArg(arg, n, d) \\\n    if (sizeof(float) > sizeof(XtArgVal)) { \\\n        XtSetArg(arg, n, &(d)); \\\n    } else { \\\n        XtArgVal *ld = (XtArgVal *)&(d); \\\n        XtSetArg(arg, n, *ld); \\\n    }\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n17. How do I write a resource converter?\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nCourtesy of Rich Thomson (rthomson@dsd.es.com):\n\nThe following discussion of resource converters assumes R4 (or R5)\nIntrinsics.  Resource converters changed between R3 and R4 to allow\nfor destructors and caching of converted values.\n\nThere are several main types of resource converters:\n\n    string to data type\n    data type to string\n    data type to data type\n\ni) string to data type\n    Usually a string to data type converter has a fixed set of strings\n    that will be converted to data type values.  This is most often\n    used to map enumerated names to enumerated values:\n\n\tName\t\tValue\n\t\"True\"\t\t1\n\t\"False\"\t\t0\n\n    In this case, the string to data type converter needs to compare\n    the resource value to the list of fixed strings.  This is most\n    readily accomplished by the use of the \"quark\" mechanism of the\n    resource manager.  The resource value is turned into a quark,\n    which is a unique representation of the string that fits into a\n    single word.  Then the resource quark is compared against the\n    quarks for the fixed strings representing the enumerated values.\n\n    If there are many enumerated strings in the converter (or many\n    converters, each with a small number of enumeration strings), then\n    a global initialization routine might be used to turn all the\n    resource strings into quarks.  That way, the first time one of\n    these converters is used, the strings will be turned into quarks\n    and held in static variables for use in the next invocation of one\n    of the converters.\n\nii) data type to string\n    This type of converter is slightly easier than the string to data\n    type converters since the use of quarks isn't necessary.  Instead,\n    the data type value is simply converted to a string value,\n    probably by the use of sprintf.\n\n    Data type to string converters are useful for applications that\n    wish to convert an internal data type value into a string so that\n    they can write out a valid resource specification to a file.  This\n    mechanism can be used to provide a \"snapshot\" of application state\n    into a file.  This snapshot can be used to restore the program to\n    a known state via the usual X resource database mechanisms.\n\n    If you are taking the trouble to write a string to data type\n    converter, it isn't much extra effort to write the data type to\n    string converter.  Writing both at the same time helps to ensure\n    that they are consistent.\n\niii) data type to data type\n    This type of converter is used to convert an existing data type\n    value to another data type.  For instance, an X pixel value can be\n    converted to an RGB data type that contains separate fields for\n    red, green and blue.\n\n\nThe type signature for a resource converter is as follows:\n\ntypedef Boolean (*XtTypeConverter)(Display *, XrmValuePtr, Cardinal *,\n\tXrmValuePtr, XrmValuePtr, XtPointer *);\n    Display *dpy;\n    XrmValuePtr args;\n    Cardinal *num_args;\n    XrmValuePtr fromVal;\n    XrmValuePtr toVal;\n    XtPointer *converter_data;\n\nWhen the converter is invoked, the \"fromVal\" argument points to the source\nX resource manager value and the \"toVal\" argument points to the\ndestination X resource manager value.  The \"converter_data\" argument\nis an opaque pointer to some converter-specific data that is specified\nwhen the converter is registered.  The \"args\" and \"num_args\" arguments\nallow extra information to be passed to the converter when it is\ninvoked.  For instance, the Pixel to RGB structure converter discussed\nabove would need colormap and visual arguments in which to lookup the\nPixel to obtain the RGB values corresponding to that pixel.\n\nCare must be taken with the \"toVal\" argument.  An XrmValue has the\nfollowing type definition and specifies a size and location for a\nconverted value:\n\ntypedef struct {\n    unsigned int    size;\n    caddr_t         addr;\n} XrmValue, *XrmValuePtr;\n\nWhen the converter is invoked, the address may point to a location of\nthe given size for the converted value or the location can be NULL.\nIn the former case, the converter should ensure that the size of the\ndestination area is large enough to handle the converted value.  If\nthe destination area is not large enough, then the converter should\nset the size to the amount of space needed and return False.  The\ncaller can then ensure that enough space is allocated and reinvoke the\nconverter.  If the size is large enough, then the converter can simply\ncopy the converted value into the space given and return True.\n\nIf the location is NULL, then the converter can assign the location to\nthe address of a static variable containing the converted value and\nreturn True.\n\nWhen writing a group of converters, this code is often repeated and it\nbecomes convenient to define a macro:\n\n    #define DONE(var, type) \\\n      if (toVal->addr) \\\n\t{ \\\n\t  if (toVal->size < sizeof(type)) \\\n\t    { \\\n\t      toVal->size = sizeof(type); \\\n\t      return False; \\\n\t    } \\\n\t  else \\\n\t    *((type *) toVal->addr) = var; \\\n\t} \\\n      else \\\n\ttoVal->addr = (caddr_t) &var; \\\n      toVal->size = sizeof(type); \\\n      return True;\n\n    #define DONESTR(str) \\\n      if (toVal->addr && toVal->size < sizeof(String)) \\\n\t{ \\\n\t  toVal->size = sizeof(String); \\\n\t  return False; \\\n\t} \\\n      else \\\n\ttoVal->addr = (caddr_t) str; \\\n      toVal->size = sizeof(String); \\\n      return True;\n\nInside the converter, it is a good idea to perform a little safety\nchecking on the \"num_args\" and \"args\" arguments to ensure that your\nconverter is being called properly.\n\nOnce you have written your converter, you need to register it with the\nIntrinsics.  The Intrinsics invokes resource converters when creating\nwidgets and fetching their resource values from the resource database.\n\nTo register a converter with a single application context, use\nXtAppSetTypeConverter:\n\nvoid XtAppSetTypeConverter(context, from, to, converter, args, num_args,\n\tcache, destructor)\n    XtAppContext context;\n    String from;\n    String to;\n    XtTypeConverter converter;\n    XtConvertArgList args;\n    Cardinal num_args;\n    XtCacheType cache;\n    XtDestructor destructor;\n\nTo register a converter with all application contexts, use\nXtSetTypeConverter:\n\nvoid XtSetTypeConverter(from, to, converter, args, num_args,\n\tcache, destructor)\n    String from;\n    String to;\n    XtTypeConverter converter;\n    XtConvertArgList args;\n    Cardinal num_args;\n    XtCacheType cache;\n    XtDestructor destructor;\n\nIn the R3 Intrinsics, there were the routines XtAppAddConverter and\nXtAddConverter; these have been superseded by XtAppSetTypeConverter\nand XtSetTypeConverter.  Whenever possible, the newer routines should be\nused.\n\nWhen a converter is registered with the Intrinsics, a \"cache\" argument\nspecifies how converted resource values are to be cached:\n\n    XtCacheNone\t\tDon't cache any converted values\n    XtCacheAll\t\tCache all converted values\n    XtCacheByDisplay\tCache converted values on a per display basis\n\nCaching converted values that require a round-trip to the server is a\ngood idea (for instance string to Pixel conversions).\n\nThe \"destructor\" argument is a routine that is invoked then the\nresource is destroyed, either because its cached reference count has\nbeen decremented to zero or because the widget owning the value is\nbeing destroyed.  XtDestructor has the following type definition:\n\ntypedef void (*XtDestructor)(XtAppContext, XrmValuePtr, XtPointer,\n\tXrmValuePtr, Cardinal *);\n    XtAppContext context;\n    XrmValuePtr to;\n    XtPointer converter_data;\n    XrmValuePtr args;\n    Cardinal *num_args;\n\nThe destructor is invoked to free any auxiliary storage associated\nwith the \"to\" argument, but does not actually free the storage pointed\nto by the \"to\" argument itself (to->addr).  The destructor is passed\nthe extra arguments that were passed to the converter when the\nconversion was performed (for instance, colormap and visual arguments\nfor the string to Pixel converter since the destructor would need to\nfree the allocated Pixel from the colormap) as well as the private\ndata passed in when the converter was registered.\n\nSample converter code can be found in the following files in the MIT\nR5 distribution:\n\n    mit/lib/Xt/Converters.c\n    contrib/lib/PEXt/Converters.c\n    contrib/lib/PEXt/Converters.h\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n18. How do I open multiple displays?\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSee \"Multi-user Application Software Using Xt\", The X Resource, Issue 3,\n(Summer 1992) by Oliver Jones for a complete coverage of the issues\ninvolved.  Most of this answer is based on that article.  In a\nnutshell, one uses XtOpenDisplay() to add each display to a _single_\napplication context and then XtCloseDisplay() to shutdown each display\nand remove it from the application context.\n\nThe real problems occur when trying to close down a display.  This can\nhappen 3 ways:\n\t1. User selects a \"quit\" button on one of the displays,\n\t2. User has window manager send a WM_DELETE_WINDOW message,\n\t3. Server disconnect -- possibly from a KillClient message,\n\t   server shutdown/crash, or network failure.\n\nI'll assume you can deal gracefully with 1 & 2 since it is _merely_ a\nproblem of translating a Widget to a display and removing that\ndisplay.  If not, then read the Oliver Jones article.\n\nThe third one is difficult to handle.  The following is based on the\nOliver Jones article and I include it here because it is a difficult\nproblem.\n\nThe difficulty arises because the Xlib design presumed that an I/O\nerror is always unrecoverable and so fatal.  This is essentially true\nfor a single display X based application, but not true for a\nmultiple display program or an application that does things other than\ndisplay information on an X server.  When an X I/O error occurs the\nI/O error handler is called and _if_ it returns then an exit()\nhappens.  The only way around this is to use setjmp/longjmp to avoid\nreturning to the I/O error handler.  The following code fragment\ndemonstrates this:\n\n#include <setjmp.h>\njmp_buf XIOrecover;\n\nvoid\nXIOHandler (dpy)\n\tDisplay\t\t*dpy;\n{\n\tdestroyDisplay (dpy);\n\tlongjmp (XIOrecover, 1);\n}\n\nmain ()\n{\n\t...\n\tif (setjmp (XIOrecover) == 0)\n\t\tXSetIOErrorHandler (XIOHandler);\n\tXtAppMainLoop (app_context);\n}\n\nThe destroyDisplay() is something that given a Display pointer can go\nback to the application specific data and perform any necessary\ncleanup.  It should also call XtCloseDisplay().\n\nFor those of you unfamiliar with setjmp/longjmp, when setjmp() is\nfirst called it returns a 0 and save's enough information in the\njmp_buf that a latter execution of longjmp() can return the program to\nthe same state as if the setjmp() was just executed.  The return value\nof this second setjmp() is the value of the second argument to\nlongjmp().  There are several caveats about using these but for this\npurpose it is adequate.\n\nSome other problems you might run into are resource converters that\nimproperly cache resources.  The most likely symptoms are Xlib errors\nsuch as BadColor, BadAtom, or BadFont.  There may be problems with the\ntotal number of displays you can open since typically only a limited\nnumber of file descriptors are available with 32 being a typical\nvalue.  You may also run into authorization problems when trying to\nconnect to a display.\n\nThere was much discussion in comp.windows.x about this topic in\nNovember of 91.  Robert Scheifler posted an article which basically\nsaid this is the way it will be and Xlib will not change.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n19.

Where are the resources loaded from?\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe resources of a widget are filled in from the following places\n(from highest priority to lowest priority):\n\n\t1. Args passed at creation time.\n\t2. Command line arguments.\n\t3. User's per host defaults file\n\t4. User's defaults file.\n\t5. User's per application default file.\n\t6. System wide per application default file.\n\nNote that 2-6 are read only once on application startup.  The result\nof steps 3-6 is a single resource database used for further queries.\n\nThe per host defaults file contains customizations for all\napplications executing on a specific computer.  This file is either\nspecified with the XENVIRONMENT environment variable or if that is not\nset then the file $HOME/.Xdefaults-<host> is used.\n\nThe user defaults file is either obtained from the RESOURCE_MANAGER\nproperty on the root window of the display or if that is not set then\nthe file $HOME/.Xdefaults is used.  Typically, the program \"xrdb\" is\nused to set the RESOURCE_MANAGER property.  Please note that this\nshould be kept relatively small as each client that connects to the\ndisplay must transfer the property.  A size of around 1-3KByte is\nreasonable.  Some toolkits may track changes to the RESOURCE_MANAGER\nbut most do not.\n\nA user may have many per application default files containing\ncustomizations specific to each application.  The intrinsics are quite\nflexible on how this file is found.  Read the next part that describes\nthe various environment variables and how they effect where this file\nis found.\n\nThe system wide per application default files are typically found in\n/usr/lib/X11/app-defaults.  If such a file is not found then the\nfallback resources are used.  The intrinsics are quite flexible on how\nthis file is found.  Read the next part that describes the various\nenvironment variables and how they effect where this file is found.\n\n[Thanks to Oliver Jones (oj@pictel.com) for the following, 6/92]\n\nYou can use several environment variables to control how resources are\nloaded for your Xt-based programs -- XFILESEARCHPATH,\nXUSERFILESEARCHPATH, and XAPPLRESDIR.  These environment variables\ncontrol where Xt looks for application-defaults files as an\napplication is initializing.  Xt loads at most one app-defaults file\nfrom the path defined in XFILESEARCHPATH and another from the path\ndefined in XUSERFILESEARCHPATH.\n\nSet XFILESEARCHPATH if software is installed on your system in such a\nway that app-defaults files appear in several different directory\nhierarchies.  Suppose, for example, that you are running Sun's Open\nWindows, and you also have some R4 X applications installed in\n/usr/lib/X11/app-defaults. You could set a value like this for\nXFILESEARCHPATH, and it would cause Xt to look up app-defaults files\nin both /usr/lib/X11 and /usr/openwin/lib (or wherever your\nOPENWINHOME is located):\n\n\tsetenv XFILESEARCHPATH /usr/lib/X11/%T/%N:$OPENWINHOME/lib/%T/%N\n\nThe value of this environment variable is a colon-separated list of\npathnames.  The pathnames contain replacement characters as follows\n(see XtResolvePathname()):\n\n\t%N\tThe value of the filename parameter, or the\n\t\tapplication's class name.\n\t%T\tThe value of the file \"type\".  In this case, the\n\t\tliteral string \"app-defaults\"\n\t%C\tcustomization resource (R5 only)\n\t%S\tSuffix.  None for app-defaults.\n\t%L\tLanguage, locale, and codeset (e.g. \"ja_JP.EUC\")\n\t%l\tLanguage part of %L  (e.g. \"ja\")\n\t%t\tThe territory part of the display's language string\n\t%c\tThe codeset part of the display's language string\n\nLet's take apart the example.  Suppose the application's class name is\n\"Myterm\". Also, suppose Open Windows is installed in /usr/openwin.\n(Notice the example omits locale-specific lookup.)\n\n\t/usr/lib/X11/%T/%N        means /usr/lib/X11/app-defaults/Myterm\n\t$OPENWINHOME/lib/%T/%N    means /usr/openwin/lib/app-defaults/Myterm\n\nAs the application initializes, Xt tries to open both of the above\napp-defaults files, in the order shown.  As soon as it finds one, it\nreads it and uses it, and stops looking for others.  The effect of\nthis path is to search first in /usr/lib/X11, then in /usr/openwin.\n\nLet's consider another example. This time, let's set\nXUSERFILESEARCHPATH so it looks for the file Myterm.ad in the current\nworking directory, then for Myterm in the directory ~/app-defaults.\n\n\tsetenv XUSERFILESEARCHPATH ./%N.ad:$HOME/app-defaults/%N\n\nThe first path in the list expands to ./Myterm.ad.  The second expands\nto $HOME/app-defaults/Myterm.  This is a convenient setting for\ndebugging because it follows the Imake convention of naming the\napp-defaults file Myterm.ad in the application's source directory, so\nyou can run the application from the directory in which you are\nworking and still have the resources loaded properly.\n\nNOTE: when looking for app-default files with XUSERFILESEARCHPATH,\n      for some  bizarre reason, neither the type nor file suffix is\n      defined so %T and %S are useless.\n\nWith R5, there's another twist.  You may specify a customization\nresource value.  For example, you might run the \"myterm\" application\nlike this:\n\n\tmyterm -xrm \"*customization: -color\"\n\nIf one of your pathname specifications had the value\n\"/usr/lib/X11/app-defaults/%N%C\" then the expanded pathname would be\n\"/usr/lib/X11/app-defaults/Myterm-color\" because the %C substitution\ncharacter takes on the value of the customization resource.\n\nThe default XFILESEARCHPATH, compiled into Xt, is:\n\n\t\t/usr/lib/X11/%L/%T/%N%C:\\  (R5)\n\t\t/usr/lib/X11/%l/%T/%N%C:\\  (R5)\n\t\t/usr/lib/X11/%T/%N%C:\\     (R5)\n\t\t/usr/lib/X11/%L/%T/%N:\\\n\t\t/usr/lib/X11/%l/%T/%N:\\\n\t\t/usr/lib/X11/%T/%N\n\n(Note: some sites replace /usr/lib/X11 with a ProjectRoot in this\nbatch of default settings.)\n\nThe default XUSERFILESEARCHPATH, also compiled into Xt, is \n\n\t\t<root>/%L/%N%C:\\  (R5)\n\t\t<root>/%l/%N%C:\\  (R5)\n\t\t<root>/%N%C:\\     (R5)\n\t\t<root>/%L/%N:\\\n\t\t<root>/%l/%N:\\\n\t\t<root>/%N:\n\n<root> is either the value of XAPPLRESDIR or the user's home directory\nif XAPPLRESDIR is not set.  If you set XUSERFILESEARCHPATH to some\nvalue other than the default, Xt ignores XAPPLRESDIR altogether.\n\nNotice that the quick and dirty way of making your application find\nyour app-defaults file in your current working directory is to set\nXAPPLRESDIR to \".\", a single dot.  In R3, all this machinery worked\ndifferently; for R3 compatibilty, many people set their XAPPLRESDIR\nvalue to \"./\", a dot followed by a slash.\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n21. What order are callbacks executed in?\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n(Courtesy of Donna Converse, converse@expo.lcs.mit.edu; 5/10/92)\n\nThe Intrinsics library do not guarantee an order.  This is because\nboth the widget writer and the application writer have the ability to\nmodify the entire contents of the callback list.  Neither one\ncurrently knows what the other is doing and so the Intrinsics cannot\nguarantee the order of execution.\n\nThe application programmer cannot rely on the widget writer; the\nwidget writer is not required to document when the widget will add and\nremove callbacks from the list or what effect this will have;\ntherefore the functionality contained in a callback should be\nindependent of the functionality contained in other callbacks on the\nlist.\n\nEven though the Xt standard in the definition of XtAddCallback\n\n \t\"callback_name: Specifies the callback list to which the\n \tprocedure is to be appended.\"\n \nyou may not infer from the word \"appended\" that the callback routines\nare called in the same order as they have been added to the callback\nlist.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n22. How do I know if a widget is visible?\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n(Courtesy of Donna Converse, converse@expo.lcs.mit.edu; 5/14/92)\n\n\nRight, everything is implemented correctly.  This demonstrates a \"deficiency\"\nin the X protocol, and the Core widget is reflecting the capabilities of the\nprotocol.  (The \"deficiency\" is that the information is available in one way,\nin this case an inconvenient way.)  The Xt specification is accurate, in\nthe second and third paragraphs of section 7.10.2, so read this section\ncarefully.  The visible field will not change in response to iconification.\n\nA VisibilityNotify event will not be received when the window goes from\nviewable to unviewable, that is, when the widget or an ancestor is unmapped;\nthat is, when iconification occurs.  This is the protocol deficiency.\nVisibility state and viewable state have specific meanings in the X protocol;\nsee the glossary in your Xlib and X protocol reference manual.\n\n\nYou'll see this with any window manager, with no window manager.\n\n\nAs an application writer, keep track with a global Boolean in an action\nroutine with translations for MapNotify and UnmapNotify on the Shell widget\nwhich contains your custom widget.  As the custom widget writer, see the\nmap_state field returned by a call to XGetWindowAttributes.  These are\nsuggestions.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n23. How do I reparent a widget in Xt, i.e. XtReparentWidget()?\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nYou can't.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n24. Why use XtMalloc, XtFree, etc?\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nUnfortunately, most code that calls malloc(), realloc() or calloc()\ntends to ignore the possibility of returning NULL.  At best it is\nhandled something like:\n\n\tptr = (type *) malloc (sizeof (type))\n\tif (!ptr)\n\t{\n\t\tperror (\"malloc in xyzzy()\");\n\t\texit (1)\n\t}\nTo handle this common case the Intrinsics define the functions\nXtMalloc(), XtCalloc(), XtNew(), XtNewString() and XtRealloc() which\nall use the standard C language functions malloc(), calloc() and\nrealloc() but execute XtErrorMsg() if a NULL value is returned.  Xt\nerror handlers are not supposed to return so this effectively exits.\n\nIn addition, if XtRealloc() is called with a NULL pointer, it uses\nXtMalloc() to get the initial space.  This allows code like:\n\n\tif (!ptr)\n\t\tptr = (type *) malloc (sizeof (type));\n\telse\n\t\tptr = (type *) realloc (ptr, sizeof (type) * (count + 1));\n\t++count;\n\nto be written as:\n\n\tptr = XtRealloc (ptr, sizeof (ptr) * ++count);\n\nAlso, XtFree() accepts a NULL pointer as an argument.  Generally, I've\nfound the Xt functions conveniant to use.  However, anytime I'm\nallocating anything potentially large I use the standard functions so\nI can fully recover from not enough memory errors.\n\nXtNew() and XtNewString() are conveniant macros for allocating a\nstructure or copying a string:\n\n\t  struct abc *xyzzy;\n\t  char\t     *ptr;\n\t  char\t     *str = \"abcdef\";\n\n\t  xyzzy = XtNew (struct abc);\t/* takes care of type casting */\n\t  ptr = XtNewString (str);\n\nA strict interpretation of the Intrinsics reference manual allow an\nimplementation to provide functions that are not exchangable with\nmalloc() and free().  I.e. code such as:\n\n\t char\t      *ptr;\n\n\t ptr = XtMalloc (100);\n\t /* ... */\n\t free (ptr);\n\nmay not work.  Personally, I'd call any implementation that did this\nbroken and complain to the vendor.\n\nA common error for Motif programmers is to use XtFree() on a string\nwhen they should really be using XmStringFree().\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n25. How to debug an Xt application?\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nFirst, I'd recomend getting \"purify\" from Pure Software.  This is a\ngreat package for tracing memory problems on Sun's.  It's a bit pricey\nat $2750 but I'd still recomend it.  Excuse the marketing blurb\n(contact support@pure.com for more info).\n\n\tPurify inserts additional checking instructions directly into\n\tthe object code produced by existing compilers.  These\n\tinstructions check every memory read and write performed by\n\tthe program under test and detect several types of access\n\terrors, such as reading unitialized memory, writing past\n\tmalloc'd bounds, or writing to freed memory.  Purify inserts\n\tchecking logic into all of the code in a program, including\n\tthird party and vendor object-code libraries, and verifies\n\tsystem call interfaces.  In addition, Purify tracks memory\n\tusage and identifies individual memory leaks using a novel\n\tadaption of garbage collection techniques.  Purify's nearly\n\tcomprehensive memory access checking slows the target program\n\tdown typically by a factor of two to five.\n\nAn alternative package that isn't as pricey ($395 for a Sun), runs on\nmany Unix's and has pretty similar features is \"The SENTINEL Debugging\nEnvironment\".  This replaces malloc() and several other C library\nfunctions to add additional checks.  (contact cpcahil@virtech.vti.com\nfor more info)\n\nNext, if you are getting any sort of Xlib error, you'll need to run in\nsynchronous mode, easily accomplished with the \"-sync\" command line\nargument or by setting the variable Xdebug to 1 with your debugger.  Then\nset a break point in exit().  This will let you trace back to the\noriginal Xlib function being called.  If you don't run in synchronous\nmode, then the actual error may have occured any number of calls to\nXlib previously since the Xlib calls are buffered and replies from the\nserver are asynchronous.\n\nNext, if you are having trouble with window layout, you can use the\nundocumented resource \"xtIdentifyWindows\" or the class resource\n\"XtDebug\" to cause the widget name to be identified with each window.\nFor example:\n\n    example% xload -xrm '*XtDebug:true' &\n    example% xwininfo -tree\n\t     <click in new xload window>\n\nwill give the normal information but the widget name and class of each\nwindow is included.  This can help for checking the location and size\nof errant widgets.\n\nNext, if you are having trouble with geometry managers or you want to\ntest the way a widget manages it's children, you can try\nexport.lcs.mit.edu:contrib/libXtGeo.tar.Z.  This acts as a filter\nbetween any children and a geometry manager and checks the behaviour\nof both.  It's a very clever idea.\n\nThe most unfortunate problem is debugging a callback while the\napplication is executing a grab of the keyboard or mouse (such as from\na pulldown menu).  The server effectively locks up and you'll need to\ngo to another machine and kill the debugger manually.  The server\nlocks up because the application being debugged has said no one else\ncan have access to the keyboard but the application is not stopped\nwaiting because the debugger is waiting for your commands.\nUnfortunately you can't give them because all the input is going to\nyour application which is stopped.\n\nThe best way to debug this kind of problem is with two machines on\nyour desk, running the program under a debugger (or other environment)\non one machine, and running the application on the other, possibly\nusing a command sequence like this:\n\n\tothermachine% xhost +thismachine\n\tthismachine% setenv DISPLAY othermachine:0;\n\tthismachine% gdb application\t# Your favorite debugger.\n\tor this:\n\tothermachine% xhost +thismachine\n\tthismachine% gdb application\n\t(gdb) set environment DISPLAY othermachine:0\n\t(gdb) run ...\n\nI believe CodeCenter, a C interpreter/graphical debugger has a method\nof dealing with this by explicitely calling the Xlib functions to\nrelease any grabs during breakpoints.\n\nDebugging widget problems requires pretty good debugging skills and\nknowledge of how widgets work.  You can go a long way without knowing\nthe internals of a particular widget but not very far without\nunderstanding how a widget works.  Judicious use of conditional\nbreakpoints and adding print statements with the debugger help a great\ndeal.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n26. Why don't XtAddInput(), XtAddTimeout() and XtAddWorkProc() work?\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n   I have got a delicate problem with the three routines XtAddInput,\n   XtAddTimeOut and XtAddWorkProc. The problem I have is that when\n   I use them in my application they seem not to be registred properly.\n   I have made a handy little testprogram where everything works\n   perfect, but in my \"real\" application nothing happens. \n\nThe introduction in R3 of the XtApp*() functions obsoleted those\nroutines (see Q19 for other changes in R3, R4, and R5).  What happens is\nthey use a default application context different then the one you may\nhave created.  Since events and timeouts are distributed on a per\napplication context basis and you are using two application contexts,\nyou won't get those events.\n\nFor example:\n\n\t...\n\tcnt = 0;\n\ttoplevel = XtAppInitialize(&app, class,\n\t\t\t\t   Desc, XtNumber (Desc),\n\t\t\t\t   &argc, argv,\n\t\t\t\t   Fallback, args, cnt);\n\n\tXtAddTimeOut (...)\n\tXtAddWorkProc (...)\n\n\tXtAppMainLoop (app)\n\nwould never invoke the timeout.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n27. What is and how can I implement drag and drop?\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n(Courtesy of Roger Reynolds, rogerr@netcom.com; 19 Feb 93)\n\nDrag-n-drop is a buzzword for moving data between clients, in an\n``intuitive'' fashion.\n\nMotif Version 1.2 supports drag-n-drop capabilities, OpenLook has\nsupported d-n-d all along.  The two protocols are not compatable with\neach other, and so far as I know, they are not published.\n\nI wrote a package called RDD which is designed to be a flexible public\nprotocol for doing drag 'n drop operations between clients.  My\nintention was to provide a tool which would make it easy for people to\nsupport a \"standard\" drag-n-drop protocol in the programs they develop\nand contribute or sell, regardless of what widget set is used (as long\nas it is based on Xt).\n\nThe implementation is based upon my understanding of the ICCCM\nconventions, for more details read the code.\n\nI have heard from dozens of people using RDD who like it and feel that\nit works a whole lot better than Motif 1.2 stuff.  Also, there seem to\nbe many who think that it is neat but are constrained to use Motif\nanyway.\n\nThe latest RDD (and some other stuff) is available for ftp from\nnetcom.com, in /pub/rogerr.

The Cryptography \nFAQ is posted to the newsgroups sci.crypt, sci.answers, and news.answers\nevery 21 days.\n\n\nContents:\n\n* In mathematical terms, what is a private-key cryptosystem?\n* What is an attack?\n* What's the advantage of formulating all this mathematically?\n* Why is the one-time pad secure?\n* What's a ciphertext-only attack?\n* What's a known-plaintext attack?\n* What's a chosen-plaintext attack?\n* In mathematical terms, what can you say about brute-force attacks?\n* What's a key-guessing attack? What's entropy?\n\n\n* In mathematical terms, what is a private-key cryptosystem?\n\n  A private-key cryptosystem consists of an encryption system E and a\n  decryption system D. The encryption system E is a collection of\n  functions E_K, indexed by ``keys'' K, mapping some set of\n  ``plaintexts'' P to some set of ``ciphertexts'' C. Similarly the\n  decryption system D is a collection of functions D_K such that\n  D_K(E_K(P)) = P for every plaintext P.  That is, succesful decryption\n  of ciphertext into plaintext is accomplished using the same key\n  (index) as was used for the corresponding encryption of plaintext\n  into ciphertext.  Such systems, wherein the same key value is used to\n  encrypt and decrypt, are also known as ``symmetric'' cryptoystems.\n\n* What is an attack?\n\n  In intuitive terms a (passive) attack on a cryptosystem is any method\n  of starting with some information about plaintexts and their\n  corresponding ciphertexts under some (unknown) key, and figuring out\n  more information about the plaintexts. It's possible to state\n  mathematically what this means. Here we go.\n\n  Fix functions F, G, and H of n variables. Fix an encryption system E,\n  and fix a distribution of plaintexts and keys.\n\n  An attack on E using G assuming F giving H with probability p is an\n  algorithm A with a pair f, g of inputs and one output h, such that\n  there is probability p of computing h = H(P_1,...,P_n), if we have\n  f = F(P_1,...,P_n) and g = G(E_K(P_1),...,E_K(P_n)). Note that this\n  probability depends on the distribution of the vector (K,P_1,...,P_n).\n\n  The attack is trivial (or ``pointless'') if there is probability at\n  least p of computing h = H(P_1,...,P_n) if f = F(P_1,...,P_n) and\n  g = G(C_1,...,C_n). Here C_1,...,C_n range uniformly over the possible\n  ciphertexts, and have no particular relation to P_1,...,P_n. In other\n  words, an attack is trivial if it doesn't actually use the encryptions\n  E_K(P_1),...,E_K(P_n).\n\n  An attack is called ``one-ciphertext'' if n = 1, ``two-ciphertext'' if\n  n = 2, and so on.\n\n* What's the advantage of formulating all this mathematically?\n\n  In basic cryptology you can never prove that a cryptosystem is secure.\n  Read part 3: we keep saying ``a strong cryptosystem must have this\n  property, but having this property is no guarantee that a cryptosystem\n  is strong!''\n\n  In contrast, the purpose of mathematical cryptology is to precisely\n  formulate and, if possible, prove the statement that a cryptosystem is\n  strong. We say, for example, that a cryptosystem is secure against\n  all (passive) attacks if any nontrivial attack against the system (as\n  defined above) is too slow to be practical. If we can prove this\n  statement then we have confidence that our cryptosystem will resist\n  any (passive) cryptanalytic technique. If we can reduce this statement\n  to some well-known unsolved problem then we still have confidence that\n  the cryptosystem isn't easy to break.\n\n  Other parts of cryptology are also amenable to mathematical\n  definition. Again the point is to explicitly identify what assumptions\n  we're making and prove that they produce the desired results. We can\n  figure out what it means for a particular cryptosystem to be used\n  properly: it just means that the assumptions are valid.\n\n  The same methodology is useful for cryptanalysis too. The cryptanalyst\n  can take advantage of incorrect assumptions. Often he can try to\n  construct a proof of security for a system, see where the proof fails,\n  and use these failures as the starting points for his analysis.\n  \n* Why is the one-time pad secure?\n\n  By definition, the one-time pad is a cryptosystem where the\n  plaintexts, ciphertexts, and keys are all strings (say byte strings)\n  of some length m, and E_K(P) is just the sum (let's say the exclusive\n  or) of K and P.\n\n  It is easy to prove mathematically that there are _no_ nontrivial\n  single-ciphertext attacks on the one-time pad, assuming a uniform\n  distribution of keys. Note that we don't have to assume a uniform\n  distribution of plaintexts. (Here's the proof: Let A be an attack,\n  i.e., an algorithm taking two inputs f, g and producing one output h,\n  with some probability p that h = H(P) whenever f = F(P) and\n  g = G(E_K(P)) (i.e., g = G(K + P)). Then, because the distribution of\n  K is uniform and independent of P, the distribution of K + P must also\n  be uniform and independent of P. But also the distribution of C is\n  uniform and independent of P. Hence there is probability exactly p\n  that h = H(P) whenever f = F(P) and g = G(C), over all P and C. Thus\n  a fortiori A is trivial.)\n\n  On the other hand the one-time pad is _not_ secure if a key K is used\n  for more than one plaintext: i.e., there are nontrivial\n  multiple-ciphertext attacks. So to be properly used a key K must be\n  thrown away after one encryption. The key is also called a ``pad'';\n  this explains the name ``one-time pad.''\n\n* What's a ciphertext-only attack?\n\n  In the notation above, a ciphertext-only attack is one where F is\n  constant. Given only some information G(E_K(P_1),...,E_K(P_n)) about\n  n ciphertexts, the attack has to have some chance of producing some\n  information H(P_1,...,P_n) about the plaintexts. The attack is trivial\n  if it has just as good a chance of producing H(P_1,...,P_n) when given\n  G(C_1,...,C_n) for random C_1,...,C_n.\n\n  For example, say G(C) = C, and say H(P) is the first bit of P. We can\n  easily write down an attack---the ``guessing attack,'' which simply\n  guesses that H(P) is 1. This attack is trivial because it doesn't use\n  the ciphertext: it has a fifty-fifty chance of guessing correctly no\n  matter what. On the other hand there is an attack on RSA which\n  produces one bit of information about P, with 100% success, using C.\n  If it is fed a random C then the success rate drops to 50%. So this is\n  a nontrivial attack.\n\n* What's a known-plaintext attack?\n\n  The classic known-plaintext attack has F(P_1,P_2) = P_1,\n  G(C_1,C_2) = (C_1,C_2), and H(P_1,P_2) depending only on P_2.\n  In other words, given two ciphertexts C_1 and C_2 and one decryption\n  P_1, the known-plaintext attack should produce information about the\n  other decryption P_2.\n\n  Note that known-plaintext attacks are often defined in the literature\n  as producing information about the key, but this is pointless: the\n  cryptanalyst generally cares about the key only insofar as it lets him\n  decrypt further messages.\n\n* What's a chosen-plaintext attack?\n\n  A chosen-plaintext attack is the first of an increasingly impractical\n  series of _active_ attacks on a cryptosystem: attacks where the\n  cryptanalyst feeds data to the encryptor. These attacks don't fit into\n  our model of passive attacks explained above. Anyway, a\n  chosen-plaintext attack lets the cryptanalyst choose a plaintext and\n  look at the corresponding ciphertext, then repeat until he has figured\n  out how to decrypt any message. More absurd examples of this sort of\n  attack are the ``chosen-key attack'' and ``chosen-system attack.''\n\n  A much more important form of active attack is a message corruption\n  attack, where the attacker tries to change the ciphertext in such a\n  way as to make a useful change in the plaintext.\n\n  There are many easy ways to throw kinks into all of these attacks:\n  for instance, automatically encrypting any plaintext P as\n  T,E_K(h(T+R+P),R,P), where T is a time-key (sequence number) chosen anew\n  for each message, R is a random number, and h is a one-way hash\n  function. Here comma means concatenation and plus means exclusive-or.\n\n* In mathematical terms, what can you say about brute-force attacks?\n\n  Consider the following known-plaintext attack. We are given some\n  plaintexts P_1,...,P_{n-1} and ciphertexts C_1,...,C_{n-1}. We're\n  also given a ciphertext C_n. We run through every key K. When we find\n  K such that E_K(P_i) = C_i for every i < n, we print D_K(C_n).\n\n  If n is big enough that only one key works, this attack will succeed\n  on valid inputs all the time, while it will produce correct results\n  only once in a blue moon for random inputs. Thus this is a nontrivial\n  attack. Its only problem is that it is very slow if there are many\n  possible keys.\n\n* What's a key-guessing attack? What's entropy?\n\n  Say somebody is using the one-time pad---but isn't choosing keys\n  randomly and uniformly from all m-bit messages, as he was supposed to\n  for our security proof. In fact say he's known to prefer keys which\n  are English words. Then a cryptanalyst can run through all English\n  words as possible keys. This attack will often succeed, and it's much\n  faster than a brute-force search of the entire keyspace.","label":"sci.crypt"}

Born in 1926.\n\nOn that day, February 28, we were at home. Of course we had heard that there \nwas unrest in town, my younger brother Aleksandr had told us about it. But we \ndidn't think . . . we thought that everything would happen outdoors, that they\nwouldn't go into people's apartments. About five o'clock we saw a large crowd \nnear the Kosmos movie theater in our microdistrict. We were sitting at home \nwatching television. We go out on the balcony and see the crowd pour into Mir \nStreet. This is right near downtown, next to the airline ticket office, our \nhouse is right nearby. That day there was a group of policeman with shields\nthere. They threw rocks at those policemen. Then they moved off in the \ndirection of our building. They burned a motorcycle in our courtyard and \nstarted shouting for Armenians to come out of the building. We switched off \nthe light. As it turns out, their signal was just the opposite: to turn on the\nlight. That meant that it was an Azerbaijani home. We, of course, didn't know \nand thought that if they saw lights on they would come to our apartment.\n\nSuddenly there's pounding on the door. We go to the door, all four of us:\nthere were four of us in the apartment. Father, Mother, my younger brother\nAleksandr, and I. He was born in 1959. My father was a veteran of World War \nII and had fought in China and in the Soviet Far East; he was a pilot.\n\nWe went to the door and they started pounding on it harder, breaking it down \nwith axes. We start to talk to them in Azerbaijani, \"What's going on? What's \nhappened?\" They say, \"Armenians, get out of here!\" We don't open the door, we \nsay, \"If we have to leave, we'll leave, we'll leave tomorrow.\" They say, \"No, \nleave now, get out of here, Armenian dogs, get out of here!\" By now they've \nbroken the door both on the lock and the hinge sides. We hold them off as best\nwe can, my father and I on one side, and my mother and brother on the other. \nWe had prepared ourselves: we had several hammers and an axe in the apartment,\nand grabbed what we could find to defend ourselves. They broke in the door and\nwhen the door gave way, we held it for another half-hour. No neighbors, no\npolice and no one from the city government came to our aid the whole time. We \nheld the door. They started to smash the door on the lock side, first with an \naxe, and then with a crowbar.\n\nWhen the door gave way--they tore it off its hinges--Sasha hit one of them \nwith the axe. The axe flew out of his hands. They also had axes, crowbars, \npipes, and special rods made from armature shafts. One of them hit my father \nin the head. The pressure from the mob was immense. When we retreated into the\nroom, one of them hit my mother, too, in the left part of her face. My brother\nSasha and I fought back, of course. Sasha is quite strong and hot-tempered, he\nwas the judo champion of Sumgait. We had hammers in our hands, and we injured \nseveral of the bandits--in the heads and in the eyes, all that went on. But \nthey, the injured ones, fell back, and others came to take their places, there\nwere many of them.\n\nThe door fell down at an angle. The mob tried to remove the door, so as to go \ninto the second room and to continue . . . to finish us off. Father brought \nskewers and gave them to Sasha and me--we flew at them when we saw Father \nbleeding: his face was covered with blood, he had been wounded in the head, \nand his whole face was bloody. We just threw ourselves on them when we saw \nthat. We threw ourselves at the mob and drove back the ones in the hall, drove\nthem down to the third floor. We came out on the landing, but a group of the \nbandits remained in one of the rooms they were smashing all the furniture in \nthere, having closed the door behind them. We started tearing the door off to \nchase away the remaining ones or finish them. Then a man, an imposing man of \nabout 40, an Azerbaijani, came in. When he was coming in, Father fell down and\nMother flew to him, and started to cry out. I jumped out onto the balcony and \nstarted calling an ambulance, but then the mob started throwing stones through\nthe windows of our veranda and kitchen. We live on the fourth floor. And no \none came. I went into the room. It seemed to me that this man was the leader \nof the group. He was respectably dressed in a hat and a trench coat with a \nfur collar. And he addressed my mother in Azerbaijani: \"What's with you, \nwoman, why are you shouting? What happened? Why are you shouting like that?\"\nShe says, \"What do you mean, what happened? You killed somebody!\" My father \nwas a musician, he played the clarinet, he played at many weddings, Armenian \nand Azerbaijani, he played for many years. Everyone knew him. Mother says, \n\"The person who you killed played at thousands of Azerbaijani weddings, he \nbrought so much joy to people, and you killed that person.\" He says, \"You \ndon't need to shout, stop shouting.\" And when they heard the voice of this \nman, the 15 to 18 people who were in the other room opened the door and \nstarted running out. We chased after them, but they ran away. That man left, \ntoo. As we were later told, downstairs one of them told the others, I don't \nknow if it was from fright or what, told them that we had firearms, even\nthough we only fought with hammers and an axe. We raced to Father and started \nto massage his heart, but it was already too late. We asked the neighbors to \ncall an ambulance. The ambulance never came, although we waited for it all \nevening and all through the night.\n\nSomewhere around midnight about 15 policemen came. They informed us they were \nfrom Khachmas. They said, \"We heard that a group was here at your place, you \nhave our condolences.\" They told us not to touch anything and left. Father lay\nin the room.\n\nSo we stayed home. Each of us took a hammer and a knife. We sat at home. Well,\nwe say, if they descend on us again we'll defend ourselves. Somewhere around \none o'clock in the morning two people came from the Sumgait Procuracy, \ninvestigators. They say, \"Leave everything just how it is, we're coming back \nhere soon and will bring an expert who will record and photograph everything.\"\nThen people came from the Republic Procuracy too, but no one helped us take \nFather away. The morning came and the neighbors arrived. We wanted to take \nFather away somehow. We called the Procuracy and the police a couple of times,\nbut no one came. We called an ambulance, and nobody came. Then one of the \nneighbors said that the bandits were coming to our place again and we should \nhide. We secured the door somehow or other. We left Father in the room and \nwent up to the neighbor's.\n\nThe excesses began again in the morning. The bandits came in several vehicles,\nZIL panel trucks, and threw themselves out of the vehicles like . . . a \nlanding force near the center of town. Our building was located right there. A\ncrowd formed. Then they started fighting with the soldiers. Then, in Buildings\n19 and 20, that's next to the airline ticket office, they started breaking \ninto Armenian apartments, destroying property, and stealing. The Armenians \nweren't at home, they had managed to flee and hide somewhere. And again they \npoured in the direction of our building. They were shouting that there were \nsome Armenians left on the fourth floor, meaning us. \"They're up there, still,\nup there. Let's go kill them!\" They broke up all the furniture remaining in \nthe two rooms, threw it outside, and burned it in large fires. We were hiding \none floor up. Something heavy fell. Sasha threw himself toward the door \nshouting that it was probably Father, they had thrown Father, were defiling \nthe corpse, probably throwing it in the fire, going to burn it. I heard it, \nand the sound was kind of hollow, and I said, \"No, that's from some of the \nfurniture.\" Mother and I pounced on Sasha and stopped him somehow, and calmed \nhim down.\n\nThe mob left somewhere around eight o'clock. They smashed open the door and \nwent into the apartment of the neighbors across from us. They were also\nArmenians, they had left for another city.\n\nThe father of the neighbor who was concealing us came and said, \"Are you \ncrazy? Why are you hiding Armenians? Don't you now they're checking all the \napartments? They could kill you and them!\" And to us :\" . . . Come on, leave \nthis apartment!\" We went down to the third floor, to some other neighbors'. At\nfirst the man didn't want to let us in, but then one of his sons asked him and\nhe relented. We stayed there until eleven o'clock at night. We heard the sound\nof motors. The neighbors said that it was armored personnel carriers. We went \ndownstairs. There was a light on in the room where we left Father. In the \nother rooms, as we found out later, all the chandeliers had been torn down. \nThey left only one bulb. The bulb was burning, which probably was a signal \nthey had agreed on because there was a light burning in every apartment in our\nMicrodistrict 3 where there had been a pogrom.\n\nWith the help of the soldiers we made it to the City Party Committee and were \nsaved. Our salvation--my mother's, my brother's, and mine,--was purely \naccidental, because, as we later found out from the neighbors, someone in the \ncrowd shouted that we had firearms up there. Well, we fought, but we were only\nable to save Mother. We couldn't save Father. We inflicted many injuries on \nthe bandits, some of them serious. But others came to take their places. We \nwere also wounded, there was blood, and we were scratched all over--we got our\nshare. It was a miracle we survived. We were saved by a miracle and the \ntroops. And if troops hadn't come to Sumgait, the slaughter would have been \neven greater: probably all the Armenians would have been victims of the \ngenocide.\n\nThrough an acquaintance at the City Party Committee I was able to contact the \nleadership of the military unit that was brought into the city, and at their \norders we were assigned special people to accompany us, experts. We went to '\npick up Father's corpse. We took it to the morgue. This was about two o'clock \nin the morning, it was already March 1, it was raining very hard and it was \nquite cold, and we were wearing only our suits. When my brother and I carried \nFather into the morgue we saw the burned and disfigured corpses. There were \nabout six burned people in there, and the small corpse of a burned child. It \nwas gruesome. I suffered a tremendous shock. There were about ten people \nthere, but the doctor on duty said that because of the numbers they were being\ntaken to Baku. There was a woman's corpse there too, she had been . . . well, \nthere was part of a body there . . . a hacked-off part of a woman's body. It \nwas something terrible. The morgue was guarded by the landing force . . . The \nchild that had been killed was only ten or twelve years old. It was impossible\nto tell if it was a boy or a girl because the corpse was burned. There was a \nman there, too, several men. You couldn't tell anything because their faces \nwere disfigured, they were in such awful condition...\n\nNow two and a half months have passed. Every day I recall with horror what \nhappened in the city of Sumgait. Every day: my father, and the death of my \nfather, and how we fought, and the people's sorrow, and especially the morgue.\n\nI still want to say that 70 years have passed since Soviet power was\nestablished, and up to the very last minute we could not conceive of what \nhappened  in Sumgait. It will go down in history.\n\nI'm particularly surprised that the mob wasn't even afraid of the troops. They\neven fought the soldiers. Many soldiers were wounded. The mob threw fuel \nmixtures onto the armored personnel carriers, setting them on fire. They \nweren't afraid. They were so sure of their impunity that they attacked our \ntroops. I saw the clashes on February 29 near the airline ticket office, right\nacross from our building. And that mob was fighting with the soldiers. The \ninhabitants of some of the buildings, also Azerbaijanis, threw rocks at the \nsoldiers from windows, balconies, even cinder blocks and glass tanks. They \nweren't afraid of them. I say they were sure of their impunity. When we were \nat the neighbors' and when they were robbing homes near the airline ticket \noffice I called the police at number 3-20-02 and said that they were robbing \nArmenian apartments and burning homes. And they told me that they knew that \nthey were being burned. During those days no one from the police department \ncame to anyone's aid. No one came to help us, either, to our home, even though\nperhaps they could have come and saved us.\n\nAs we later found out the mob was given free vodka and drugs, near the bus \nstation. Rocks were distributed in all parts of town to be thrown and used in \nfighting. So I think all of it was arranged in advance. They even knew in \nwhich buildings and apartments the Armenians lived, on which floors--they had\nlists, the bandits. You can tell that the \"operation\" was  planned in advance.\n\nThanks, of course, to our troops, to the country's leadership, and to the\nleadership of the Ministry of Defense for helping us, thanks to the Russian\npeople, because the majority of the troops were Russians, and the troops \nsuffered losses, too. I want to express this gratitude in the name of my \nfamily and in the name of all Armenians, and in the name of all Sumgait\nArmenians. For coming in time and averting terrible things: worse would\nhave happened if that mob had not been stopped on time.\n\nAt present an investigation is being conducted on the part of the USSR\nProcuracy. I want to say that those bandits should receive the severest\npossible punishment, because if they don't, the tragedy, the genocide, could \nhappen again. Everyone should see that the most severe punishment is meted\nout for such deeds.\n\nVery many bandits and hardened hooligans took part in the unrest, in the mass \ndisturbances. The mobs were huge. At present not all of them have been caught,\nvery few of them have been, I think, judging by the newspaper reports. There \nwere around 80 people near our building alone, that's how many people took \npart in the pogrom of our building all in all.\n\nThey should all receive the most severe punishment so that others see that \nretribution awaits those who perform such acts.\n\n   May 18, 1988\n   Yerevan\n\n\t\t     - - - reference - - -\n\n[1] _The Sumgait Tragedy; Pogroms against Armenians in Soviet Azerbaijan,\n    Volume I, Eyewitness Accounts_, edited by Samuel Shahmuradian, forward by\n    Yelena Bonner, 1990, published by Aristide D.

{"text":"Classify the following data: LISTOWNER: I have sent this to Mr Anderson privately. Post it only\nif you think it of general interest.\n\nHere is a copy of something I wrote for another list. You may\nfind it relevant.\n\nA listmember asks:\n\n > What makes common-law marriages wrong?\n\nA common-law marriage is not necessarily wrong in itself. There is\nnothing in the Bible (Old or New Testament) about getting married by\na preacher, or by a priest (Jewish or Christian). And in fact Jewish\npriests have never had any connection with weddings.\n\nThere is a common notion that the marriage is performed by the\nclergyman. In fact, the traditional Christian view (at least in the\nWest) is that the bride and groom are the ministers of the marriage,\nand that the clergyman is there only as a witness.\n\nHOWEVER!\n\nThe essential ingredient of a marriage is mutual commitment. Two\npersons are considered to be married if and only if they have bound\nthemselves by mutual promises to live together as husband and wife,\nforsaking all others, till death do them part.\n\n      The reason why those who have reason to be concerned about who\nis married to whom have always insisted on some kind of public\nceremony is in order that society, and the couple themselves, may be\nclear about whether a commitment has been made.\n\nSuppose that we do away with the public ceremony, the standard vows,\netc. Instead, we have a man and a woman settling down to live\ntogether.\n      After a year or so, the man says to the woman: Hey, honey, it\nwas great while it lasted, but I think it's time to move on.\nyounger.\nocean, as eternal as the stars. As long as I live, I am yours,\nutterly and completely. When I lie on my deathbed, my last feeble\nbreath will utter your name. My...\"\nman is in a romantic mood, he is bound to say all kinds of silly\nthings like that. You mustn't take them literally.\n\nAnd that is why you have an insistence on a formal ceremony that is\na matter of public record.\n      The Church insists on it, because it is her duty (among other\nthings) to give moral advice, and you cannot give a man moral advice\nabout his relations with a woman if you have no idea who is married\nto whom, if anybody, and vice versa.\n      The State insists on it, since the state has a concern with\nproperty rights, with child care and support, and therefore needs to\nknow who has made what commitments to whom.\n      Prospective fathers-in-law insist on it, because they don't\nwant their daughters seduced and abandoned.\n      Prospective spouses insist on it, because they want to make\nsure they know whether what they are hearing is a real commitment,\nor just \"poetry.\"\n      And persons making vows themselves insist on making them\nformally and publicly, in order that they may be clear in their own\nminds about what it is that they are doing, and may know themselves\nthat this is not just rhetoric. This is the real thing.\n\n      Hence the insistence on a formal public explicit avowal of the\nmarriage commitment.  The Church goes further and insists that, when\nChristians marry, a clergyman shall be present at the wedding and\nrecord the vows on behalf of the Church, not because it is\nimpossible to have a valid wedding without a clergyman, but in order\nto make sure that the couple understand what the Christian teaching\nabout marriage is, and that they are in fact promising to be married\nin a Christian sense. The Church also prefers a standard marriage\nvow, and is wary of letting couples Write their own vows, for much\nthe same reason that lawyers prefer standard terminology when they\ndraw up a will or a contract. Certain language has been repeatedly\nused in wills, and one can be sure how the courts will interpret it.\nTry to say the same thing in your own words, and you may find that\nthe probate judge's interpretation of them is not at all what you\nintended.  Similarly, the Church prefers to avoid endless debates\nabout whether \"You are my main squeeze\" and \"I am here for the long\nhaul\" do in fact cover the same territory as \"forsaking all others\"\nand \"till death do us part.\"\n\n      This topic has come up on the list before. (Is there any topic\nthat hasn't?) One listmember was asking, \"If a couple love each\nother and are living together, isn't that marriage in the eyes of\nGod?\" Eventually someone asked, \"In that case, what is their status\nif they break up? Is that the moral equivalent of getting a divorce?\nAre they in a relationship that God forbids either of them to walk\nof that!\" In fact, there are reasonable grounds for suspecting that\nsomeone who says, \"We don't need a piece of paper or a ceremony in\nfront of a judge or a preacher in order to show that we love each\nother,\" is trying to have it both ways -- to have the advantages of\nmarriage plus the option of changing his mind with a minimum of\nbother.\n\nAt this point someone may say, \"None of this applies to me and my\nmate. We are quite clear on the fact that we have assumed a lifelong\ncommitment, 'for better or worse, forsaking all others, till death\nus do part.' So in our case, no ceremony is needed.\"\n     To this my reply would be: The reason for requiring a driver's\nlicense is to keep dangerous drivers off the road.  What is wrong in\nitself is not the existence of unlicensed drivers, but the existence\nof dangerous drivers. However, testing and licensing drivers is an\nobvious and reasonable means of pursuing the goal of reducing the\nnumber of dangerous drivers on the road. Therefore the State rightly\nmakes and enforces such laws, and you the citizen have a positive\nmoral obligation to refrain from driving without a license no matter\nhow much of a hotshot behind the wheel you think you are.\n\nBack to the original question. We have a listmember who knows a\ncouple who have been living together for around 20 years. He asks:\nAt what point did they stop fornicating and start being married? I\nanswer: at the point, if any, where they both definitely and\nexplicitly accepted an obligation to be faithful to each other, for\nbetter or worse, as long as they both lived. If they have accepted\nsuch an obligation, what are their reasons for not being willing to\ndeclare it in front of, say, a justice of the peace?","label":"soc.religion.christian"}

I probably could just jam the air deflector to the \ndefrost position, but this blows a lot of air in my face and is, well,\nkind of like putting a vacuum cleaner in reverse.\n\nI have taken parts of the dash off and looked at the vacuum system and I think\nthe problem (or part of it) is with the two diaphragms which control up/down\nand outside/inside air flow.  THe diaphragm which controls outside(vent)/in-\nside(no vent) air is cracked most of the way around, and the other one is\nprobably damaged too, considering the advanced age of the car.\n\nTwo questions:\n\n\t1)  Is there anything I should be aware of about this (other than\n\tthe fact that I should move from Indiana) ?\n\n\t2)  In the event that replacement diaphragms aren't available, is there\n\ta way to \"fix\" this?\n\nTHanks for any advice/info\n\nselah,","label":"rec.autos"}

The new cryptography scheme was\nannounced today by the White House and the National Institute\nfor Standards and Technology (NIST), which will implement the\ntechnical specifications of the plan.  A NIST spokesman\nacknowledged that the National Security Agency (NSA), the super-\nsecret military intelligence agency, had actually developed the\nencryption technology around which the new initiative is built.\n\n        According to NIST, the technical specifications and the\nPresidential directive establishing the plan are classified.  To\nopen the initiative to public review and debate, CPSR today\nfiled a series of Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests\nwith key agencies, including NSA, NIST, the National Security\nCouncil and the FBI for information relating to the encryption\nplan.  The CPSR requests are in keeping with the spirit of the\nComputer Security Act, which Congress passed in 1987 in order to\nopen the development of non-military computer security standards\nto public scrutiny and to limit NSA's role in the creation of\nsuch standards.\n\n        CPSR previously has questioned the role of NSA in\ndeveloping the so-called \"digital signature standard\" (DSS), a\ncommunications authentication technology that NIST proposed for\ngovernment-wide use in 1991.  After CPSR sued NIST in a FOIA\nlawsuit last year, the civilian agency disclosed for the first\ntime that NSA had, in fact, developed that security standard.\nNSA is due to file papers in federal court next week justifying\nthe classification of records concerning its creation of the\nDSS.\n\n        David Sobel, CPSR Legal Counsel, called the\nadministration's apparent commitment to the privacy of\nelectronic communications, as reflected in today's official\nstatement,  \"a step in the right direction.\"  But he questioned\nthe propriety of NSA's role in the process and the apparent\nsecrecy that has thus far shielded the development process from\npublic scrutiny.  \"At a time when we are moving towards the\ndevelopment of a new information infrastructure, it is vital\nthat standards designed to protect personal privacy be\nestablished openly and with full public participation.  It is\nnot appropriate for NSA -- an agency with a long tradition of\nsecrecy and opposition to effective civilian cryptography -- to\nplay a leading role in the development process.\"\n\n        CPSR is a national public-interest alliance of computer\nindustry professionals dedicated to examining the impact of\ntechnology on society.

{"text":"Classify the following data: By Dave Luecking Of The Post-Dispatch Staff\n\nAt 9:11 Thursday night, the scoreboard watchers at The Arena began to cheer.\nTheir cheer quickly turned into a roar, and finally, the sellout crowd of\n17,816 rose as one to rock the old barn at 5700 Oakland Avenue in a salute to\nthe playoff-bound Blues.\n\nThe scoreboard had just flashed the news from Detroit -- Red Wings 5, Stars 3.\nWith the North Stars' loss, the Blues officially clinched fourth place and the\nfinal playoff spot in the Norris Division. Good thing, because the Blues quit\nplaying.\n\nThey held a 5-1 lead over Tampa Bay when the Detroit-Minnesota final appeared\nwith 3 minutes 52 remaining in the second period. They promptly went to sleep\nand barely held on for a 6-5 victory that nearly slipped away at the buzzer.\nTampa's Bob Beers tipped in a pass from Shawn Chambers, but officiating\nsupervisor John D'Amico and video goal judge Rich Schweigler ruled that the\nshot had gone into the net after time had expired.\n\n``I'm glad I didn't see it go in at the end,\" Blues coach Bob Berry said.\n\nIf the goal had counted, he'd have been more upset than he was by the Blues'\ndisappearance in the final 24 minutes. Holding on for the victory and making\nthe playoffs tempered Berry's anger.\n\n``It wasn't pretty at the end,\" he said. ``We played 36, 37 great minutes, as\ngood as we played all year. It slipped away at the end. It shouldn't have, but\nit did.\"\n\nStill, the Blues won, prompting another ovation from the crowd at game's end.\nDespite their shoddy effort in the third period and all the turmoil this\nseason, the Blues still made the playoffs. They'll meet the Chicago Blackhawks\nin a best-of-seven Norris Division semifinal, beginning at noon Sunday at\nChicago Stadium.\n\nThe Blues finished the regular-season with a record of 37-36-11 for 85 points,\ntheir fourth consecutive plus-.500 season. Minnesota finished three points\nbehind in fifth place, with a record of 36-38- 10 for 82 points. Tampa Bay,\nwhich played spoiler last week by tying the Blues 2-2 at Tampa, ended its\nfirst season with a record of 23-54-7 for 53 points.\n\nThe poor finish cast an unnecessary shadow over what should have been a joyous\nBlues locker room. Instead, the mood was one of relief and some disappointment.\n\n``It's a shame we let down,\" said Kevin Miller, one of three Blues to score\ntwo goals. Brendan Shanahan and Bob Bassen were the others.\n``There was no need for a letdown. If we'd have kept working, it would have\nended 6-2 and everyone would be happy.\"\n\nInstead, a lot of players were happy just to make the playoffs.\n``We won, and that's all that matters,\" said Brett Hull, scoreless and minus-3\nfor the night. ``Once we got up 4-0, it was really tough to play.\"\n\nSome players didn't have a problem.\n\n``Just because the score was announced, our line didn't quit,\" said Rich\nSutter, who played with Bassen and Miller. ``We still had a game to play. You\ncan't allow five goals like we did, that's not right.\n\n``It was disappointing to see what was going on.\"\n\nBassen was almost frantic on the bench because of the Blues' effort. Somehow,\nhe missed the announcement of Minnesota's loss.\n\n``I didn't know it was final,\" he said. ``I was kind of looking around on the\nbench. I didn't realize it was a final for some reason. We're in the playoffs,\nand that's great, but it's a little disappointing to play like we did at the\nend.\"\n\nThe letdown was precisely the reason that Berry had instructed the scoreboard\noperators to keep the Minnesota-Detroit score off of the board. The score\nshowed 0-0 until it first popped up with Detroit leading 4-2 in the third\nperiod. The Blues already led 4-0 at the time.\n\n``I told them I didn't want to see the score, I didn't want to know the score,\"\nBerry said. ``I felt we had to win the game, and that's the approach we took.\"\n\nIf Minnesota took a lead, Berry feared, the pressure of having to win might\nbother the Blues. If Detroit led, he worried, the Blues might quit.\n\nUntil the announcement, the Blues played splendidly. Shanahan got the crowd\ngoing at 10:44 of the first period, scoring his 50th of the season. Then,\nMiller and Bassen took charge late in the period.\n\nWith the teams playing four on four, Miller broke in on left wing, deked\ndefenseman Roman Hamrlik and beat former Blues goalie Pat Jablonski with the\nrebound of his own shot with 21.6 seconds remaining in the period.\n\nThen, just 10.5 seconds later, Bassen rifled a long slap shot past Jablonski\nafter defenseman Rick Zombo intercepted a Tampa pass in the neutral zone.\n\nBassen made it 4-0 just 14 seconds into the second period, scoring on the \nrebound of Bret Hedican's shot. The goal gave him his first two-goal game of\nthe season and reminded him of a special friend.\n\nLast year, Bassen befriended young Oliver Mulvihill, who died of a rare form\nof cancer at age 6 on Feb. 23.\n\n``I was thinking of my buddy Oliver,\" Bassen said. ``He's in heaven now, and\nI know he was watching. I know he's happy.\"\n\nMiller increased the Blues lead to 5-0 on a break-away goal set up by Zombo\nat 11:09. Then, Steve Maltais broke Curtis Joseph's shutout just 18 seconds\nlater, making it 5-1.\n\nLess than a minute after the North Stars' final was announced, Tim Bergland\nscored and cut the lead to 5-2. But Shanahan scored his 51st, converting a pass\nfrom Nelson Emerson with 21.3 seconds remaining in the  second period.\n\nThen, it was all Lightning. Adam Creighton scored 40 seconds into the third\nperiod, prompting Berry to rest the overworked Joseph. Guy Hebert allowed goals\nto Shawn Chambers and Danton Cole in a span of 1:21 midway through the third\nperiod.\n\nThe goals by Chambers and Cole made Shanahan's second goal stand up as the\nwinner. ``We were in there,\" Shanahan said. ``The game was over. We were in.\"","label":"rec.sport.hockey"}

{"text":"Classify the following data: \nI'll tell you my story as an example of what *not* to do.\n\nEarly in 1984 I took some riding lessons from my college roommate on\nhis old Honda CB360T.  He had taken the MSF beginner's course, so I\nactually learned *some* of what I needed to know to ride.\n\nI proceeded to buy a beat-up Honda CL350 for $400 and a $12 helmet and\nrode around wearing this and a cotton windbreaker.  Then I decided to\ninvest in a full-face helmet (first smart move).  Sometime around then\nI also passed my road test.\n\nOn May 4, 1984, I got caught in a rainstorm on my way home from a\n4-mile trip.  Entering the town where I lived (a rather urban suburb),\nI had to stop suddenly for a red light that I noticed too late,\nskidded the rear tire out, and was ejected face upward into the\noncoming lane of traffic.  Fortunately for me the oncoming traffic was\nalso stopped for the same red light, otherwise I might have slid under\na car and been killed.\n\nNow this is anecdotal evidence, to be sure, but I later took the\nExperienced Rider Course from the MSF and saw that earlier training\ncould have helped me greatly.  In your case the need is even greater\nsince you have nobody to help you practice even the most basic stuff\nas I did.\n\nSo my advice is to take the MSF beginner's course first thing.  I\nwouldn't even buy a bike until you've taken the course, unless you\nhappen to pick up a real good deal and can store it someplace until\nyou're ready to use it.\n\n\nWhile you're waiting to take the course (it might take a few weeks in\nDC, as I recall there were always waiting lists in Boston), could you\nsave up some more money to start out right?  Say $300 for riding gear,\nplus the cost bike, plus maybe $100 (guess) to a mechanic to make sure\nthe machine is safe (assuming you economize by buying some old beat-up\nmachine from a private individual), plus insurance, plus registration\nand licensing fees, plus the course, you're looking at maybe $600 not\nincluding the bike itself and a reserve for ongoing maintenance.\n\n\nI pay about $100 insurance now (upstate NY) but it was closer to $200\nin Boston (more urban) for decent insurance including substantial\ncoverage for liability, which you want unless you plan always to be\npoor.  I'd guess DC is more like Boston than like a rural area, ergo\nmore expensive.\n\n\nThere used to be annual buyer's guides in the usual motorcycle\nmagazines; I found those helpful in getting an idea of what new or\nrecent models might be available.  You could probably look through\npast issues to size up what used bikes might be available.  (My first\nbike was 13 years old when I bought it so I went on my friend's advice\ninstead.)  Also look at the bikes that you see people riding or that\nare parked on the street.  I basically settled on my present bike by\nnoticing that there were a lot of high-mileage BMW's running around\nand they were generally set up the way I wanted.\n\nNothing wrong with talking to various dealers in your area or visiting\nshowrooms.  Dealers in the Boston area, at least when I was shopping,\nwere very nice about letting you look around their showrooms and\nquoting prices for bikes that weren't the latest models (hence\ncheaper), although I ended up buying both bikes in private sales.","label":"rec.motorcycles"}

{"text":"Classify the following data: I'd *desparately* prefer it if we didn't rehash the same arguments\nthat went on ad infinitum last time.  That's especially true for\nsci.crypt.  For that matter, I've created alt.privacy.clipper, since\nthe traffic is appearing in *many* different groups right now.\n\nI'm going to focus here on some technical aspects of the plan, hence my\nfollowup to sci.crypt.  Frankly, if you're not an absolutist, your\nfeelings may turn on some of these issues.  For example -- with an\n80-bit key, simply splitting it into two 40-bit pieces is much less\nacceptable than other schemes, because it means that if just one\nrepository is, shall we say, overly pliable, a would-be eavesdropper\nwould need to recover just 40 more bits of key.  I need not point out\nin this newsgroup that that's pretty easy to do by exhaustive search.\nA slightly more complex scheme -- XOR-ing the key with a random number,\nand then with its complement -- would produce two 80-bit subkeys,\nneither of which is useful alone.  That variant is much more resistant\nto attack.  Clearly, one can get even more sophisticated, to protect\nthe subkeys even more.\n\nOther thoughts...  Some people have noted the size and complexity of\nthe databases necessary.  But the id strings the phones emit could be\ntheir back door key, double-encrypted with the escrow repositories'\npublic keys.  For that matter, they could do that only with session\nkeys, and have no back door at all.  In that case, the FBI would have\nto bring every intercept to the repositories to be decrypted.  This\nwould answer many of the objections along the lines of ``how do you\nmake sure they stop''.\n\nWe can even combine that with a variant of the digital telephony back\ndoor -- have the switch do the tap, but with a digitally-signed record\nof the time, phone number, etc, of the call.  That provides proof to\nthe escrow agents that the tap was done in compliance with the terms of\nthe warrant.\n\nI can suggest other variations, too.  Suppose each Clipper chip had 100\npublic key pairs.  Each would be used ~10 times, after which you'd need\nmore keying material.  (Not a bad idea in any event.)  This could be\nused to enforce time limits, or rather, usage limits, on each warrant;\nthe keys the repository agents would deliver wouldn't last for very\nlong.\n\nI suspect that the cryptographic algorithm itself is secure.  Apart from\nthe obvious -- why push a weak algorithm when you've already got the\nback door? -- I think that the government is still genuinely concerned\nabout foreign espionage, especially aimed at commercial targets.  This\nscheme lets the spooks have their cake and eat it, too.  (I've heard\nrumors, over the years, that some factions within NSA were unhappy with\nDES because it was too good.  Not that they couldn't crack it, but it\nwas much too expensive to do so as easily as they'd want.)  They're keeping\nthe details secret so that others don't build their own implementations\nwithout the back door.","label":"sci.crypt"}

{"text":"Classify the following data: \n\nThe problem is that Motif uses XGrabKey to implement menu accelerators,\nand these grabs are specific about which modifiers apply.  Unfortunately,\nthe specification for XGrabKey doesn't allow AnyModifier to be combined\nwith other modifiers, which is exactly what would be desired in this case:\n\"Ctrl Any<Key>q\".\n\n\nThis is true for accelerators and mnemonics, which are implemented using\nevent handlers instead of grabs; it's not true for menu accelerators.  If\nyou're a Motif implementor, I'd suggest lobbying to get the Xlib semantics\nchanged to support the feature I described above.  Otherwise, change the\ndocumentation for menu accelerators to properly set the user's\nexpectations, because menu accelerators are NOT the same thing as\ntranslations.\n\n\nIf you mean \"menu accelerator\", no it's not possible.  That's according to\nthe definition of the XmNaccelerator resource in the XmLabel manual page.\n\n\nI can't think of a reason why not.\n\n\nThere is a workaround for Motif users.  In addition to the normal menu\naccelerator you install on the XmPushButton[Gadget], set an XtNaccelerators\nresource on the shell (TopLevel or Application).  Install the shell's\naccelerators on itself and all of its descendants with\nXtInstallAllAccelerators (shell, shell).\n\nFor example,\n\n  applicationShell - mainWindow - menuBar - fileCascade\n\t\t\t\t\t  -- filePulldown - openPushbutton\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  - exitPushbutton\n\n  *openPushbutton.accelerator = Ctrl<Key>O\n  *openPushbutton.acceleratorText = Ctrl+O\n  *exitPushbutton.accelerator = Ctrl<Key>Q\n  *exitPushbutton.acceleratorText = Ctrl+Q\n\n  *applicationShell.accelerators = #override\\n\\\n    Ctrl<Key>O: PerformAction(*openPushbutton, ArmAndActivate)\\n\\\n    Ctrl<Key>Q: PerformAction(*exitPushbutton, ArmAndActivate)\n\nYou have to write and add the application action PerformAction, which you\ncan implement by using XtNameToWidget on the first argument and then\nXtCallActionProc with the rest of the arguments.\n\nI tested out something similar to this.  To shorten development time, I\nused TeleUSE's TuNinstallAccelerators resource to install the accelerators\non the shell, and I directly invoked the Open and Quit D actions instead\nof asking the pushbuttons to do it for me, but the more general approach I\ndescribed above should work.","label":"comp.windows.x"}

{"text":"Classify the following data: Some of your article was cut off on the right margin, but I will try\nand answer from what I can read.\n\nJudaism did not father Islam.  We had many of the same prophets, but\nJudaism ignores prophets later prophets including Jesus Christ (who\nChristians and Muslims believe in) and Mohammed.  The idea of believing\nin one God should unite all peoples.  However, note that Christianity\nand Islam reflect the fact that there are people with different views\nand the rights of non-Christians and non-Muslims are stated in each\nreligion.\n\n\nWe are supposed to pay 6% of our income after all necessities are\npaid.  Please note that this 6% is on a personal basis - if you are\npoor, there is no need to pay (quite the contrary, this money most\noften goes to the poor in each in country and to the poor Muslims\naround the world).  Also, this money is not required in the human\nsense (i.e. a Muslim never knocks at your door to ask for money\nand nobody makes a list at the mosque to make sure you have paid\n(and we surely don't pass money baskets around during our prayer\nservices)).\n\nGod's presence is certainly on Earth, but since God is everywhere,\nGod may show signs of existence in other places as well.  We can not\nsay for sure where God has shown signs of his existence and where\nhe has not/.\n\nThe Qur'an is not a copyright of the Taurah.  Muslims believe that\nthe Taurah, the Bible, and the Qur'an originally contained much the same\nmessage, thus the many similiarities.  However, the Taurah and the\nBible have been 'translated' into other languages which has changed\ntheir meaning over time (a translation also reflects some of the\npersonal views of the translator(s).  The Qur'an still exists in the\nsame language that it was revealed in - Arabic.  Therefore, we know\nthat mankind has not changed its meaning.  It is truly what was revealed\nto Mohammed at that time.  There are many scientific facts which\nwere not discovered by traditional scientific methods until much later\nsuch as the development of the baby in the mother's womb.\n\n\nOnly God knows for sure how it will turn out.  I hope it won't, but if\nthat happens, it was the will of God.\n\nPlease send this mail to me again so I can read the rest of what\nyou said.

Goaltending is about equal, top offensive players are about equal\n(Mogilny-LaFontaine vs. Oates-Juneau), but Buffalo has no answer to Neely\n(not to imply that Neely is not a top offensive player btw, in fact he's one\nof my favourites even though he's a damn Bruin :) ).  And the rest of the\nmatchup wrt lineup favours Boston anyway.  But I think it will go six.\n\n\nAgreed here...but Montreal will be pushed to the limit.  Is it just me, or\ndoes everything Montreal does in the playoffs come down to Roy?  Go Habs!!\n\nFinal\n\nI can't predict a Montreal victory because I've been watching them play for\n6 weeks and IMO they severly need some tougher players, especially to play\nin the Garden.  Last time they beat the B's 5-2 but Boston had a clear\nterritorial advantage; the victory was Roy's.  At the same time, I can't\nbring myself to predict the possibility of a loss, so I'll just say I will\nnot be putting money on this series. :-)\n\n\n\nAgreed.  NY doesn't have the goaltending to stop the onslaught, independent\nof the trouble they have given Pittsburgh this year.  Pens in five, which is\ncredit to NY.\n\n\nAgreed here too, but I think it will go at least six.  Jersey has a decent\nteam, and Washington has done poorly against the division this year.\n\n\nI think they will use Tabaracci more after Beaupre gets shelled.  I don't\nthink it will go six either...*maybe* five.\n\n\nIf Pittsburgh plays Boston, IMO they win in likely five, possibly six.  They\nown the Bruins.  If they play Montreal, I think it will go to seven, and once\nagain I won't be putting money on the seventh game.  I say seven because the\nHabs have played Pittsburgh very tough this season.\n\n\n\nChicago will win, but I think in at least six.  Chicago is not that good,\nIMO.  And remember that they take ridiculous numbers of penalties.\n\n\nVery true.  The Leafs have much to be proud of, but they will soon find out\nwhy Montreal did so lousy in the playoffs.  Toronto might win two or three \nat MLG though.  Wings in six, maybe even seven.\n\n\nIt _will_ be a war...possibly the most intense playoff series of them all. \nAnd yes, I think Detroit will win.  Probert will have to come up big though.\n\n\n\nOur first disagreement.  Canucks are playing like shit.  They don't use their\nsize *at* *all*, which may explain why they get hammered 8-1 by a team\nchasing them (Calgary)....Winnipeg in six.\n\n\nThis is also tough for me to call, because I haven't seen the Smythe enough. \nI don't think Roberts will be well enough to figure in, Coffey is a\nnon-issue, who cares what Carson has done before, and *never* underestimate\nGretzky.  LA in six.\n\n\nIf it is these two, Calgary will not need six games.  But I think it will be\nLA-Winnipeg anyway, and LA in seven, because of home ice.\n\n\nWow, must've been tough to go against your team.  But let's see, I picked\nLA-Detroit.  Detroit will win, probably in six.\n\n\nIf Pittsburgh plays Detroit, it will go longer than five, and I wouldn't bet\nagainst the Wings.  They are very strong, IMO, and nobody knows *how* strong\nbecause they've been underachieving most of the year.  If forced to choose,\nthough, I'd have to take the Penguins.\n\nA side note.  Vlad, last week you said that Selanne was a better player than\nGilmour.  NO WAY.  He is a more talented pure goal scorer...but aside from\nthe age difference, there is no way I would take him over Gilmour on my team.\nI'm not asking for flames, either, btw....I've spent more than enough time\narguing on behalf of Selanne and I still say he's a great player.  But while\nhe and Gilmour are both dangerous offensively (give Teemu an edge),\nGilmour *does* *it* *all*.  I know a lot of Gilmour-bashing goes on, esp.\nfrom Flame fans.  But IMO you guys are letting your dislike of Gilmour cloud\nyour judgement when it comes to his skill.  He is easily one of the best\nall-round players in the NHL.\n\n","label":"rec.sport.hockey"}

A system utilizing codes sent between users and banks\n  (similar to today's checking system except entirely digital) may\n  be one approach.  The issues of cryptography, privacy, and\n  anonymity are closely associated with transfer of cash in an\n  economy.  See the article in Scientific American by David Chaum\n  (~Dec.1992).\n\n  An experimental digital bank is run by Karl Barrus\n  <elee9sf@Menudo.UH.EDU> based on suggestions by Hal Finney on the\n  cypherpunks mailing list.  To use the server send mail to\n  elee7h5@rosebud.ee.uh.edu message with the following text:\n\n    ::\n    command: help\n    \n    user@host\n\n  where `user@host' is your email address.\n \n  \n_____\n<5.2> What is a ``hacker'' or ``cracker''?\n\n  These terms arouse strong feelings by many on their meaning,\n  especially on the internet.  In the general news media in the past\n  a person who uses computers and networks to malicious ends (such as\n  breaking into systems) has been referred to as a hacker, but most\n  internet users prefer the term ``cracker'' for this.  Instead, a\n  ``hacker'' is perceived as a benign but intensely ambitious,\n  curious, and driven computer user who explores obscure areas of a\n  system, for example---something of a proud electronic pioneer and\n  patriot.  This is the sense intended in this document.  See also\n  the ``Hacker's Dictionary'' and the FAQ `alt-security-faq'.\n \n \n_____\n<5.3> What is a ``cypherpunk''?\n\n  From the charter of the cypherpunk mailing list:\n\n  > Cypherpunks assume privacy is a good thing and wish there were\n  > more of it.  Cypherpunks acknowledge that those who want privacy\n  > must create it for themselves and not expect governments,\n  > corporations, or other large, faceless organizations to grant\n  > them privacy out of beneficence.  Cypherpunks know that people\n  > have been creating their own privacy for centuries with whispers,\n  > envelopes, closed doors, and couriers.  Cypherpunks do not seek\n  > to prevent other people from speaking about their experiences or\n  > their opinions.\n\n  See information on the cypherpunk mailing list below.\n\n  See also the CryptoAnarchist Manifesto and the Cryptography Glossary\n  in soda.berkeley.edu:/pub/cypherpunks.\n\n_____\n<5.4> What is `steganography' and anonymous pools?\n\n  Closely associated with encryption is `steganography' or the\n  techniques for not only pursuing private (encrypted) communication\n  but concealing the very  existence of the communication itself. \n  Many new possibilities in this area are introduced with the\n  proliferation of computer technology.  For example, it is possible\n  to encode messages in the least-significant bits of images,\n  typically the most 'noisy'. In addition, when such an item is\n  posted in a public place (such as a newsgroup), virtually\n  untraceable  communication can take place between sender and\n  receiver.  For  steganographic communications in the electronic\n  realm one another possibility is setting up a mailing list where\n  individual messages get broadcast to the entire list and individual\n  users decode particular messages with their unique key.   An\n  anonymous pool has been set up by Miron Cuperman\n  (miron@extropia.wimsey.com) for experiments.  Send email to\n  <pool0-request@extropia.wimsey.com>  with one of the following\n  commands in the subject line:\n\n    subscribe\n    unsubscribe\n    help\n\n_____\n<5.5> What is `security through obscurity'?\n\n  `Security through obscurity' refers to the attempt to gain\n  protection from system weaknesses by hiding sensitive information\n  or programs relating to them.  For example, a company may not make\n  public information on its software's encryption techniques to evade\n  `attacks' based on knowledge of it. Another example would be\n  concealing data on the existence of security holes or bugs in\n  operating systems.  Or, some reliance may be made on the fact that\n  some standard or mechanism with potential problems is serious\n  because they are ``not widely known'' or ``not widely used.'' This\n  argument is occasionally applied to mechanisms for email and Usenet\n  posting `forgery'. `Security through obscurity' is regarded as a\n  very feeble  technique at best and inappropriate and ineffective at\n  worst (also called the ``head-in-the-sand approach''). See the FAQ\n  for alt.security.  \n  \n  Some remarks of John Perry Barlow, cofounder of the Electronic\n  Frontier Foundation, directed to NSA agents at the First\n  International Symposium on National Security & National\n  Competitiveness held in McLean, Virginia  Dec. 1, 1992:\n\n  > Digitized information is very hard to stamp classified or keep\n  > contained. ... This stuff is incredibly leaky and volatile.  It's\n  > almost a life form in its ability to self-propagate.  If\n  > something hits the Net and it's something which people on there\n  > find interesting it will spread like a virus of the mind.  I\n  > believe you must simply accept the idea that we are moving into\n  > an environment where any information which is at all interesting\n  > to people is going to get out.  And there will be very little\n  > that you can do about it.  This is not a bad thing in my view,\n  > but you may differ...\n\n_____\n<5.6> What are `identity daemons'?\n  \n  RFC-931 describes a protocol standard that allows UNIX programs to\n  query a remote user's login name after connection to a local\n  communication socket (a connection of this type is established\n  during FTP and TELNET sessions, for example).  The standard is not\n  widely supported, perhaps 10% of internet sites currently implement\n  it but the number is increasing.  The mechanism is detrimental to\n  anonymity.  Regular users cannot disable it but system\n  adminstrators can circumvent it.  This standard may represent a\n  trend toward greater authentication mechanisms.\n\n_____\n<5.7> What new standards are needed to guard electronic privacy?\n\n\n  Remailing/Posting\n  -----------------\n  \n  - Stable, secure, protected, officially sanctioned and permitted,\n    publicly and privately operated anonymous servers and hubs.\n  - Official standards for encryption and anonymity in mail and USENET\n    postings.\n  - Truly anonymous protocols with source and destination information\n    obscured or absent and hidden routing mechanisms (chaining,\n    encrypted addresses, etc.)\n  - Standards for anonymous email addressing, embedding files, and\n    remailer site chaining.\n  \n  General\n  -------\n  \n  - Recognition of anonymity, cryptography, and related privacy\n    shields as legitimate, useful, desirable, and crucial by the\n    general public and their governments.\n  - Widespread use and implementation of these technologies \n    by systems designers into\n    hardware, software, and standards, implemented `securely,'\n    `seamlessly,' and `transparently'.\n  - General shift of use, dependence, and reliance to means other than\n    wiretapping and electronic surveillance by law enforcement\n    agencies.\n  - Publicity, retraction, and dissolution of laws and government\n    agencies opposed to privacy, replaced by structures dedicated to\n    strengthening and protecting it.\n\n\nISSUES\n======\n\n_____\n<6.1> What is the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF)?\n\n  From ftp.eff.org:/pub/EFF/mission_statement:\n\n  > A new world is arising in the vast web of digital, electronic\n  > media which connect us.

A highly publicized endeavor of the organization\n  involved the legal defense of  Steve Jackson Games after an FBI\n  raid and an accompanying civil suit  (see section on ``Steve\n  Jackson Games'').  The foundation publishes EFF News (EFFector\n  Online) electronically, send requests to effnews-request@eff.org.\n  \n  In a letter to Mitchell Kapor from the Chairman of the Subcommittee\n  with primary jurisdiction over telecommunications policy dated\n  November 5, 1991,  Representative  Edward J. Markey complemented\n  Mitchell Kapor on his ``insights on the development of a national\n  public information infrastructure'' which ``were appreciated greatly\n  by myself and the Members of the Subcommittee'' (complete text in \n  ftp.eff.com:/pub/pub-infra/1991-12):\n\n  > ...we need to pursue policies that encourage the Bell companies to\n  > work with other sectors of the communications industry to create\n  > a consumer-oriented, public information network.

The group has three offices (Palo Alto, Cambridge,\n  Washington, DC) and 20 chapters. It is involved in  litigation\n  against the FBI, The NSA, NIST, the Secret Service and other other\n  U.S. government agencies  to declassify and provide documentation\n  on issues such as Operation Sundevil, the FBI wiretap proposal,\n  NSA's interference in crypography, the breakup of the 2600 raid in\n  Arlington, Va in Nov 1992. Members speak frequently in front on\n  Congress, state legislators and public utility commissions to\n  testify on privacy, information policy, computer security, and\n  caller identification.\n\n  CPSR has created an extensive Internet Privacy library available\n  via FTP, Gopher, WAIS, and email at cpsr.org, currently comprising\n  the largest collection of privacy documents on the internet.  For\n  more information, anonymous FTP  cpsr.org:/cpsr/.\n\n\n  (Thanks to Dave Banisar <banisar@washofc.cpsr.org> for contributions\n  here.)\n\n_____\n<6.3> What was `Operation Sundevil' and the Steve Jackson Game case?\n\n  In the early 1990's a fear spread among U.S. law enforcement agencies\n  on the illicit activities of `hackers' and `phreakers' involved in\n  such activities as credit card fraud and long-distance call thievery.\n  \n  (see ftp.eff.org:/pub/SJG/General_Information/EFFector1.04):\n\n  > `Operation Sundevil,' the Phoenix-inspired crackdown of May\n  > 8,1990, concentrated on telephone code-fraud and credit-card\n  > abuse, and followed this seizure plan with some success. \n  > [Bulletin Board Systems] went down all over America, terrifying\n  > the underground and swiftly depriving them of at least some of\n  > their criminal instruments.  It also saddled analysts with some\n  > 24,000 floppy disks, and confronted harried Justice Department\n  > prosecutors with the daunting challenge of a gigantic nationwide\n  > hacker show-trial involving highly technical issues in dozens of\n  > jurisdictions.\n\n  Massive `show-trials' never materialized, although isolated\n  instances of prosecution were pursued.  The movement reached a\n  crescendo in Texas with the highly publicized case of illegal\n  search and seizure involving the Steve Jackson Games company of\n  Austin Texas on March 1, 1990.  From the column GURPS' LABOUR LOST\n  by Bruce Sterling <bruces@well.sf.ca.us> in Fantasy and Science\n  Fiction Magazine:\n\n  > In an early morning raid with an unlawful and unconstitutional\n  > warrant, agents of the Secret Service conducted a search of the\n  > SJG office.  When they left they took a manuscript being prepared\n  > for publication, private electronic mail, and several computers,\n  > including the hardware and software of the SJG Computer Bulletin\n  > Board System.  Yet Jackson and his business were not only\n  > innocent of any crime, but never suspects in the first place. \n  > The raid had been staged on the unfounded suspicion that\n  > somewhere in Jackson's office there `might be' a document\n  > compromising the security of the 911 telephone system.\n\n  FBI agents involved in the seizure were named in a civil suit filed\n  on behalf of Steve Jackson Games by The Electronic Frontier\n  Foundation.  See information on EFF below.  From an article by Joe\n  Abernathy in the Houston Chronicle ~Feb 1, 1993:\n  \n  > AUSTIN -- An electronic civil rights case against the Secret\n  > Service closed Thursday with a clear statement by federal\n  > District Judge Sam Sparks that the Service failed to conduct a\n  > proper investigation in a notorious computer crime crackdown,\n  > and went too far in retaining  custody of seized equipment. \n  > \n  > Secret Service Special Agent Timothy Foley of Chicago, who was in\n  > charge of three Austin computer search-and-seizures on March 1,\n  > 1990, that led to the lawsuit, stoically endured Spark's rebuke\n  > over the Service's poor investigation and abusive computer\n  > seizure policies.

S. Government has developed a microcircuit that not only\n   provides privacy through encryption that is substantially more robust\n   than the current government standard, but also permits escrowing of\n   the keys needed to unlock the encryption.  The system for the\n   escrowing of keys will allow the government to gain access to\n   encrypted information only with appropriate legal authorization.\nBut DES is strong enough that only the government can break it now,\nso the major effect is to make it EASIER for government to break!\n*At best* it makes it more difficult for the NSA to break, since they\nneed to get one of the two escrowed keys to do a brute-force search\nfor the other 40-bit key.\n\nSimilarly, it didn't say \"We're making encryption is commercially available.\"\nbecause encryption *is* already commercially available, including\nforms the NSA may not be able to break, like triple-DES or IDEA.\nAnd phone companies could offer DES-based systems *now* if they were\nconvinced the government would let them and they could make enough money.\n\nThe next thing it didn't say is \"We're making encryption legal\",\nbecause of course encryption *has always been* legal, and the\nPresident can't change the First Amendment merely by decree.\nWhat it *did* say was:\n\tIn making this decision, I do not intend to prevent the\n\tprivate sector from developing, or the government from approving,\n\tother microcircuits or algorithms that are equally effective in\n\tassuring both privacy and a secure key- escrow system.\nwhich clearly means \"We're making encryption illegal unless we get your keys.\nSoon.

{"text":"Classify the following data: I differ with our moderator on this.  I thought the whole idea of God coming\ndown to earth to live as one of us \"subject to sin and death\" (as one of\nthe consecration prayers in the Book of Common Prayer (1979) puts it) was\nthat Jesus was tempted, but did not succumb.  If sin is not part of the\nbasic definition of humanity, then Jesus \"fully human\" (Nicea) would not\nbe \"subject to sin\", but then the Resurrection loses some of its meaning,\nbecause we encounter our humanity most powerfully when we sin.  To distinguish\nbetween \"human\" and \"fallen human\" makes Jesus less like one of us at the\ntime we need him most.\n\n\nFirst, the Monophysites inherited none of Nestorius's version -- they \nwere on the opposite end of the spectrum from him.  Second, the historical\nrecord suggests that the positions attributed to Nestorius were not as\nextreme as his (successful) opponents (who wrote the conventional history)\nclaimed.  Mainly Nestorius opposed the term Theotokos for Mary, arguing\n(I think correctly) that a human could not be called Mother of God.  I mean,\nin the Athanasian Creed we talk about the Son \"uncreate\" -- surely even \nArians would concede that Jesus existed long before Mary.  Anyway, Nestorius's\nopponents claimed that by saying Mary was not Theotokos, that he claimed\nthat she only gave birth to the human nature of Jesus, which would require\ntwo seperate and distinct natures.  The argument fails though, because\nMary simply gave birth to Jesus, who preexisted her either divinely,\nif you accept \"Nestorianism\" as commonly defined, or both natures intertwined,\na la Chalcedon.\n\nSecond, I am not sure that \"Nestorianism\" is not a better alternative than\nthe orthodox view.  After all, I find it hard to believe that pre-Incarnation\nthat Jesus's human nature was in heaven; likewise post-Ascension.  I think\nrather that God came to earth and took our nature upon him.  It was a seperate\nnature, capable of being tempted as in Gethsemane (since I believe the divine\nnature could never be tempted) but in its moments of weakness the divine nature\nprevailed.\n\nComments on the above warmly appreciated.\n\nJason Albert\n\n[There may be differences in what we mean by \"subject to sin\".  The\noriginal complaint was from someone who didn't see how we could call\nJesus fully human, because he didn't sin.  I completely agree that\nJesus was subject to temptation.  I simply object to the idea that by\nnot succumbing, he is thereby not fully human.  I believe that you do\nnot have to sin in order to be human.\n\nI again apologize for confusing Nestorianism and monophysitism.  I\nagree with you, and have said elsewhere, that there's reason to think\nthat not everyone who is associated with heretical positions was in\nfact heretical.  There are scholars who maintain that Nestorius was\nnot Nestorian.  I have to confess that the first time I read some of\nthe correspondence between Nestorius and his opponents, I thought he\ngot the better of them.\n\nHowever, most scholars do believe that the work that eventually led to\nChalcedon was an advance, and that Nestorius was at the very least\n\"rash and dogmatic\" (as the editor of \"The Christological Controversy\"\nrefers to him) in rejecting all approaches other than his own.  As\nregular Usenet readers know, narrowness can be just as much an\nimpediment as being wrong.  Furthermore, he did say some things that I\nthink are problematical.  He responds to a rather mild letter from\nCyril with a flame worthy of Usenet.  In it he says \"To attribute also\nto [the Logos], in the name of [the incarnation] the characteristics\nof the flesh that has been conjoined with him ... is, my brother,\neither the work of a mind which truly errs in the fashion of the\nGreeks or that of a mind diseased with the insane heresy of Arius and\nApollinaris and the others.  Those who are thus carried away with the\nidea of this association are bound, because of it, to make the divine\nLogos have a part in being fed with milk and participate to some\ndegree in growh and stand in need of angelic assistance because of his\nfearfulness ...  These things are taken falsely when they are put off\non the deity and they become the occasion of just condemnation for us\nwho perpetrate the falsehood.\"\n\nIt's all well and good to maintain a proper distinction between\nhumanity and divinity.  But the whole concept of incarnation is based\non exactly the idea that the divine Logos does in fact have \"to some\ndegree\" a part in being born, growing up, and dying.  Of course it\nmust be understood that there's a certain indirectness in the Logos'\nparticipation in these things.  But there must be some sort of\nidentification between the divine and human, or we don't have an\nincarnation at all.  Nestorius seemed to think in black and white\nterms, and missed the sorts of nuances one needs to deal with this\narea.\n\nYou say \"I find it hard to believe that pre-Incarnation that Jesus's\nhuman nature was in heaven.\"  I don't think that's required by\northodox doctrine.  It's the divine Logos that is eternal.","label":"soc.religion.christian"}

The former is\noften referred to as the \"weak atheist\" position, and the latter as \"strong\natheism\".\n\nIt is important to note the difference between these two positions.  \"Weak\natheism\" is simple scepticism; disbelief in the existence of God.  \"Strong\natheism\" is a positive belief that God does not exist.  Please do not\nfall into the trap of assuming that all atheists are \"strong atheists\".\n\nSome atheists believe in the non-existence of all Gods; others limit their\natheism to specific Gods, such as the Christian God, rather than making\nflat-out denials.\n\n\"But isn't disbelieving in God the same thing as believing he doesn't exist?\"\n\nDefinitely not.  Disbelief in a proposition means that one does not believe\nit to be true.  Not believing that something is true is not equivalent to\nbelieving that it is false; one may simply have no idea whether it is true or\nnot.  Which brings us to agnosticism.\n\n\"What is agnosticism then?\"\n\nThe term 'agnosticism' was coined by Professor Huxley at a meeting of the\nMetaphysical Society in 1876.  He defined an agnostic as someone who\ndisclaimed (\"strong\") atheism and believed that the ultimate origin of things\nmust be some cause unknown and unknowable.\n\nThus an agnostic is someone who believes that we do not and cannot know for\nsure whether God exists.\n\nWords are slippery things, and language is inexact.  Beware of assuming that\nyou can work out someone's philosophical point of view simply from the fact\nthat she calls herself an atheist or an agnostic.  For example, many people\nuse agnosticism to mean \"weak atheism\", and use the word \"atheism\" only when\nreferring to \"strong atheism\".\n\nBeware also that because the word \"atheist\" has so many shades of meaning, it\nis very difficult to generalize about atheists.  About all you can say for\nsure is that atheists don't believe in God.  For example, it certainly isn't\nthe case that all atheists believe that science is the best way to find out\nabout the universe.\n\n\"So what is the philosophical justification or basis for atheism?\"\n\nThere are many philosophical justifications for atheism.  To find out why a\nparticular person chooses to be an atheist, it's best to ask her.\n\nMany atheists feel that the idea of God as presented by the major religions\nis essentially self-contradictory, and that it is logically impossible that\nsuch a God could exist.  Others are atheists through scepticism, because they\nsee no evidence that God exists.\n\n\"But isn't it impossible to prove the non-existence of something?\"\n\nThere are many counter-examples to such a statement.  For example, it is\nquite simple to prove that there does not exist a prime number larger than\nall other prime numbers.  Of course, this deals with well-defined objects\nobeying well-defined rules.  Whether Gods or universes are similarly\nwell-defined is a matter for debate.\n\nHowever, assuming for the moment that the existence of a God is not provably\nimpossible, there are still subtle reasons for assuming the non-existence of\nGod.  If we assume that something does not exist, it is always possible to\nshow that this assumption is invalid by finding a single counter-example.\n\nIf on the other hand we assume that something does exist, and if the thing in\nquestion is not provably impossible, showing that the assumption is invalid\nmay require an exhaustive search of all possible places where such a thing\nmight be found, to show that it isn't there.  Such an exhaustive search is\noften impractical or impossible.  There is no such problem with largest\nprimes, because we can prove that they don't exist.\n\nTherefore it is generally accepted that we must assume things do not exist\nunless we have evidence that they do.  Even theists follow this rule most of\nthe time; they don't believe in unicorns, even though they can't conclusively\nprove that no unicorns exist anywhere.\n\nTo assume that God exists is to make an assumption which probably cannot be\ntested.  We cannot make an exhaustive search of everywhere God might be to\nprove that he doesn't exist anywhere.  So the sceptical atheist assumes by\ndefault that God does not exist, since that is an assumption we can test.\n\nThose who profess strong atheism usually do not claim that no sort of God\nexists; instead, they generally restrict their claims so as to cover\nvarieties of God described by followers of various religions.  So whilst it\nmay be impossible to prove conclusively that no God exists, it may be\npossible to prove that (say) a God as described by a particular religious\nbook does not exist.  It may even be possible to prove that no God described\nby any present-day religion exists.\n\nIn practice, believing that no God described by any religion exists is very\nclose to believing that no God exists.  However, it is sufficiently different\nthat counter-arguments based on the impossibility of disproving every kind of\nGod are not really applicable.\n\n\"But what if God is essentially non-detectable?\"\n\nIf God interacts with our universe in any way, the effects of his interaction\nmust be measurable.  Hence his interaction with our universe must be\ndetectable.\n\nIf God is essentially non-detectable, it must therefore be the case that he\ndoes not interact with our universe in any way.  Many atheists would argue\nthat if God does not interact with our universe at all, it is of no\nimportance whether he exists or not.\n\nIf the Bible is to be believed, God was easily detectable by the Israelites.\nSurely he should still be detectable today?\n\nNote that I am not demanding that God interact in a scientifically\nverifiable, physical way.  It must surely be possible to perceive some\neffect caused by his presence, though; otherwise, how can I distinguish him\nfrom all the other things that don't exist?\n\n\"OK, you may think there's a philosophical justification for atheism, but\n isn't it still a religious belief?\"\n\nOne of the most common pastimes in philosophical discussion is \"the\nredefinition game\".  The cynical view of this game is as follows:\n\nPerson A begins by making a contentious statement.  When person B points out\nthat it can't be true, person A gradually re-defines the words he used in the\nstatement until he arrives at something person B is prepared to accept.  He\nthen records the statement, along with the fact that person B has agreed to\nit, and continues.  Eventually A uses the statement as an \"agreed fact\", but\nuses his original definitions of all the words in it rather than the obscure\nredefinitions originally needed to get B to agree to it.  Rather than be seen\nto be apparently inconsistent, B will tend to play along.\n\nThe point of this digression is that the answer to the question \"Isn't\natheism a religious belief?\" depends crucially upon what is meant by\n\"religious\".  \"Religion\" is generally characterized by belief in a superhuman\ncontrolling power -- especially in some sort of God -- and by faith and\nworship.\n\n[ It's worth pointing out in passing that some varieties of Buddhism are not\n  \"religion\" according to such a definition. ]\n\nAtheism is certainly not a belief in any sort of superhuman power, nor is it\ncategorized by worship in any meaningful sense.  Widening the definition of\n\"religious\" to encompass atheism tends to result in many other aspects of\nhuman behaviour suddenly becoming classed as \"religious\" as well -- such as\nscience, politics, and watching TV.\n\n\"OK, so it's not a religion.  But surely belief in atheism (or science) is\n still just an act of faith, like religion is?\"\n\nFirstly, it's not entirely clear that sceptical atheism is something one\nactually believes in.\n\nSecondly, it is necessary to adopt a number of core beliefs or assumptions to\nmake some sort of sense out of the sensory data we experience.  Most atheists\ntry to adopt as few core beliefs as possible; and even those are subject to\nquestioning if experience throws them into doubt.\n\nScience has a number of core assumptions.  For example, it is generally\nassumed that the laws of physics are the same for all observers.  These are\nthe sort of core assumptions atheists make.  If such basic ideas are called\n\"acts of faith\", then almost everything we know must be said to be based on\nacts of faith, and the term loses its meaning.\n\nFaith is more often used to refer to complete, certain belief in something.\nAccording to such a definition, atheism and science are certainly not acts of\nfaith.  Of course, individual atheists or scientists can be as dogmatic as\nreligious followers when claiming that something is \"certain\".  This is not a\ngeneral tendency, however; there are many atheists who would be reluctant to\nstate with certainty that the universe exists.\n\nFaith is also used to refer to belief without supporting evidence or proof.\nSceptical atheism certainly doesn't fit that definition, as sceptical atheism\nhas no beliefs.  Strong atheism is closer, but still doesn't really match, as\neven the most dogmatic atheist will tend to refer to experimental data (or\nthe lack of it) when asserting that God does not exist.\n\n\"If atheism is not religious, surely it's anti-religious?\"\n\nIt is an unfortunate human tendency to label everyone as either \"for\" or\n\"against\", \"friend\" or \"enemy\".  The truth is not so clear-cut.\n\nAtheism is the position that runs logically counter to theism; in that sense,\nit can be said to be \"anti-religion\".  However, when religious believers\nspeak of atheists being \"anti-religious\" they usually mean that the atheists\nhave some sort of antipathy or hatred towards theists.\n\nThis categorization of atheists as hostile towards religion is quite unfair.\nAtheist attitudes towards theists in fact cover a broad spectrum.\n\nMost atheists take a \"live and let live\" attitude.  Unless questioned, they\nwill not usually mention their atheism, except perhaps to close friends.  Of\ncourse, this may be in part because atheism is not \"socially acceptable\" in\nmany countries.\n\nA few atheists are quite anti-religious, and may even try to \"convert\" others\nwhen possible.  Historically, such anti-religious atheists have made little\nimpact on society outside the Eastern Bloc countries.\n\n(To digress slightly: the Soviet Union was originally dedicated to separation\nof church and state, just like the USA.  Soviet citizens were legally free to\nworship as they wished.  The institution of \"state atheism\" came about when\nStalin took control of the Soviet Union and tried to destroy the churches in\norder to gain complete power over the population.)\n\nSome atheists are quite vocal about their beliefs, but only where they see\nreligion encroaching on matters which are not its business -- for example,\nthe government of the USA.  Such individuals are usually concerned that\nchurch and state should remain separate.\n\n\"But if you don't allow religion to have a say in the running of the state,\n surely that's the same as state atheism?\"\n\nThe principle of the separation of church and state is that the state shall\nnot legislate concerning matters of religious belief.  In particular, it\nmeans not only that the state cannot promote one religion at the expense of\nanother, but also that it cannot promote any belief which is religious in\nnature.\n\nReligions can still have a say in discussion of purely secular matters.  For\nexample, religious believers have historically been responsible for\nencouraging many political reforms.  Even today, many organizations\ncampaigning for an increase in spending on foreign aid are founded as\nreligious campaigns.  So long as they campaign concerning secular matters,\nand so long as they do not discriminate on religious grounds, most atheists\nare quite happy to see them have their say.\n\n\"What about prayer in schools? If there's no God, why do you care if people\n pray?\"\n\nBecause people who do pray are voters and lawmakers, and tend to do things\nthat those who don't pray can't just ignore.  Also, Christian prayer in\nschools is intimidating to non-Christians, even if they are told that they\nneed not join in.  The diversity of religious and non-religious belief means\nthat it is impossible to formulate a meaningful prayer that will be\nacceptable to all those present at any public event.\n\nAlso, non-prayers tend to have friends and family who pray.  It is reasonable\nto care about friends and family wasting their time, even without other\nmotives.\n\n\"You mentioned Christians who campaign for increased foreign aid.  What about\n atheists?  Why aren't there any atheist charities or hospitals?  Don't\n atheists object to the religious charities?\"\n\nThere are many charities without religious purpose that atheists can\ncontribute to.  Some atheists contribute to religious charities as well, for\nthe sake of the practical good they do.  Some atheists even do voluntary work\nfor charities founded on a theistic basis.\n\nMost atheists seem to feel that atheism isn't worth shouting about in\nconnection with charity.  To them, atheism is just a simple, obvious everyday\nmatter, and so is charity.  Many feel that it's somewhat cheap, not to say\nself-righteous, to use simple charity as an excuse to plug a particular set\nof religious beliefs.\n\nTo \"weak\" atheists, building a hospital to say \"I do not believe in God\" is a\nrather strange idea; it's rather like holding a party to say \"Today is not my\nbirthday\".  Why the fuss?  Atheism is rarely evangelical.\n\n\"You said atheism isn't anti-religious.  But is it perhaps a backlash against\n one's upbringing, a way of rebelling?\"\n\nPerhaps it is, for some.  But many people have parents who do not attempt to\nforce any religious (or atheist) ideas upon them, and many of those people\nchoose to call themselves atheists.\n\nIt's also doubtless the case that some religious people chose religion as a\nbacklash against an atheist upbringing, as a way of being different.  On the\nother hand, many people choose religion as a way of conforming to the\nexpectations of others.\n\nOn the whole, we can't conclude much about whether atheism or religion are\nbacklash or conformism; although in general, people have a tendency to go\nalong with a group rather than act or think independently.\n\n\"How do atheists differ from religious people?\"\n\nThey don't believe in God.  That's all there is to it.\n\nAtheists may listen to heavy metal -- backwards, even -- or they may prefer a\nVerdi Requiem, even if they know the words.  They may wear Hawaiian shirts,\nthey may dress all in black, they may even wear orange robes.  (Many\nBuddhists lack a belief in any sort of God.)  Some atheists even carry a copy\nof the Bible around -- for arguing against, of course!\n\nWhoever you are, the chances are you have met several atheists without\nrealising it.  Atheists are usually unexceptional in behaviour and\nappearance.\n\n\"Unexceptional? But aren't atheists less moral than religious people?\"\n\nThat depends.  If you define morality as obedience to God, then of course\natheists are less moral as they don't obey any God.  But usually when one\ntalks of morality, one talks of what is acceptable (\"right\") and unacceptable\n(\"wrong\") behaviour within society.\n\nHumans are social animals, and to be maximally successful they must\nco-operate with each other.  This is a good enough reason to discourage most\natheists from \"anti-social\" or \"immoral\" behaviour, purely for the purposes\nof self-preservation.\n\nMany atheists behave in a \"moral\" or \"compassionate\" way simply because they\nfeel a natural tendency to empathize with other humans.  So why do they care\nwhat happens to others?  They don't know, they simply are that way.\n\nNaturally, there are some people who behave \"immorally\" and try to use\natheism to justify their actions.  However, there are equally many people who\nbehave \"immorally\" and then try to use religious beliefs to justify their\nactions.  For example:\n\n  \"Here is a trustworthy saying that deserves full acceptance: Jesus Christ\n   came into the world to save sinners...  But for that very reason, I was\n   shown mercy so that in me...  Jesus Christ might display His unlimited\n   patience as an example for those who would believe in him and receive\n   eternal life.  Now to the king eternal, immortal, invisible, the only God,\n   be honor and glory forever and ever.\"\n\nThe above quote is from a statement made to the court on February 17th 1992\nby Jeffrey Dahmer, the notorious cannibal serial killer of Milwaukee,\nWisconsin.  It seems that for every atheist mass-murderer, there is a\nreligious mass-murderer.  But what of more trivial morality?\n\n   A survey conducted by the Roper Organization found that behavior\n   deteriorated after \"born again\" experiences.  While only 4% of respondents\n   said they had driven intoxicated before being \"born again,\" 12% had done\n   so after conversion.  Similarly, 5% had used illegal drugs before\n   conversion, 9% after.  Two percent admitted to engaging in illicit sex\n   before salvation; 5% after.\n                                [\"Freethought Today\", September 1991, p. 12.]\n\nSo it seems that at best, religion does not have a monopoly on moral\nbehaviour.\n\n\"Is there such a thing as atheist morality?\"\n\nIf you mean \"Is there such a thing as morality for atheists?\", then the\nanswer is yes, as explained above.  Many atheists have ideas about morality\nwhich are at least as strong as those held by religious people.\n\nIf you mean \"Does atheism have a characteristic moral code?\", then the answer\nis no.  Atheism by itself does not imply anything much about how a person\nwill behave.  Most atheists follow many of the same \"moral rules\" as theists,\nbut for different reasons.  Atheists view morality as something created by\nhumans, according to the way humans feel the world 'ought' to work, rather\nthan seeing it as a set of rules decreed by a supernatural being.\n\n\"Then aren't atheists just theists who are denying God?\"\n\nA study by the Freedom From Religion Foundation found that over 90% of the\natheists who responded became atheists because religion did not work for\nthem.  They had found that religious beliefs were fundamentally incompatible\nwith what they observed around them.\n\nAtheists are not unbelievers through ignorance or denial; they are\nunbelievers through choice.  The vast majority of them have spent time\nstudying one or more religions, sometimes in very great depth.  They have\nmade a careful and considered decision to reject religious beliefs.\n\nThis decision may, of course, be an inevitable consequence of that\nindividual's personality.  For a naturally sceptical person, the choice\nof atheism is often the only one that makes sense, and hence the only\nchoice that person can honestly make.\n\n\"But don't atheists want to believe in God?\"\n\nAtheists live their lives as though there is nobody watching over them.  Many\nof them have no desire to be watched over, no matter how good-natured the\n\"Big Brother\" figure might be.\n\nSome atheists would like to be able to believe in God -- but so what? Should\none believe things merely because one wants them to be true?  The risks of\nsuch an approach should be obvious.  Atheists often decide that wanting to\nbelieve something is not enough; there must be evidence for the belief.\n\n\"But of course atheists see no evidence for the existence of God -- they are\n unwilling in their souls to see!\"\n\nMany, if not most atheists were previously religious.  As has been explained\nabove, the vast majority have seriously considered the possibility that God\nexists.  Many atheists have spent time in prayer trying to reach God.\n\nOf course, it is true that some atheists lack an open mind; but assuming that\nall atheists are biased and insincere is offensive and closed-minded.\nComments such as \"Of course God is there, you just aren't looking properly\"\nare likely to be viewed as patronizing.\n\nCertainly, if you wish to engage in philosophical debate with atheists it is\nvital that you give them the benefit of the doubt and assume that they are\nbeing sincere if they say that they have searched for God.  If you are not\nwilling to believe that they are basically telling the truth, debate is\nfutile.\n\n\"Isn't the whole of life completely pointless to an atheist?\"\n\nMany atheists live a purposeful life.  They decide what they think gives\nmeaning to life, and they pursue those goals.  They try to make their lives\ncount, not by wishing for eternal life, but by having an influence on other\npeople who will live on.  For example, an atheist may dedicate his life to\npolitical reform, in the hope of leaving his mark on history.\n\nIt is a natural human tendency to look for \"meaning\" or \"purpose\" in random\nevents.  However, it is by no means obvious that \"life\" is the sort of thing\nthat has a \"meaning\".\n\nTo put it another way, not everything which looks like a question is actually\na sensible thing to ask.  Some atheists believe that asking \"What is the\nmeaning of life?\" is as silly as asking \"What is the meaning of a cup of\ncoffee?\".  They believe that life has no purpose or meaning, it just is.\n\n\"So how do atheists find comfort in time of danger?\"\n\nThere are many ways of obtaining comfort; from family, friends, or even pets.\nOr on a less spiritual level, from food or drink or TV.\n\nThat may sound rather an empty and vulnerable way to face danger, but so\nwhat?  Should individuals believe in things because they are comforting, or\nshould they face reality no matter how harsh it might be?\n\nIn the end, it's a decision for the individual concerned.  Most atheists are\nunable to believe something they would not otherwise believe merely because\nit makes them feel comfortable.  They put truth before comfort, and consider\nthat if searching for truth sometimes makes them feel unhappy, that's just\nhard luck.\n\n\"Don't atheists worry that they might suddenly be shown to be wrong?\"\n\nThe short answer is \"No, do you?\"\n\nMany atheists have been atheists for years.  They have encountered many\narguments and much supposed evidence for the existence of God, but they have\nfound all of it to be invalid or inconclusive.\n\nThousands of years of religious belief haven't resulted in any good proof of\nthe existence of God.  Atheists therefore tend to feel that they are unlikely\nto be proved wrong in the immediate future, and they stop worrying about it.\n\n\"So why should theists question their beliefs? Don't the same arguments\n apply?\"\n\nNo, because the beliefs being questioned are not similar.  Weak atheism is\nthe sceptical \"default position\" to take; it asserts nothing.  Strong atheism\nis a negative belief.  Theism is a very strong positive belief.\n\nAtheists sometimes also argue that theists should question their beliefs\nbecause of the very real harm they can cause -- not just to the believers,\nbut to everyone else.\n\n\"What sort of harm?\"\n\nReligion represents a huge financial and work burden on mankind.  It's not\njust a matter of religious believers wasting their money on church buildings;\nthink of all the time and effort spent building churches, praying, and so on.\nImagine how that effort could be better spent.\n\nMany theists believe in miracle healing.  There have been plenty of instances\nof ill people being \"healed\" by a priest, ceasing to take the medicines\nprescribed to them by doctors, and dying as a result.  Some theists have died\nbecause they have refused blood transfusions on religious grounds.\n\nIt is arguable that the Catholic Church's opposition to birth control -- and\ncondoms in particular -- is increasing the problem of overpopulation in many\nthird-world countries and contributing to the spread of AIDS world-wide.\n\nReligious believers have been known to murder their children rather than\nallow their children to become atheists or marry someone of a different\nreligion.\n\n\"Those weren't REAL believers.  They just claimed to be believers as some\n sort of excuse.\"\n\nWhat makes a real believer?  There are so many One True Religions it's hard\nto tell.  Look at Christianity: there are many competing groups, all\nconvinced that they are the only true Christians.  Sometimes they even fight\nand kill each other.  How is an atheist supposed to decide who's a REAL\nChristian and who isn't, when even the major Christian churches like the\nCatholic Church and the Church of England can't decide amongst themselves?\n\nIn the end, most atheists take a pragmatic view, and decide that anyone who\ncalls himself a Christian, and uses Christian belief or dogma to justify his\nactions, should be considered a Christian.  Maybe some of those Christians\nare just perverting Christian teaching for their own ends -- but surely if\nthe Bible can be so readily used to support un-Christian acts it can't be\nmuch of a moral code? If the Bible is the word of God, why couldn't he have\nmade it less easy to misinterpret? And how do you know that your beliefs\naren't a perversion of what your God intended?\n\nIf there is no single unambiguous interpretation of the Bible, then why\nshould an atheist take one interpretation over another just on your say-so?\nSorry, but if someone claims that he believes in Jesus and that he murdered\nothers because Jesus and the Bible told him to do so, we must call him a\nChristian.\n\n\"Obviously those extreme sorts of beliefs should be questioned.  But since\n nobody has ever proved that God does not exist, it must be very unlikely\n that more basic religious beliefs, shared by all faiths, are nonsense.\"\n\nThat does not hold, because as was pointed out at the start of this dialogue,\npositive assertions concerning the existence of entities are inherently much\nharder to disprove than negative ones.  Nobody has ever proved that unicorns\ndon't exist, but that doesn't make it unlikely that they are myths.\n\nIt is therefore much more valid to hold a negative assertion by default than\nit is to hold a positive assertion by default.  Of course, \"weak\" atheists\nwould argue that asserting nothing is better still.\n\n\"Well, if atheism's so great, why are there so many theists?\"\n\nUnfortunately, the popularity of a belief has little to do with how \"correct\"\nit is, or whether it \"works\"; consider how many people believe in astrology,\ngraphology, and other pseudo-sciences.\n\nMany atheists feel that it is simply a human weakness to want to believe in\ngods.  Certainly in many primitive human societies, religion allows the\npeople to deal with phenomena that they do not adequately understand.\n\nOf course, there's more to religion than that.  In the industrialized world,\nwe find people believing in religious explanations of phenomena even when\nthere are perfectly adequate natural explanations.  Religion may have started\nas a means of attempting to explain the world, but nowadays it serves other\npurposes as well.\n\n\"But so many cultures have developed religions.  Surely that must say\n something?\"\n\nNot really.  Most religions are only superficially similar; for example, it's\nworth remembering that religions such as Buddhism and Taoism lack any sort of\nconcept of God in the Christian sense.\n\nOf course, most religions are quick to denounce competing religions, so it's\nrather odd to use one religion to try and justify another.\n\n\"What about all the famous scientists and philosophers who have concluded\n that God exists?\"\n\nFor every scientist or philosopher who believes in a god, there is one who\ndoes not.  Besides, as has already been pointed out, the truth of a belief is\nnot determined by how many people believe it.  Also, it is important to\nrealize that atheists do not view famous scientists or philosophers in the\nsame way that theists view their religious leaders.\n\nA famous scientist is only human; she may be an expert in some fields, but\nwhen she talks about other matters her words carry no special weight.  Many\nrespected scientists have made themselves look foolish by speaking on\nsubjects which lie outside their fields of expertise.\n\n\"So are you really saying that widespread belief in religion indicates\n nothing?\"\n\nNot entirely.  It certainly indicates that the religion in question has\nproperties which have helped it so spread so far.\n\nThe theory of memetics talks of \"memes\" -- sets of ideas which can propagate\nthemselves between human minds, by analogy with genes.  Some atheists view\nreligions as sets of particularly successful parasitic memes, which spread by\nencouraging their hosts to convert others.  Some memes avoid destruction by\ndiscouraging believers from questioning doctrine, or by using peer pressure\nto keep one-time believers from admitting that they were mistaken.  Some\nreligious memes even encourage their hosts to destroy hosts controlled by\nother memes.\n\nOf course, in the memetic view there is no particular virtue associated with\nsuccessful propagation of a meme.  Religion is not a good thing because of\nthe number of people who believe it, any more than a disease is a good thing\nbecause of the number of people who have caught it.\n\n\"Even if religion is not entirely true, at least it puts across important\n messages.  What are the fundamental messages of atheism?\"\n\nThere are many important ideas atheists promote.  The following are just a\nfew of them; don't be surprised to see ideas which are also present in some\nreligions.\n\n   There is more to moral behaviour than mindlessly following rules.\n\n   Be especially sceptical of positive claims.\n\n   If you want your life to have some sort of meaning, it's up to you to\n   find it.\n\n   Search for what is true, even if it makes you uncomfortable.\n\n   Make the most of your life, as it's probably the only one you'll have.\n\n   It's no good relying on some external power to change you; you must change\n   yourself.\n\n   Just because something's popular doesn't mean it's good.\n\n   If you must assume something, assume something it's easy to test.\n\n   Don't believe things just because you want them to be true.\n\nand finally (and most importantly):\n\n   All beliefs should be open to question.\n\nThanks for taking the time to read this article.\n\n\nmathew\n\n-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----\nVersion: 2.2\n\niQCVAgUBK8AjRXzXN+VrOblFAQFSbwP+MHePY4g7ge8Mo5wpsivX+kHYYxMErFAO\n7ltVtMVTu66Nz6sBbPw9QkbjArbY/S2sZ9NF5htdii0R6SsEyPl0R6/9bV9okE/q\nnihqnzXE8pGvLt7tlez4EoeHZjXLEFrdEyPVayT54yQqGb4HARbOEHDcrTe2atmP\nq0Z4hSSPpAU=\n=q2V5\n-----END PGP SIGNATURE-----","label":"alt.atheism"}

{"text":"Classify the following data: I would like to share with netters a few points I picked up from the PBS\n    Frontline program regarding Iran's nuclear activities, aired on Tuesday\n    April 13. For the sake of brevity, I'll present them in some separate\n    points.\n\n    1- As many other western programs, this program was laid on a bed of\n    misinformation throughout the program, to maximize the effect of the\n    program on the viewer. Some of the misinformations were as follows:\n\n    - It was alleged that:\" Late Imam Khomeini objected to Shah's technological\n    advancements as anti-Islamic, but now things have changed and the proof of\n    change is that some Iranian merchants are now selling personal computers. \"!\n    These are the most ridiculous lies, one can make about the objectives \n    of the Islamic Revolution in toppling the Shah and state of the technology\n    in Iran after revolution.\n\n    -Iran was equally accused of using chemical weapons against Iraqi aggressors\n    while there has never been any proof in this regard, and nobody has seen\n    Iraqi soldiers or civilians injured by Iranian chemical weapons, in\n    contrary to what the whole world has seen about Iranian soldiers and\n    civilians, injured by Iraqi chemical weapons.\n\n    - While the number of martyrs during the sacred defense against Iraqi\n    aggression has been officially announced to be about 117,000 and even most\n    radical counter-revolutionary groups claim that Iran and Iraq had a total\n    of one million dead, this program claims that Iran alone has one million\n    dead left from the war.\n\n    - The translation of Iranian officials' talks are not 100% true. For\n    example when Iranian head of Atomic Energy says that: \" It hurts me to\n    see that Iran is the subject of these unfriendly propaganda.\" The \n    research.\"!\n\n    2- Almost all alleged devices or material bought or planned to be bought\n    by Iranians were of countless dual usage, while the program tries to \n    undermine their non-military uses, without any reference to Iran's\n    big population and its inevitable need to other sources of energy in\n    near future and its current deficit in electrical power.\n\n    3- The whole program is trying to show the Sharif University of \n    Technology as a nuclear research center, while even the cameramen of the\n    program know well that in a country like Iran without a so tightly closed\n    society no one can make a nuclear bomb in a university! Taking in account\n    the scientific advancement of Sharif U. in engineering fields and its\n    potential role in improvement of Iran's industries and eventually the\n    lives of people, it is obvious that they are persuading other countries\n    to prevent them from further helping this university or other ones\n    in scientific and industrial efforts.\n\n    4- A key point in program's justifications is trying to disvalidate as\n    much as possible all efforts done by IAEA [*] in their numerous visits from\n    Iran's different sites. They say: \"We are not sure if the places visited\n    by IAEA are the real ones or not\" !, or \" We can not rely on IAEA's\n    reports and observation, because they failed to see Iraq's nuclear\n    activities before\" as if they didn't know that Iraq was trying to build\n    nuclear weapons!\n\n    5- As an extremely personal opinion, the most disgusting aspect of the\n    program was the arrogance of the member of US Senate foreign Affairs,\n    William Triplet, in his way of talking, as if he was the god talking\n    from the absolute knowledge!\n\n       I hope all Iranians be aware of the gradual buildup against their\n    country in western media, and I hope Iranian authorities continue to\n    their wise and calculated approach with regard to international affairs\n    and peaceful coexistence with friendly nations.\n\n\nMohammad\n","label":"talk.politics.mideast"}

{"text":"Classify the following data: In responding to the post below I have considered issues far outside the\nscope of revisionism and principally have considered the political\nimplications of a racist ideology and its inevitable outcome. Thus it\nis tangentially relevant to soc.history and alt.revisionism but I have directed\nfollowups to t.p.m since it is principally consideration of the political\nlessons to be drawn from the history of the NAZI party that I deal with.\n\n\n\n\nLet us assume for the sake of argument that this was indeed the case? Does\nthis mean that Hilter would have been in any way less guilty of mass murder\nbecause he aquiesced rather than participated as an active and ardent\nsupporter?\n\nOne of the important things to realise about the NAZIs is that the system\nwas far more evil than any single member. Once created the NAZI party\nitself was a murder machine that would inevitably commit genocide, there was\nnoone within it strong enough to prevent it. Remember that Hitler did not\noriginaly lead the NAZI party nor was he particularly powerful within it\nuntil his oratory allowed the party to come to power. Had Hitler reneged\nupon the emotiaonal expectations which he had created within the ranks of \nhis supporters he would have been replaced as he had himself replaced the\nold guard who he beleived were unable to grasp the intellectual implications\nof their rhetoric. \n\nThis is why all parties that espouse NAZI style race supremacy ideologies must\nbe considered as dangerous and as evil as the NAZIs. The idea that one \"race\"\nof people is inherently superior to another and that the greatest goal of\nhumanity is to achieve racial perfection has only one logical outcome,\nthe gas chambers of Auschwitz.\n\nThe NAZI party is not simply the tale of a supremely evil single man who\nlead an entire country astray, beyond the evil of individuals there was the\nevil of the system itself which was self generating and self perpetuating.\nHitler was an extreemly evil person who built his party arround an ego\ncult centered on the demonstration of his own power, this does not however\nmean that he was as entirely free from political constraints as he and\nhis propagandists worked so hard to assert. The myth that racism can\nproduce a strong government that can cure a nations ills must be \nemphatically rejected. In the same way we must accept a distinction between\na govenrment that demonstrates its strength and one that is able to \ngovern decisively in the manner it beleives is best. I would accept only the\nlatter as a \"strong\" government since most displays of strength are made\nnecessary by an essential weakness.\n\nIt is important to understand that the NAZIs were not stupid nor were they\namoral in the sense that they lacked moral scruples. They acted in the\nsame manner as the Spanish Inquisition - murder and torture in the cause\nof morality. The fault of the NAZIs lies in their axioms, not in their\nlogic nor in their implementation of those axioms. Thus all such parties\nsuch as the National Front or David Dukes Klu Klux Klan front who assert\nthe truth of those axioms must be considered for what they are, advocates\nof a system that would commit genocide. \n\nThe conclusion that Hitler was not only responsible but imensely evil is\ninescapable from the historical record. It is important though to not let\nthe conclusion be reached that the NAZIs espoused a set of ideas that\nwere basically correct but had an unfortunate proponent. The evils of\nthe concept of race supremacy are primary. Although this most emphaticaly\ndoes not excuse individual culpability this is nevertheless secondary.\n\nNo matter what the promises made by a racist, supremacist party upon \nelection those promises will be broken as soon as circumstances permit.\nIf this requires the replacement of the leaders that originally made\nthe pledges, that will occur. Hatred is a supreme justifier. It also creates\na dynamic of its own when those in government allow it reign. For many\nin government politics is a method of providing a justification for\ntheir own existence through a demonstration of their importance. A \nrhetoric of hatred inevitably develops the question of action since the\ncontinued existence of an object of hatred is inevitably a reminder of the\nessential impotence of the politician. Thus we have the US raid on Tripoli\nwhich has little purpose beyond a demonstration of power. It is important\nto realise that there is no quantum jump between the politics of the right\nand those of the extreeme right but a progression from the reinforcement\nof popular predjudice to action being taken on the basis of that predjudice.\nIn the same way the extreeme left trace their route to despotism through\ntheir assertion of the subjugation of the individual to ideology.\n\nIt is important though that in attempting to understand the dynamics\nof political systems that this is not used to excuse the participants. The\nleaders of a nation take on a supreme moral burden but not only do\nso voluntarily are required to stive to do so. Thus to take on such a \ntask without a fundamental examination of the logical progression of\nones set of axioms to its conclusion in itself is a moral crime. Furthermore\nin taking on such a duty one is obliged to put the interest of the whole\nbefore personal concerns, even of personal security.\n\nAlthough it was inevitable that a party such as the NAZIs, based upon hatred\nand an idolisation of the symbols of power should have saught to commit\ngenocide it was not inevitable that they should succeeded. Each member of\nthe system had an ability to create a change within it that had a possibility\nof changing the dynamic. Realising that the individual cannot hope to \ncontrol a system does not mean accepting that the individual cannot \naffect the system.\n","label":"talk.politics.misc"}

Not a chance.\n\n The SUNDAY TIMES 8 March 1992\n Morgues fill as Azeris head for all-out war\n -------------------------------------------\n Thomas Goltz, the first to report the massacre by Armenian soldiers in\n the worst violence since the breakup of the Soviet Union, reports from\n Agdam\n ------\n Khojaly used to be a barren town, with empty shops and treeless dirt\n roads. Yet it was still home to thousands of people who, in happier\n times, tended fields and flocks of geese. Last week it was wiped off\n the map.\n .......\n As sickening reports trickled in to the Azerbaijani border town of\n Agdam, and the bodies piled up in the morgues, there was little doubt\n that Khojaly and the stark foothills and gullies around it had been\n the site of the most terrible massacre since the Soviet Union broke\n apart.\n .......\n I was the last Westerner to visit Khojaly. That was in january and\n people were predicting their fate with grim resignation. Zumrut Ezoya,\n a mother of four on board the helicopter that ferried us into the\n town, called her community \"sitting ducks, ready to get shot\". She and\n her family were among the victims of the massacre on February 26.\n .......\n \"The Armenians have taken all the outlying villages, one by one, and\n the government does nothing.\" Balakisi Sakikov, 55, a father of five,\n said. \"Next they will drive us out or kill us all,\" said Dilbar, his\n wife. The couple, their three sons and three daughters were killed in\n the assault, as were many other people I had spoken to.\n ......\n \"It was close to the Armenian lines we knew we would have to cross.\n There was a road, and the first units of the column ran across then\n all hell broke loose. Bullets were raining down from all sides. we had\n just entered their trap.\"\n The azeri defenders picked off one by one. Survivors say that Armenian\n forces then began a pitiless slaughter, firing at anything moved in\n the gullies. A video taken by an azeri cameraman, wailing and crying\n as he filmed body after body, showed a grizzly trail of death leading\n towards higher, forested ground where the villagers had sought refuge\n from the Armenians.\n \"The Armenians just shot and shot and shot,\" said Omar Veyselov, lying\n in hospital in Agdam with sharapnel wounds. \"I saw my wife and\n daughter fall right by me.\"\n People wandered through the hospital corridors looking for news of the\n loved ones. Some vented their fury on foreigners: \" Where is my\n daughter, where is my son ?\" wailed a mother. \"Raped. Butchered. Lost.\"\n Azerbaijan has said as many as 1,000 refugees were killed as they\n tried to flee. The Armenians have denied this, saying the civilians\n were caught in \"crossfire\".\n .......\n\nSource: The Times, 2 March 1992.\n\nCORPSES LITTER HILLS IN KARABAKH\n\nANATOL LIEVEN COMES UNDER FIRE WHILE FLYING WITH AZERBAIJANI FORCES TO \nINVESTIGATE THE ALLEGED MASS KILLINGS OF REFUGEES BY ARMENIAN TROOPS...\n\nAs we swooped low over the snow-covered hills of Nagorno-Karabagh we saw \nthe scattered corpses. Apparently, the refugees had been shot down as \nthey ran. An Azerbaijani film of the places we flew over, shown to \njournalists afterwards, showed DOZENS OF CORPSES lying in various parts \nof the hills.\n\nThe Azerbaijanis claim that AS MANY AS 1000 have died in a MASS KILLING \nof AZERBAIJANIS fleeing from the town of Khodjaly, seized by Armenians \nlast week. A further 4,000 are believed to be wounded, frozen to death \nor missing... \n\nSeven of us squatted in the cabin of an Azerbaijani M24 attack helicopter \nas we flew to investigate the claims of the mass killings. Suddenly there \nwas a thump against the underside of the aircraft, a red flash of tracer \nripped past the starboard wing, and the helicopter rocked sharply. We \nswung round, and there was a deafening burst of fire from the cannon \nunder our wing as the helicopter crew returned fire.\n\nWe had been fired on from an Armenian anti-aircraft post. We swung round \nagain, tipped to starboard and appeared to dive straight down into a \nvalley. The brown earth swooped around our heads, the helicopter swung \nround again and followed the contours of the ground. Our cannon fired \nrepeated blasts.\n\nLater it emerged that a civilian helicopter that we had been escorting \nhad landed successfully at Nakhichevanik in the east of the disputed \nenclave of Nagorno-Karabakh, to pick up some of the dead. We had, in \nfact, been attacked both by ground fire and by an Armenian helicopter. \nI had seen the Armenian helicopter intermittently through the window, \nits cannons firing, but had thought - mistakenly - that it was on \n\"our side\". Our group of Western journalists had embarked on a \nsearch-and-rescue flight that had become a combat mission.\n\nOur flight consisted of the civilian passenger helicopter and two \nM24 Soviet attack helicopters in the Azerbaijani service, nicknamed \nflying crocodiles for their armour. Our party was in the second \ncrocodile. The civilian helicopter's job was to land in the mountains \nand pick up bodies at sites of the mass killings. The attack helicopters \nwere there to give covering fire if necessary.\n\nThe operation showed a striking sign of the disintegration of the Soviet \narmed forces because our pilot was a Russian officer. An Azerbaijani \nofficial told us that there were now five former Soviet military \nhelicopters -and their pilots- fighting for Azerbaijan. \"They have \nsigned contracts to fly for us,\" he said. The helicopter we engaged \nin combat was most probably flown by a brother-officer of our Russian \npilot, but fighting for the Armenians.\n\nWe had taken off just before 5pm on Saturday from Agdam airfield, an \nheated for the Armenian-controlled mountains of Karabakh, a sheer \nwhite wall in the distance. The civilian helicopter picked up four \ncorpses, and it was during this and a previous mission that an \nAzerbaijani cameraman filmed the several the several dozen bodies \non the hillsides. We then took off again in a hurry and speed back \ntowards Azerbaijani lines. Azerbaijani gunners on the last hill before \nthe plain - and safety - gazed up at us as we passed.\n\nBack at the airfield in Agdam, we took a look the bodies the \ncivilian helicopter had picked up. Two old men a small girl were \ncovered with blood, their limbs contorted by the cold and rigor \nmortis. They had been shot.\n\nWhat did our Russian pilot think of the tragedy, our close shave, \nand the war in Nagorno-Karabakh? He gave us CHEERFUL GRIN, POLITELY \nDECLINED TO ANSWER QUES TIONS, AND MARCHED OFF TO HIS DINNER.\n\nSerdar Argic","label":"talk.politics.mideast"}

{"text":"Classify the following data: \nGawd, I love Windows :-)\n\n\nYou'll probably want to delete any damaged executables and reload them\nfresh.  Data files should be examined and repaired.\n\n\nYou're not stupid.  Smartdrive caches things, and Windows also runs a\nswap file which may contain data also.  All of this is pretty risky\nstuff in a PC environment.\n\n\nA reasonably accurate prediction...\n\n\nHere's a brief description of how DOS stores files:\n\nThere are three pieces to a file.  The directory entry, the FAT chain,\nand the data area.  You can think of these as a sheet of lined\nnotebook paper, a sheet of graph paper, and a stack of 3X5 cards.\n\nThe directory entry (notebook paper) holds the file name, actual size,\nand first cluster number.  It also holds some other information that's not\nimportant right now.\n\nThe File Allocation Table (FAT) chain (graph paper) tells where to find\nthe actual data.  Each square of graph paper holds a number.  If the\nnumber is zero, the cluster associated with this box is available.  If it\nholds a \"magic\" number, it is either the last piece of a file or a bad\n(unuseable) spot on the disk.  Any other number tells which cluster\ncontains the next section of the file.\n\nThe data area (3X5 cards) is where the actual information is stored.\nThe data area is organized as clusters of a fixed size; storage is\ndoled out in \"chunks\" of one cluster each.  (In your case, one cluster\nis 2048 bytes.)  As a cluster is filled, another is allocated.\n\nTo read a file, you first look at the directory entry to get the\nstarting cluster number.  Now you read the data from that cluster.\nNext, look at the FAT entry for the cluster you just read.  This will\ntell you the cluster number for the next chunk of the file.\nNaturally, these numbers are usually sequential, but they can jump\naround and even go backwards.  Continue reading, one cluster at a\ntime, as you walk this chain through the FAT, until you hit the marker\nwhich says it's the last cluster in the file.\n\nCHKDSK is the DOS utility that checks the sanity and coherence of\nthe directories and the FAT and can bludgeon most flaws into\nsubmission.  It doesn't have any intelligence, so you have to\ndouble-check anything it \"fixes\".\n\nNow let's do a bit of a post-mortem:\n\n\nAll of these files have sizes (according to the FAT) which don't match\nthe size reported in their directory entries.  CHKDSK /F will alter\nthe directory entries to match the FAT size.  (In other words,   the\ndirectory entry for CVPIC.EXE may say the file is 64,877 bytes long.\nBut CHKDSK found a FAT chain of 43 clusters attached to it.  (My numbers,\nobviously, are made up.))\n\n\nDisk space was found which is allocated in the FAT, but is not attached\nto any directory entry.  CHKDSK /F gives you the option of converting these\n\"lost chains\" to files.  You can then examine the files (FILE0000.CHK\nthrough FILE0223.CHK) and rename or discard them.  Or, if you tell\nCHKDSK _not_ to convert them to files, then those clusters will simply\nbe marked \"available\" in the FAT.\n\n\n\n...\n\n\nThese files are both referencing the _same_ data cluster.  Obviously,\none of them (at least) must be wrong.  It's interesting to note that\nC:\\386SPART.PAR is your Windows swap file...\n\nTo fix this, you should copy each cross-linked file to a new name.\nThis will \"fix\" the cross-link by giving the files unique data spaces.\nNow delete the cross-linked files.  Examine the copies and try to\nassemble them properly.  Good luck.  (Hint:  \"Missing pieces\" are\nlikely to be found in those \"lost chains\" at the top...)\n\n\nYour disk is pretty close to full.  This may be the actual cause of\nthe problem; perhaps Windows needed to expand its swapfile by an\namount which exceeded available disk space...\n\nIn any case, the short summary is that something trashed your FAT.\nThere are utilities that can mirror your FAT and help repair damage\nafter something like this, but you have to run them _before_ the\nproblem occurs.  Sorry.\n\n\n-- \n----------------------------------------------------\nGordon S.

{"text":"Classify the following data: \n\nIf people are going to do this, I really wish they would tell me first.\nI'd be happy to go over the insert (in the PDR) with them and explain\neverything.  All too many patients read the insert and panic and then\non the next visit sheepishly admit they were afraid to take the drug\nand we are starting over again at square one.  Some of them probably\ndidn't even come back for followup because they didn't want to admit\nthey wouldn't take the drug or thought I was trying to kill them or\nsomething.  What people don't understand about the inserts is that they\nreport every adverse side effect ever reported, without substantiating\nthat the drug was responsible.  The insert is a legal document to slough\nliability from the manufacturer to the physician if something was to\nhappen.  If patients want to have the most useful and reliable information\non a drug they would be so much better off getting hold of one of the\nAMA drug evaluation books or something similar that is much more scientific.\nThere are very few drugs that someone hasn't reported a death from taking.\nPatients don't realize that and don't usually appreciate the risks\nto themselves properly.

{"text":"Classify the following data: \nThe sightings were apparently spurious.  There is no planet inside of\nthe orbit of Mercury.\n\nThe idea of Vulcan came from the differences between Mercury's observed\nperihelion precession and the value it should have had according to\nNewtonian physics.  Leverrier made an extensive set of observations\nand calculations during the mid 19th century, and Simon Newcombe later\nimproved on the observations and re-calculated using Leverrier's system\nof equations.  Now Leverrier was one of the co-discoverers of Neptune\nand since he had predicted its existence based on anomalies in the orbit\nof Uranus his inclination was to believe the same sort of thing was\nafoot with Mercury.\n\nBut alas, 'twere not so.  Mercury's perihelion precesses at the rate\nit does because the space where it resides near the sun is significantly\ncurved due to the sun's mass.  This explanation had to wait until 1915\nand Albert Einstein's synthesis of his earlier theory of the electrodynamics\nof moving bodies (commonly called Special Relativity) with Reimanian \ngeometry.

{"text":"Classify the following data: \n\nI will answer this as I find time.\n\n\nNotice what I said about this book.  I called it \"Easy reading.\"  The reason I\ndropped philosphy as my major was because I ran into too many pharisaical\nSimon's.  I don't know how many walking encyclopedia's I ran across in\nphilosphy classes.  The problem isn't in knowing sooooo much more than your\naverage lay person, the problem comes when you become puffed up about it. \nSchaeffer is just fine for the average lay person.  That was who he was\nwritting to.  I suppose that you would have criticised John that his gospel was\nto simple.  I've talked with Schaeffer one on one.  I've been in lectures with\nthe man when he was being drilled by philosphy students and prof's from secular\nas well as Christian universities. (ND alone would fill both those catagories) \nHis answers were enough that the prof's themselves often were taken back and\ncaused to re-think what their question was.  I saw this time and time again at\ndifferent open forums.  So yes, Schaeffers books are by in large, well,\nsimplistic.  It certainly isn't grad level reading.  But we must get off our\nhigh horses when it comes to recommended reading.  Do you seriously think most\npeople would get through the first chapter of Wittgenstein?  I may have more to\nsay about this secular scientist at another time.\n\nAlso, one must finally get beyond the doubt caused by *insistent*\ninquisitiveness.  One cannot live his life constantly from a cartisian doubt\nbase.  \n\nLook, the Christian wholeheartedly supports genuine rationality.  But we must\nadd a qualification to give this balance.  Christianity is second to none in\nkeeping reason in its place.  We never know the value of a thing until we know\nits limits.  Put unlimited value on something and in the end you will exhaust\nit of all value!\n\nTHis is why Xianity is thoroughly rational but not the least bit rationalistic.\n It also explains the curious fact that it is rationalism, and not Christian\nfaith, which leads to irrationality.  If we forget the limits of a thing, we\nfly in the face of reality and condem ourselves to learn the simple ironic\nlesson of life: \n\n\"More without limits is less;  less with limits is more.\"  \n\nOr as I have so often stated it, freedom without form soon becomes form w/o\nfreedom.\n\nLet's put it another way.  The rationality of faith is implacably opposed to\nabsurdity but has no quarrel with mystery. Think about that.  It can tell the\ndifference between the two if you will let it.  Christianity's contention with\nrationalism is not that it has too much reason in it, but that it has very\nlittle else.  When a Christian comes to faith his understanding and his trust\ngo hand in hand, but as he continues in faith his trust may sometimes be called\nto go on by itself without his understanding.\n\nThis is where the principle of suspended judgment applies.  At such time if the\nChristian faith is to be itself and let God be God, it must suspend judgment\nand say, \"Father I do not understand you but I trust you.\"  Now don't read all\nyour objections of me into that statement.  I wasn't saying I do not understand\nyou at all, but I trust you anyway.\" It means that \"I do not understand You *in\nthis situation* but I do understand *why I trust You* anyway\"  Therefore I can\ntrust that you understand even though I do not. The former is a mystery\nunrelieved by rationality and indistinguishable from absurdity.  The latter is\na statement of rationality of faith walking hand in hand with the mystery of\nFaith.  So.... the principle of suspended judgment is not irrational.  It is\nnot a leap of faith but a walk of faith.  As believers we cannot always know\nwhy, but we canalways know why we trust God who knows why and this makes all\nthe difference.\n\nNow, there is one obvious snag to all this and this is where I have parted\ncompany with philosophy- what is eminently reasonable in theory is a rather bit\nmore difficult in practice.  In practice the pressure of mystery acts on faith\nlike the insistent \"whying\" of a 3 year old.  It isn't just that we would like\nto know what we do not know but that we feel we *must* know what we cannot\nknow.  The one produces frustration because curiosity is denied; the other\nleads to genuine anguish.  More specifically the poorer our understanding is in\ncoming to faith the more necessary it will be to understand everything after\ncoming to faith.  If we do not know why we trust God, then we will always need\nto know exactly what God is doing in order to trust him.  Failing to grasp\nthat, we may not be able to trust him, for anything we do not understand may\ncount decisevely against what we are able to trust.  \n\nIf, on the other hand, we do know why we trust God, we will be able to trust\nhim in situations where we do not understand what He is doing. (Too many Xian\nleaders teach as if the Christian had a window in the back of his head which\nallows for understanding at every foot fall)  For what God is doing may be\nambiguous, but it will not be inherently contradictory!  It may be mystery to\nus, but mystery is only inscrutable; what would be insufferable is absurdity.\nAnd that my friend, was the conclusion of Nietzche both in theory and in\npractice.

As to retaliation,\nwhile mistakes may be made, that is still a far cry from indiscriminate\nbombing, which would have produced major casualties.\n\n   Israel's retalliation policy is cold hearted, but a reality that\n   we have come to accept and deal with, the Lebanese Resistance\n   on the other hand is not going to stop its attacks on OCCUPYING \n   ISRAELI SOLDIERS until they withdraw, this is the only real \n   leverage that they have to force Israel to withdraw.\n\nWell, here we disagree.  I think that Israel would willingly withdraw if\nthe Lebanese gov't was able to field a reliable force in the area to police\nit and prevent further attacks.\n\n   This is the only realistic solution, it is time for Israel to\n   realize that the concept of a \"buffer zone\" aimed at protecting\n   its northern cities has failed.  In fact it has caused much more\n   Israeli deaths than the occasional shelling of Northern Israel\n   would have resulted in.  \n\nActually that is not clear at all.  I will agree that the death toll is no\nlonger civilian and now primarily military though.\n\n   There seems to be very little incentive for the Syrian and Lebanese\n   goovernment to allow Hizbollah to bomb Israel proper under such \n   circumstances, and now the Lebanese government has proven that it is\n   capable of controlling and disarming all militias as they did\n   in all other parts of Lebanon.\n\nNo, the Syrian gov't is more than happy to have Israel sink into another\nLebanese morass.  I could elaborate if necessary.\n\n   I agree, only in the case of the Isareli soldiers their killing\n   CANNOT be qualified as murder, no matter what you say.\n\nNo, but it is regretable, as is the whole situation.\n","label":"talk.politics.mideast"}

Very informative, well-balanced, and humanitarian\nwithout neglecting the need for scientific rigor.\n\n\n(Cross-posted to alt.psychology.personality since some personality typing\nwill be discussed at the beginning - Note: I've set all followups to sci.med\nsince most of my comments are more sci.med oriented and I'm sure most of the\nreplies, if any, will be med-related.)\n\n\n\n\nThey are just responding in their natural way:  Hyper-Choleric Syndrome (HCS).\nOops, that is not a recognized \"illness\" in the psychological community,\nbetter not say that since it therefore must not, and never will, exist.  :^)\n\nActually, it is fascinating that a disproportionate number of physicians\nwill type out as NT (for those not familiar with the Myers-Briggs system,\njust e-mail me and I'll send a summary file to you).  In the general\npopulation, NT's comprise only about 12% of the population, but among\nphysicians it is much much higher (I don't know the exact percentage -\nany help here a.p.p.er's?)\n\nOne driving characteristic of an NT, especially an NTJ, is their obvious\ncholeric behavior (driver, type A, etc.) - the extreme emotional need to\ncontrol, to lead, and/or to be the best or the most competent.  If they are\nalso extroverted, they are best described as \"Field Marshalls\".  This trait\nis very valuable and essential in our society - we need people who want to\nlead, to strive to overcome the elements, to seek and thirst for knowledge,\nto raise the level of competency, etc.  The great successes in science and\ntechnology are in large part due to the vision (an N trait) and scientifically-\nminded approach (T trait) of the NT personality (of course, the other types\nand temperaments have their own positive contributions as well).  However,\nwhen the NT person has self-image challenges, the \"dark-side\" of this\npersonality type usually comes out, which should be obvious to all.\n\nA physician who is a strong NT and who has not learned to temper their\ntemperament will be extremely business-like (lack of empathy or feeling),\nand is very compelled to have total control over their patient (the patient\nmust be obedient to their diagnosis and prescription without question).  I've\nknown many M.D.'s of this temperament and suffice to say I don't oblige them\nwith a followup visit, no matter how competent I think they are (and they\nusually are very competent from a knowledge viewpoint since that is an\nextreme drive of theirs - to know the most, to know it all).\n\nMaybe we need more NF doctor's.  :^)\n\nEnough on this subject - let's move on to candida bloom.\n\n\n\nYou've helped me already by your post.  Of course, I believe that I have\nbeen misdiagnosed on the net as suffering from 'anal retentivitis', but being\nthe phlegmatic I am, maybe I was just a little too harsh on a few people\nmyself in past posts.  Let's all try to raise the level of this discussion\nabove the level of anal effluent.\n\n\n\nIn my well-described situation (in prior posts), I definitely was immune\nstressed.  Blood tests showed my vitamin A levels were very low.  My sinuses\nwere a mess - no doubt the mucosal lining and the cilia were heavily damaged.\nI also was on antibiotics 15 times in 4 years!  In the end, even two weeks\nof Ceftin did not work and I had confirmed diagnoses of a chronic bacterial\ninfection of the sinuses via cat-scans, mucus color (won't get into the\ndetails), and other symptoms.  Three very traditional ENT's made this\ndiagnosis (I did not have any cultures done, however, because of the\ndifficulty of doing this right and because my other symptoms clearly showed\na bacterial infection).  Enough of this background (provided to help you\nunderstand where I was when I make comments about my Sporanox anti-fungal\ntherapy below).\n\n\nThe first question I have is this.  Can fungus penetrate a little way into poor\nmucus membrane tissue, maybe via hyphae, thus causing symptoms, without being\nconsidered 'systemic' in the classic sense?  It is sort of an inbetween\ninfection.\n\n\n\nI was concerned, too, because of the toxicity of vitamin A.  My doctor, after\nmy blood tests, put me on 75,000 IU of vitamin A for one week only, then\ndropped it down to 25,000 IU for the next couple of weeks.  I also received\nzinc and other supplementation, since all of these interrelate in fairly\ncomplex ways as my doctor explained (he's one of those 'evil' orthomolecular\nspecialists).  I had a blood test three weeks later and vitamin A was normal,\nhe then stopped me on all vitamin A (except for some in a multi-vitamin)\nsupplement), and made sure that I maintain a 50,000 IU/day of beta carotene.\nCall me carrot face.  :^)\n\nHopefully, Elaine's doctor will take a similar, careful approach and to\nall supplements.  I'm even reevaluating some supplements I'm taking, for\nexample, niacin in fairly large dosages, 1 gram/day, which Steve Dyer had\ngood information about on sci.med.nutrition.  If niacin only has second-order\nimprovement in symptomatic relief of my sinus allergies, then it probably is\nnot worth taking such a large dose long-term and risking liver damage.\n\n\n\nThough I do now believe, based on my successful therapy with Sporanox, that\nI definitely had some excessive growth of fungus (unknown species) in my\nsinuses, I still want to ask the question:  have there been any studies that\ndemonstrate candida \"blooms\" in the sinuses with associated sinus irritation\n(sinusitis/rhinitis)?  (My sinus irritation reduced significantly after one\nweek of Sporanox and no other new treatments were implemented during this\ntime - I did not have any noticeable GI track problems before starting on\nSporanox, but some for a few days after which then went away - considered\nnormal).\n\nBTW, my doctor dug out one of his medical reference books (sorry, can't\nremember which one), and found an obscure comment dating back into the 1950's\nwhich stated that people can develop contained (non-lethal or non-serious)\naspergillis infestations (aspergiliosis) of the sinuses leading to sinus\ninflammation symptoms.  I'll have to dig out that reference again since it\nis relevant to this discussion.\n\n\n\nMy doctor tested me (I believe a RAST or RAST similar test) for allergic\nresponse to specificially Candida albicans, and I showed a strong positive.\nAnother question, would everybody show the same strong positive so this test\nis essentially useless?  And, assuming it is true that Candida can grow\npart-way into the mucus membrane tissue, and the concentration exceeds a \nthreshold amount, could not a person who tests as having an allergy to\nCandida definitely develop allergic symptoms, such as mucus membrane\nirritation due to the body's allergic response?  As I said in an earlier post,\none does not need to be a rocket scientist, or have a M.D. degree or a \nPh.D. in biochemistry to see the plausibility of this hypothesis.\n\nBTW, and I'll repost this again.  Dr. Ivker, in his book, \"Sinus Survival\",\nhas routinely given, before anything else, Nizoral (a pre-Sporanox systemic\nanti-fungal, not as safe and not as good as Sporanox) to his new chronic\nsinusitis patients IF they have been on antibiotics four or more times in\nthe last two years.  He claims that out of 2000 or so patients, well over\n90% notice some relief of sinus inflammation and other symptoms, but it\ndoesn't cure it by any means, implying the so-called yeast/fungus infection\nis not the primary cause, but a later complication.  He's also found that\nnystatin, whether taken internally, or put into a sinus spray, does not help.\n\nThis implies (of course assuming that excessive yeast/fungus bloom is\naggravating the sinus inflammation) that the yeast/fungus has grown partway\ninto the tissue since nystatin will not kill yeast/fungus other than by\ndirect contact - it is not absorbed into the blood stream.  Again, I admit,\nlots of 'ifs', and 'implies', which doesn't please the hard-core NT who\nhas to have the double-blind study or it's a non-issue, but one has to start\nwith some plausible hypothesis/explanation, a strawman, if you will.\n\n\n\nThis brings up an interesting observation used by those who will deny\nand reject any and all aspects of the 'yeast hypothesis' until the\nappropriate studies are done.  And that is if you can't observe or culture\nthe yeast \"bloom\" in the gut or sinus, then there's no way to diagnose or\neven recognize the disease.  And I know they realize that it is virtually\nimpossible to test for candida overbloom in any part of the body that cannot\nbe easily observed since candida is everywhere in the body.\n\nIt's a real Catch-22.\n\nAnother Catch-22:  Those who totally reject the 'yeast hypothesis' say that\nno studies have been done (actually studies have been done, but if it's not\nup to a certain standard then it is, from their perspective, a non-study which\nshould not even be considered).  I agree that the appropriate studies should\nbe done, and that will take big $ to do it right.  However, in order to\nconvince the funding agencies in these austere times to open their wallets,\nyou literally have to give them evidence, and the only acceptable evidence to\ncompete with other proposals is paradoxically to do almost the exact study\nneeded funding.  That is, you have to do 90% of the study before you even get\nfunding (as a scientist at a National Lab, I'm very aware of this for the\nsmaller funded projects).  I'm afraid that even if Dr. Ivker and 100 other\ndoctors got together, pooled their practice's case histories and anecdotes\ninto a compelling picture, and approach the funding agencies, they would get\nnowhere, even if they were able to publish their statistical results.\n\nIt is obvious from the comments by some of the doctors here is that they have\n*decided* excessive yeast colonization in the gut or sinuses leading to\nnoticeable non-lethal symptoms does not exist, and is not even a tenable\nhypothesis, so any amount of case histories or compiled anecdotal evidence\nto the contrary will never change their mind, and not only that, they would\nalso oppose the needed studies because in their minds it's a done issue - \nexcessive yeast growth leading to diffuse allergic symptoms does not, will\nnot, and cannot exist.  Period.  Kind of tough to dialog with those who hold\nsuch a viewpoint.  Kind of reminds me of Lister...\n\n\n\nAren't there also other nutrients necessary to the proper working of the\nsinus mucus membranes and cilia?\n\n\n\nAgain, the evidence from mycological studies indicate that many yeast/fungus\nspecies can grow hyphae (\"roots\") into deep tissue, similar to mold growing\nin bread.  You can continue to kill the surface, such as nystatin does, but\nyou can't kill that which is deeper in the tissue without using a systemic\nanti-fungal such as itraconazole (Sporanox) or some of the older ones such\nas Nizoral which are more toxic and not as effective.  This is why, as has\nbeen pointed out by recent studies (sent to me by a doctor I've been in\ne-mail contact with - thanks), that nystatin is not effective in the long-\nterm treatment of GI tract \"candidiasis\".  It's like trying to weed a garden\nby cutting off what's above the ground but leaving the roots ready to come\nout again once you walk away.\n\nThe $60000 question is whether a contained candida \"bloom\" can partially\ngrow into tissue through the mucus membranes, causing some types of symptoms\nin susceptible people (e.g., allergy), without becoming \"systemic\" in the\nclassical sense of the word - something in between strictly an excessive\nbloom not causing any problems and the full-blown systemic infection that\nis potentially lethal.\n\n\n\nAlso, if one is an 'anal retentive', like I've been diagnosed in a prior\npost, that can also provide more sites for excessive candida growth.  ;^)\n\n\n\nAs I've said in private e-mail, there are flaws in our current medical system\nthat make it difficult or even impossible for a physician to attempt\nalternative therapies AFTER the approved/proven/accepted therapies don't work.\nFor example, I went to three ENT's, who all said that I will just have to live\nwith my acute/chronic sinusitis after the ab's failed (they did mention\nsurgery to open up the ostia, but my ostia weren't plugged and it would not\nget to the root cause of my condition).  After three months of aggressive and\nfairly non-standard therapy (Sporanox, body nutrient level monitoring and\nequalization, vitamin C, lentinen, echinacea, etc.), my health has vastly\nimproved to where I was two years ago, before my health greatly deteriorated.\nOf course, skeptics would say that maybe if I did nothing I would have\nimproved anyway, but that view is stretching things quite far because of the\nexperience of the three ENT's I saw who said that I'd just have to \"live with\nit\".  I'm confident I will reach what one could call a total \"cure\".  The\nanti-fungal program I undertook was one necessary step in that direction\nbecause of my overuse of ab's for the last four years.  (Note:  for those\nhaving sinus problems, may I suggest the book by Dr. Ivker I mention above.\nBe sure to get the revised edition.)\n\n\n\nDr. Ivker started off having chronic and severe sinus problems, and his\nvisits to several ENT's totally floored him when they said \"you'll just have\nto live with it\".  He spent several years trying everything - standard and\nnon-standard, until he was essentially cured of chronic sinusitis.  He now\nshares his approach in his book and I can honestly say that I am on the road\nto recovery following some parts of it.  His one recommendation to take a\nsystemic anti-fungal at the beginning of treatment IF you have a history of\nanti-biotic overuse has been proven to him time and time again in his own\npractice.  I'm sure if I commented to him of the hard-core beliefs of the anti-\n\"yeast hypothesis\" posters that he would have definite things to say, such as,\n\"it's worked wonders for me in almost two thousand cases\", to put it mildly.\nI also would not be surprised if he would say that they are the ones violating\ntheir moral obligations to help the patient.\n\nMaybe those doctors who are reading this who have a practice and are\nconfronted by a patient having symptoms that could be due to the \"hypothetical\nyeast overgrowth\" (e.g., they fit some of the profiles the pro-yeast people\nhave identified), should consider anti-fungal therapy IF all other avenues\nhave been exhausted.  Remember, theory and practice are two different things -\nyou cannot have one without the other, they are synergistic.  If a doctor does\nsomething non-standard yet produces noticeable symptomatic relief in over a\nthousand of his patients, shouldn't you at least sit up and take notice?\nMaybe you ought to trust what he says and begin hypothesizing why it works\ninstead of why it shouldn't work.  I'm afraid a lot of doctors have become\nso enamored with \"scientific correctness\" that they are ignoring the patients\nthey have sworn to help.  You have to do both;  both have to be balanced, which\nwe don't see from some of the posters to this group.  There comes a point when\nyou just have to use a little common sense, and maybe an empirical approach\n(such as trying a good systemic anti-fungal such as Sporanox) after having\nexhausted all the other avenues.  I was one of those who the traditional\nmedical establishment was not able to help, so I did the natural thing:  I\nwent to a couple of doctor's who are (somewhat) outside this establishment,\nand as a result I have found significant relief.\n\nWould it not be better if the traditional medical establishment can set up\nsome kind of mechanism where any doctor, without fear of being sued or having\nhis license pulled, can try experimental and unproven (beyond a doubt)\ntherapies for his/her patients that finally reach the point where all the\naccepted therapies are ineffective?  I'd like to hear a doctor tell me:\n\"well, I've tried all the therapies that are approved and accepted in this\ncountry, and since they clearly don't work for you, I now have the authority\nto use experimental, unproven techniques that seem to have helped others.  I\ncan't promise anything, and there are some risks.  You will have to sign\nsomething saying you understand the experimental and possibly risky nature of\nthese unproven therapies, and I'll have to register your case at the State\nBoard.\"  Anyway, if my ENT had suggested this to me, I would've jumped on this\npronto instead of going to one of those doctors who, for either altruistic\nreasons, or for greed, is practicing these alternative therapies with much\nrisk to him/her (risk meaning losing their license) and possibly to the\npatient.  Such a mechanism would keep control in the more mainstream medicine,\nand also provide valuable data that would essentially be free.  It also would\nbe morally and ethically better than the current system by showing the\ncompassion of the medical community to the patient - that it's doing everything\nit can within reason to help the patient.  It is the lack of such a mechanism\nthat is leading large numbers of people to try alternative therapies, some of\nwhich seem to work (like my case), and others of which will never work at all\n(true quackery).\n\nI better get off my soapbox before this post reaches 500K in size.\n\n\n\nWhat dosage of B6 appears to be necessary to promote the healing and proper\nworking of the mucos memebranes?\n\n\n\nI'd like to see the role of complex carbohydrates, such as starch.\n\n\n\nBrave soul you are.  The venom on Usenet can be quite toxic unless one\ndevelops an immunity to it.  One year ago, my phlegmatic self would have\nbacked down right away from an attack of cholericitis.  But my immune\nsystem, and my computer system, have been hardened from gradual\ndesensitization.  I now kind of like being called \"anal retentive\" - it has\na nice ring to it.  I also was very impressed by how it just flowed into the\npost - truly classic, worthy of a blue (or maybe brown) ribbon.  I might\neven cross-post it to alt.best.of.internet.  Hmmm...\n\n\n\nThanks again for a great and informative post.

{"text":"Classify the following data: \nI wish I could agree with you.  Ask yourself this.  Why would any private\nsector entity wish to buy a crypto system that was KNOWN to be at least\npartially compromised? (Key escrows in this instance)  Why would any\nprivate sector entity wish to buy a crypto system that had not been properly\nevaluated?  (i.e. algorythm not publically released)\nThe answer seems obvious to me, they wouldn't.  There is other hardware out\nthere not compromised.  DES as an example (triple DES as a better one.)\n\nMy suspicion is that the prices will drop dramatically on these non clipper\nsystems.  If not we're in trouble.\n\nGiven that the Clinton administration is not entirely stupid (although we'd like\nto think so) I cannot believe that they have failed to realize this.\nThey know their initiative will fail, much as crippled DES was never taken\nseriously.  The only way their moves can work is by coercion.  You know\nlittle about politics if you don't realize that this is just a first step\nin the next move, it makes NO sense otherwise.  The next move, banning\nor SEVERLY crippling crypto not using the \"Clipper\" system is easily\njustified \"Why would anyone want other encryption unless they were trying\nto subvert the government?  We've provided you with a very secure alternative\nso use it or go to jail/be fined/whatever.\"\nHow can you reconcile the administrations self proclaimed purpose of providing\nlaw enforcement with access to encrypted data without making the clipper system\nthe only crypto available in the U.S... ?  You simply can't, and the administration\nknows it.  Anyone who wanted to keep the govt. out of their hair, be it for\ndrug dealing or whatever, would just buy still available non-clipper systems.\n\nDon't sell our crafty Clinton types short, they can't be THAT stupid.\nEither banning non clipper crypto is the next answer or the administrations\ncollective I.Q. is about that of a potato.\n\nWhy do you think AT&T jumped on so fast?  They know it's going to be big,\nand NOT because it's better.  Right on the face of it, noone will buy the\nstuff that doesn't have to.  AT&T must know this too, THINK MAN, why the\nhell would they jump the gun?\n\n\nI really wonder.\n\nTo wit:  The letter I just sent to Clinton:\n\nThe White House\nOffice of the Press Secretary c/o:\nPresidential Comment Line (fax)\n(202) 456-2461\n \nApril 17, 1993\n \nSir and/or Madam:\n \n \nI must object most strongly to the administrations evolving position on encryption and\ncryptography.  I am shocked at the Clinton regimes increasing lean towards a authoritarian approach with regard to privacy and freedom from government oversight in day to day life.\n \nIt is apparent to me that those who drafted the \"Clipper Chip Proposal\" (which is, incidentally, gaining notoriety as the \"Big Brother Proposal\") are either incredibly ignorant or very sly indeed.  Anyone knowledgeable in the nuances of cryptographic development and research must understand that a key step in the development of a new algorithm, especially one destined for standardization, is the full disclosure of the algorithm to the private and academic sectors.  The proper evaluation of an algorithm dep\n\n\n\n\n\nends on careful scrutiny by these sectors, and only such scrutiny can provide true public confidence in the security of the algorithm.  The assumption that a new algorithm will be accepted based on assurances from \"experts\" without full disclosure is plain ignorance.\n \nIn addition, the assumption that an algorithm will be marketable over other technology, such as DES, when it is characterized by key escrow is lunacy.  It seems an easy step in the logic chain that probable consumers will prefer to purchase equipment not crippled by government key escrow, no matter how \"tamper proof\" the key escrows might be.\n \nI cannot believe that even the least educated policy maker would have failed to realize these flaws.  I can only assume then that the drafters of the \"Clipper Chip Proposal\" knew very well the difficulties of selling a crippled system to the private sector.  The only way this proposal makes any sense, or has any chance of succeeding is in coercion.  Even the language of the proposal makes it painfully clear that the next logical step is the outlawing of other encryption devices and hardware that do not uti\n\n\n\n\n\nlize the \"Big Brother Chip.\"\n \nUnfortunately the public at large is not educated enough on the issue to realize what they are losing.  I expect the Big Brother proposal to encounter little resistance from the American people who you will have so efficiently duped once again with pretty words like \"harmony,\" \"right to encryption,\" and \"voluntary.\"\n \nIt mortifies me that the phrase that seems to be used more and more often to characterize the Clinton administration is \"I can't believe it's happening here.\"  More startling is a question a colleague of mine posed and the realization that everyday it becomes more and more relevant; \"When is the Reichstag fire planned for?\"\n \n \n\t\t\t\t\t\tMost Concerned,\n \n\t\t\t\t\t\t[Signature]\n\t\t\t\t\t\tShaen Logan Bernhardt I\nuni@acs.bu.edu\n","label":"sci.crypt"}

{"text":"Classify the following data: I would like the opinion of netters on a subject that has been bothering my\nwife and me lately: liturgy, in particular, Catholic liturgy.  In the last few\nyears it seems that there are more and more ad hoc events during Mass.  It's\ndriving me crazy!  The most grace-filled aspect of a liturgical tradition is\nthat what happens is something we _all_ do together, because we all know how to \ndo it.  Led by the priest, of course, which makes it a kind of dialogue we \npresent to God.  But the best Masses I've been to were participatory prayers.\n\nLately, I think the proportion of participation has fallen, and the proportion\nof sitting there and watching, or listening, or generally being told what to do\n(which is necessary because no one knows what's happening next) is growing.\nExample.  Last Sunday (Palm Sunday) we went to the local church.  Usually\non Palm Sunday, the congregation participates in reading the Passion, taking\nthe role of the mob.  The theology behind this seems profound--when we say\n\"Crucify him\" we mean it.  We did it, and if He came back today we'd do it\nagain.  It always gives me chills.  But last week we were \"invited\" to sit\nduring the Gospel (=Passion) and _listen_.  Besides the Orwellian \"invitation\", \nI was really saddened to have my (and our) little role taken away.  This seems\ntypical of a shift of participation away from the people, and toward the\nmusicians, readers, and so on.  New things are introduced in the course of the\nliturgy and since no one knows what's happening, the new things have to be\nexplained, and pretty soon instead of _doing_ a lot of the Mass we're just\nsitting there listening (or spacing out, in my case) to how the Mass is about\nto be done.  In my mind, I lay the blame on liturgy committees made up of lay\n\"experts\", but that may not be just.  I do think that a liturgy committee has a\nbias toward doing something rather than nothing--that's just a fact of\nbureaucratic life--even though a simpler liturgy may in fact make it easier for\npeople to be aware of the Lord's presence.\n\nSo we've been wondering--are we the oddballs, or is the quality of the Mass\ngoing down?  I don't mean that facetiously.  We go to Mass every Thursday or\nFriday and are reminded of the power of a very simple liturgy to make us aware \nof God's presence.  But as far as the obligatory Sunday Masses...maybe I should \njust offer it up :)  Has anyone else noticed declining congregational\nparticipation in Catholic Masses lately?","label":"soc.religion.christian"}

Without\nall the details, people who want to help you often have to guess -- if they are\nable to respond at all.\n\n\tAlways mention what version of X you are using and where you got it \nfrom. If your server came from a different source as the rest of your X system,\ngive details of that, too.  Give the machine type, operating system, and O/S \nversion for both the client and server machine.  It may also be appropriate to \nmention the window manager, compiler, and display hardware type you are using.\n\n\tThen tell exactly what you are doing, exactly what happens, and what\nyou expected/wanted to happen.  If it is a command that fails, include the \nexact transcript of your session in the message.  If a program you wrote \ndoesn't work the way you expect, include as little of the source necessary \n(just a small test case, please!) for readers to reproduce the problem.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject:   8)  What publications discussing X are available?\n\n\tThe trade magazines (Unix World, Unix Review, Computer Language, etc.)\nare publishing more articles on X.  Two X-specific publications include:\n\n\t- O'Reilly and Associates publishes \"The X Resource: A Practical \nJournal of the X Window System\" (103 Morris St. #A, Sebastapol, CA 95472).  \nEditorial information: Adrian Nye, adrian@ora.com.\n\n\t- The X Journal is started bi-monthly publication September 1991 on a \nvariety of X topics. Subscription information: The X Journal, Subscriber \nServices, Dept XXX, P.O. Box 3000, Denville, NJ 07834, USA. Editorial \ninformation: editors%topgun@uunet.uu.net.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject:   9)  What are these common abbreviations/acronyms?\n\n\tXt: The X Toolkit Intrinsics is a library layered on Xlib which \nprovides the functionality from which the widget sets are built. An \"Xt-based\" \nprogram is an application which uses one of those widget sets and which uses \nIntrinsics mechanisms to manipulate the widgets.\n\tXmu: The Xmu library is a collection of Miscellaneous Utility functions\nuseful in building various applications and widgets.\n\tXaw: The Athena Widget Set is the MIT-implemented sample widget set\ndistributed with X11 source.\n\tXm: The OSF/Motif widget set from the Open Software Foundation; binary\nkits are available from many hardware vendors.\n\tXhp (Xw): The Hewlett-Packard Widget Set was originally based on R2++, \nbut several sets of patches exist which bring it up to R3, as it is distributed\non the X11R4 tapes. Supplemental patches are available to use it with R4/R5.\n\tCLX: The Common Lisp X Interface is a Common Lisp equivalent to Xlib.\n\tXDMCP: The X Display Manager Protocol provides a uniform mechanism for \na display such as an X terminal to request login service from a remote host.\n\tXLFD: The X Logical Font Description Conventions describes a standard\nlogical font description and conventions to be used by clients so that they\ncan query and access those resources.\n\tRTFM: Common expert-speak meaning \"please locate and consult the \nrelevant documentation -- Read the Forgotten Manual\".\n\tUTSL: A common expression meaning \"take advantage of the fact that you \naren't limited by a binary license -- Use The Source, Luke\".\n\tAPI: Application-Programmer Interface. The function calls, etc., in\na programming library.\n\tBDF: Bitmap Distribution Format; a human-readable format for uncompiled\nX fonts.\n\tGUI: graphical user interface.\n\tUIL: the User Interface Language, part of OSF/Motif which lets \nprogrammers specify a widget hierarchy in a simple \"outline\" form\n\tWCL: the Widget Creation Language, a package which extends the \nunderstanding of the Xt resource format such that a widget hierarchy and \nactions on the widgets can be specified through the resources file\n\tGIL: the file format put out by Sun's OpenWindows Developers Guide 3.0\n\tUIMS: User Interface Management System\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject:  10)  What is the ICCCM? (How do I write X-friendly applications?)\n\n\tThe Inter-Client Communication Conventions Manual is one of the \nofficial X Consortium standards documents that define the X environment. It \ndescribes the conventions that clients must observe to coexist peacefully with \nother clients sharing the same server.  If you are writing X clients, you need \nto read and understand the ICCCM,  in particular the sections discussing the \nselection mechanism and the interaction between your client and the window \nmanager.  Get it either:\n\t- as part of the R4 distribution from MIT\n\t- in the later editions of the Scheifler/Gettys \"X Window System\" book\n\t- as an appendix in the new version of O'Reilly's Volume 0, \"X Protocol\nReference Manual.\" A version in old copies of their Volume 1 is obsolete.\n\tThe version in the Digital Press book is much more readable, thanks to \nthe efforts of Digital Press's editors to improve the English and the \npresentation.\n\n[from David Rosenthal, 10/90]\n\n\t- the ICCCM was updated for R5; updates are published in O'Reilly's\n\"Programmer's Supplement for Release 5\". The complete document is on the R5\ntapes.\n\n\tAlternate definition: the ICCCM is generally the M in \"RTFM\" and is\nthe most-important of the least-read X documents.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject:  11)  What is the X Consortium, and how do I join?\n\n\tThe MIT X Consortium was formed in January of 1988 to further the\ndevelopment of the X Window System and has as its major goal the promotion of \ncooperation within the computer industry in the creation of standard software \ninterfaces at all layers in the X Window System environment.\n\tMIT's role is to provide the vendor-neutral architectural and \nadministrative leadership required to make this work. Membership in the \nConsortium open to any organization.  There are two categories of membership, \nMember (for large organizations) and Affiliate (for smaller organizations).\n\tMost of the Consortium's activities take place via electronic mail, \nwith meetings when required.  As designs and specifications take shape,\ninterest groups are formed from experts in the participating organizations.  \nTypically a small multi-organization architecture team leads the design, with \nothers acting as close observers and reviewers.  Once a complete specification\nis produced, it may be submitted for formal technical review by the Consortium\nas a proposed standard.  The standards process typically includes public \nreview (outside the Consortium) and a demonstration of proof of concept.\n\tYour involvement in the public review process or as a Member or \nAffiliate of the Consortium is welcomed.\n\tWrite to: Bob Scheifler, MIT X Consortium, Laboratory for Computer \nScience, 545 Technology Square, Cambridge, MA 02139.\n\n[For complete information see the XCONSORTIUM man page from the X11R4\ndistribution, from which this information is adapted.] [2/90]\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject:  12)  Just what are OPEN LOOK and Motif?\n\n\tOPEN LOOK and Motif are two graphical user interfaces (GUIs). OPEN LOOK\nwas developed by Sun with help from AT&T and many industry reviewers; Motif was\ndeveloped by the Open Software Foundation (OSF) with input from many OSF \nmembers. \n\n\tOPEN LOOK is primarily a user-interface specification and style-guide; \nthere are several toolkits which can be used to produce OPEN LOOK applications.\nMotif includes an API specification; the only sanctioned Motif toolkit is the \none from OSF. However, there are other toolkits which can be used to produce \nprograms which look and behave like OSF/Motif; one of these, ParcPlace's \n(formerly Solbourne's) OI, is a \"virtual toolkit\" which provides objects in the\nstyle of OPEN LOOK and Motif, at the user's choice.\n\n\tOPEN LOOK GUI is also the name of a product from AT&T, comprising \ntheir OPEN LOOK Intrinsics Toolkit and a variety of applications.\n\n[Thanks to Ian Darwin, ian@sq.com, 5/91]\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject:  13)  Just what is OpenWindows?\n\n\tOpen Windows (3.0) is a Sun product that encompasses: a window system \nthat combines a NeWS and X11-compliant server (X/NeWS); a user-interface \nspecification (OPEN LOOK) and a series of toolkits that implement it (including\nthe SunView-like XView and the Xt-based OLIT); Xlib and Xt implementations; and\na number of utilities (olwm window manager, filemgr, shelltool, etc.).\n\n[thanks to Frank Greco (fgreco@govt.shearson.COM), 8/90; 4/92] \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject:  14)  Just what is DECWindows?\n\n\tDECWindows is a DEC product that encompasses: an X11 server; the XUI \ntoolkit, including the Dwt widget set and UIL; Xlib and Xt implementations; a \nsession manager; and a number of utilities (dxwm window manager, dxcalendar, \ndxpsview, etc.).\n\n(At some point Motif flavors of the toolkit and applications will be shipped.)\n[8/90] \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject:  15)  What is PEX?\n\n\tPEX is the \"PHiGS Extension to X\".\n\tPHiGS stands for \"Programmer's Hierarchical Interactive Graphics \nSystem\" and is essentially a library of functions that simplifies the creation \nand manipulation of 3D graphics. Many platforms are capable of performing in \nhardware the computations involved in rendering 3D objects; the extension \nallows the client (PHiGS in this case) to take advantage of the specialized \nhardware for 3D graphics.\n\tSun Microsystems is currently contracted to develop a freely \nredistributable (copyright similar to the current X copyright) sample\nimplementation.  Source and documentation are available in the R5 release.\nSeveral vendors are currently selling independently-developed PEX servers for \ntheir workstations and X terminals.\n\n[last modified 10/91]\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject:  16)  What is \"low-bandwidth X\" (LBX)? XRemote? PPP? SLIP? CSLIP?\n\nThere are several options for using X over serial lines:\n\nSLIP - Serial Line IP; this is both a mechanism and a protocol for sending IP\npackets over point-to-point serial links. It has been around for several years,\nand implementations are available for many of the major TCP/IP implementations.\nMost X Terminal vendors supply this as a checkoff item, although nobody really \never uses it since it is horribly slow.  The TCP/IP headers add 40 bytes per \npacket and the TCP/IP encoding of the X protocol is rather verbose (rightfully \nso; it is optimized for packing and unpacking over high-speed links). \n\nCSLIP - Compressed header SLIP; this is a variant of SLIP that compresses the \n40 bytes of TCP/IP headers down to about 5 or 6 bytes.  It still doesn't do \nanything about reencoding the X protocol.  Modems that do compression can help,\nbut they increase packet latency (it takes time to dribble the uncompressed \ndata through typical serial interfaces, plus the compression assembly time).\n\nPPP - Point-to-Point Protocol; this is an emerging standard for point-to-point\nlinks over serial lines that has a more complete set of option negotiation than\nSLIP.  A growing number of people see the combination of PPP for the serial \nline management and CSLIP for the header compression as becoming common for \nrunning normal TCP/IP protocols over serial lines.  Running raw X over the wire\nstill needs compression somewhere to make it usable.\n\nXRemote - this is the name of both a protocol and set of products originally\ndeveloped by NCD for squeezing the X protocol over serial lines.  In addition \nto using a low level transport mechanism similar to PPP/CSLIP, XRemote removes \nredundancies in the X protocol by sending deltas against previous packets and \nusing LZW to compress the entire data stream.  This work is done by either a \npseudo-X server or \"proxy\" running on the host or in a terminal server.  There \nare several advantages to doing compression outside the modem:\n   (1)\tYou don't *have* to have compressing modems in there if you wouldn't \n\totherwise be using them (e.g. if you were going to be directly \n\tconnected), and\n   (2)\tIt reduces the I/O overhead by cutting down on the number of bytes that\n\thave to cross the serial interface, and\n   (3)\tIn addition to the effects of #2, it reduces the latency in delivering \n\tpackets by not requiring the modem to buffer up the data waiting for \n\tblocks to compress.\n\nLBX - Low Bandwidth X; this is an X Consortium project that is working on a\nstandard for this area.  It is being chaired by NCD and Xerox and is using \nNCD's XRemote protocol as a stepping stone in developing the new protocol.  LBX\nwill go beyond XRemote by adding proxy caching of commonly-used information \n(e.g. connection setup data, large window properties, font metrics, keymaps, \netc.) and a more efficient encoding of the X protocol. The hope is to have a \nStandard ready for public review in the first half of next year and a sample \nimplementation available in R6.\n\nAdditional technical information about how XRemote works and a few notes on how\nLBX might be different are available via anonymous ftp from export.lcs.mit.edu\nin contrib/ in the following files:\n        XRemote-slides.ps               slides describing XRemote\n        XRemote-LBX-diffs.ps            more slides describing some of LBX\n\n[information provided by Jim Fulton, jim@ncd.com; 7/92]\n\n\tThere is also a set of slides on export from Jim Fulton's talk at\nthe 7th MIT X Technical Conference.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject:  17)  TOPIC: USING X IN DAY-TO-DAY LIFE\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject:  18)! What are all these different window managers?\n\n\tThe window manager in X is just another client -- it is not part of the\nX window system, although it enjoys special privileges -- and so there is\nno single window manager; instead, there are many which support different ways \nfor the user to interact with windows and different styles of window layout,\ndecoration, and keyboard and colormap focus. In approximate chronological order\n(generally, the more recent ones are more conformant with the ICCCM):\n\n\twm: this simple title-bar window manager was phased out in R2 or R3\n\tuwm: the Universal Window Manager is still popular for its speed, \nalthough it is very outdated. Moved to contrib/ on the R4 tape.\n\ttwm (old): Tom's Window Manager was among the first non-MIT window \nmanagers and offered the user a great deal of customization options in a\nre-parenting window manager. \n\tawm: the Ardent Window Manager remains a hotbed for hackers and offers\nsome features (dynamic menus) not found on more current window managers\n\tcwm: cwm is part of the Andrew system. \n\trtl: Siemen's window manager tiles windows so that they don't overlap\nand resizes the window with the focus to its preferred size.\n\tdxwm: Digital's dxwm is part of the DECwindows offering\n\thpwm: HP's window manager offers a 3D look; it is a precursor of mwm\n\tmwm: the Motif window manager is part of the OSF/Motif toolkit\n\ttekwm: Tektronix's window manager offering \n\tolwm (Sun): olwm implements the OPEN LOOK GUI and some of the Style\nGuide functionality\n\tolwm (AT&T): ditto\n\tgwm: Bull's Generic Window Manager emulates others with a built-in\nLisp interpreter. Version 1.7h (10/91) is on the R5 contrib tape; 1.7n is on\navahi.inria.fr and export.lcs.mit.edu. [3/93]\n\tm_swm: the Sigma window manager is on the R4 tape\n\tpswm: Sun's PostScript-based pswm is part of the OpenWindows release\n\tswm: Solbourne's swm is based on the OI toolkit and offers multiple\nGUI support and also a panned virtual window; configuration information comes\nfrom the resources file\n\ttwm (new): MIT's new Tab Window Manager from the R4 tape is a reworked\ntwm and is the basis for several derivatives, including the one on the R5 tape\n\tvtwm: vtwm offers some of the virtual-desktop features of swm, with a\nsingle-root window implementation; it is based on the R4 twm and is available\non archive servers. A new version, vtwm-5.0, is based on R5.9 and is available \nfrom export. [3/92]\n\ttvtwm: Tom's Virtual Tab Window Manager is also based on the R4 twm\nand provides a virtual desktop modeled on the virtual-root window of swm. It is\navailable on archive servers\n\tolvwm: the vtwm-style virtual-desktop added to Sun's olwm. It is \navailable on archive servers; version 3.3 [1/93] is on export.\n\tmvwm: the vtwm-style virtual-desktop added to OSF's mwm. A beta version\nis floating around (most recently from suresh@unipalm.co.uk) but requires a \nsource license to OSF/Motif 1.1.3 [3/92].\n\tNCDwm: the window manager local to NCD terminals offers an mwm look \n\tXDSwm: the window manager local to Visual Technology's terminals \n\tctwm: Claude Lecommandeur's (lecom@sic.epfl.ch) modification of the R5 \ntwm offers 32 virtual screens in the fashion of HP vuewm; source is on export.\nVersion 2.2.2 [2/93] also offers the window overview used in vtwm and tvtwm.\n\tvuewm: HP's MWM-based window manager offers configurable workspaces.\n\t4Dwm: SGI's enhanced MWM\n\tpiewm: this version of tvtwm offers pie menus\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject:  19)  Why does my X session exit when I kill my window manager (sic)?\n\n\tIt needn't.  What is probably happening is that you are running your \nwindow manager as the last job in your .xsession or .xinitrc file; your X \nsession runs only as long as the last job is running, and so killing your \nwindow manager is equivalent to logging out. Instead, run the window manager in\nthe background, and as the last job instead invoke something safe like:\n\t\texec xterm -name Login -rv -iconic\nor any special client of your devising which exits on some user action.\nYour X session will continue until you explicitly logout of this window, \nwhether or not you kill or restart your window manager.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject:  20)  Can I save the state of my X session, like toolplaces does?\n\n\tAlthough no known window manager directly supports such a feature --\nwhich may be equivalent to writing out a .xinitrc or .xsession file naming the\ngeometry and WM_COMMAND of each application (but olvwm may have something \nclose) -- there is a contributed application which does much of what you are \nlooking for, although it is not as complete as the SunView program toolplaces. \nLook for the application \"xplaces\" on an archive-server near you. There are \nseveral versions of this program floating around; look for a recent vintage.\n[10/90]\n\tSome new pseudo session-managers such as HP's vuewm provide for the \nsaving of sessions including information on the geometry of currently-running\napplications and the resource database. \n[Bjxrn Stabell (bjoerns@staff.cs.uit.no); 3/93.]\n \n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject:  21)  How do I use another window manager with DEC's session manager?\n\n\tDEC's session manager will start dxwm up by default. To override this, \nadd to your .Xdefaults file something like this line, naming the full pathname:\n\tsm.windowManagerName:   /wherever/usr/bin/X11/your_favorite_wm\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject:  22)  How do I change the keyboard auto-repeat rate?\n\n\tYou can turn auto-repeat on or off by using \"xset r on|off\". The X\nprotocol, however, doesn't provide for varying the auto-repeat rate, which is\na capability not supported by all systems.\n\tSome servers running on systems that support this, however, may provide\ncommand-line flags to set the rate at start-up time. If you have control over \nserver start-up (see the man pages for xinit and xdm), you can invoke the \nserver with the chosen settings; for example, you can start the Xsun server \nfrom MIT with the options \"-ar1 350 -ar2 30\" to reduce the sensitivity of the \nkeyboard.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject:  23)  How do I remap the keys on my keyboard to produce a string?\n\n\tThere is no method of arranging for a particular string to be\nproduced when you press a particular key. The xmodmap client, which is useful \nfor moving your CTRL and ESC keys to useful places, just rearranges keys and \ndoes not do \"macro expansion.\"\n\tSome (few) clients, including xterm and several X-based editors, \naccept a translation resource such as:\n\txterm*VT100.Translations: #override \\\n\t\t<Key>F1: string(\"setenv DISPLAY unix:0\")\nwhich permits the shorthand F1 to be pressed to reset the display locally\nwithin an xterm; it takes effect for new xterm clients. To include control\ncharacters in the string, use \\nnn, where nnn is the octal encoding of the\ncontrol character you want to include.\n\tWindow managers, which could provide this facility, do not yet; nor\nhas a special \"remapper\" client been made available.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDavid B.

But of\ncourse you don't consider this AT ALL when you find a juicy\n\"quotation\" that you can use to attack Israel.\n\nBenny Morris (of Hashomer Hatzair) represents himself as a \"scholar\"\nwhen he rehashes the old attacks on the Irgun.  Don't be fooled.\nIt's just the old Zionist ideological catfight, surfacing as an\nattack on the (then-) Likud government.  If you will look closely at\nthe section on Deir Yassin in his book on the War of Independence,\nyou will see his \"indictment\" to be pure hot air.  And this is the\nBEST HE CAN DO after decades of digging for any sort of damning\nevidence.  Unfortunately for him, because his book parades itself as\n\"scholarly,\" he is forced to put footnotes.  So you can clearly see\nthat his Deir Yassin account is based on nothing.\n\nThe Deir Yassin \"massacre\" never took place as the propagandists\ntell it, any more than the Sabra and Shatila \"massacres.\" Do you get\nthe feeling people like to blame the Jews for \"massacres,\" even if\nthey have to make them up?  It must sound spicy.  Even some Jews\nlike to do it, for reasons of their own.\n\nPlease, don't confuse any of you Deir Yassin \"massacre\" stuff\nwith facts or scholarship.  You should stick to Begin's version\nunless you find something serious to contradict it.","label":"talk.politics.mideast"}

{"text":"Classify the following data: \nOK, as one last attempt, I'll take a different tack.\n\nWe all seem to be in agreement that there are two explanations for why\none can use the handlebars to lean a moving motorcycle. The question is,\nis one of the effect dominant, and which one is it? The idea would be to\ndesign an experiment which would seaprate the two characteristics, and\nsee which effect produces a similar result to the one with which those of\nus who have bikes are familiar.\n\nLet's look at the one that, so far, has sparked no controversy on its\nown, gyroscopic precession. To examine this alone, we would have to\nget rid of the contact patch effect, by not allowing the contact patches\nto transmit any force. The wheels and steering mechanism would have to\nremain, and be attached to a vehicle with about the same weight as a bike,\nthrough suspension (so that the wheels transmit forces to the bike the\nsame way) similar to a bikes. An experiment would be to ride a bike along \na dry road to get moving and to get the wheels spinning, then change \nsurfaces to something that won't transmit forces through the contact \npatches, and try a steering manoeuvre to see if the bike leans. It \nprobably would, since some of us know how easy it is to fall down on ice, \nbut we wouldn't get a good idea of how well or what it feels like \nbecause, without the contact patches, we can't turn.  Maybe there's a \nbetter way. Besides, even ice doesn't get rid of the contact patch\nforces altogether, so we'd have to find a really frictionless surface.\nYou'd have to try it again with the wheels locked to really know if it\nwas the rotation that did it.\n\nLooking at the contact-patch effect only, however, is fairly simple.\nNow we have to find a vehicle that gets the about the same magnitude and\ndirection of cantact patch forces as a motorcycle, and transmits them\nabout the same way to the vehicle, but without rotating wheels.\nHow it gets the contact patch forces is irrelevant, we're just looking\nfor something that has contact patches that can go straight and not\nsideways, and skis or skates would do fine. I don't know of any snow-ski\nor skate bikes, but up here we have the Suzuki Wetbike that is arranged\nlike a motorcycle but has fat water skis where there should be wheels.\nI think the propellor is in front of the rear ski, or something like\nthat, but we could try it at a coast to get rid of most of its effect.\nNow I admit that this is second hand info (although I'd love to try\none of these), but the review in the local cycle rag and a guy in\na bike shop that sells them both say that this machine handles very\nmuch like a motorcycle, in that you countersteer it to turn.\nSo we have contact patches that transmit similar forces to a bike's,\na similar suspension arrangement, and no gyroscopes, but we do have\ncountersteering.\n\nConclusion: you don't need gyroscopes to countersteer vehicles that have\nmotorcycle-like contact patch arrangements. We still don't know what\nreal effect the gyroscopes have when they're there, but from my observations\nof how handlebar angle, force, etc. relate to steering in general, I'm \nwilling to bet that they're not the dominant factor in countersteering. \n\nIf you don't like this conclusion, then don't accept it, but my motorcycle's\nbehaviour is consistent with it. If someone can prove otherwise, go ahead.","label":"rec.motorcycles"}

Since the primary targets of help are\nMuslim victims of \"ethnic cleansing\", you imply that such Muslim victims are\nbutchers.\n\n\nThis implies both sides are equal.

Would you, in WWII have said that there were atrocities\non the sides of both the Jews and the Germans?\n\n\nYes, but both sides want different things.  The Muslims chiefly want to not\nbe \"ethnic cleansed\".  The Serbians want to \"ethnic cleanse\" the Muslims.  It\nis indeed true that each side will stop when it gets what it wants, but the\nthings that the two sides want are not equivalent.\n\n\nI recall, before we did anything for Somalia, (apparent) left-wingers saying\nthat the reason everyone was more willing to send troops to Bosnia than to\nSomalia was because the Somalis are third-worlders who Americans consider\nunworthy of help.

He assumed that\n##some of the problems may have been caused by poor translations in by-\n##gone days.  So, he read what he could find in Hebrew, Greek, Aramaic.\n##What he found was that the problems didn't go away, they got worse.\n##Then, he decided to see if other religions had the same problems.\n##So, he picked up the Holy Qur'an (in French) and found similar prob-\n##lems, but not as many.  SO, he applied the same logoic as he had\n##with the Bible: he learned to read it in Arabic.  The problems he\n##had found with the French version went away in Arabic.  He was unable\n##to find a wealth of scientific statements in the Holy Qur'an, but,\n##what he did find made sense with modern understanding.  So, he\n##investigated the Traditions (the hadith) to see what they had to\n##say about science.  they were filled with science problems; after\n##all, they were contemporary narratives from a time which had, by\n##pour standards, a primitive world view.  His conclusion was that,\n##while he was impressed that what little the Holy Qur'an had to\n##say about science was accurate, he was far more impressed that the\n##Holy Qur'an did not contain the same rampant errors evidenced in\n##the Traditions.  How would a man of 7th Century Arabia have known\n##what *not to include* in the Holy Qur'an (assuming he had authored\n##it)?  \n##\n\n    So in short the writer (or writers) of Quran decided to stay away from\nscience.  (if you do not open your mouth, then you don't put you foot into\nyour mouth either). \n\n   But then if you say Quran does not talk much about science, then one can\nnot make claims (like Bobby does) that you have great science in Quran.\n\n   Basically I want to say that *none* of the religious texts are supposed to\nbe scientific treatises.

If this were\nso, knife attacks in cities where guns were widely used in homicide\nwould be expected to show a low fatality rate, and knife attacks in\ncities where guns were not so widely used (like Vancouver) would show\na higher fatality rate.  But the Nat'l Commission on the Causes and\nPrevention of Violence Task Force analyzed the data and found this\nnot to be the case.  It appeared to them that as the number of knife\nattacks increased in relation to the number of firearms attacks\n(which presumably happened where guns were less available to assailants),\nthe proportion of FATAL knife attacks did NOT increase relative to the\nproportion of gun attacks.  In fact, the reverse was true.\n\nWhat was found was that most homicides did not show a determination on\nthe part of the assailant to kill.  Fatalities caused by knife tended\nto show a single-mindedness on the part of the assailant to do grave\nphysical injury: multiple stabs wounds, wounds concentrated about the\nhead neck and chest, etc.  Most gun homicides did not show this\npattern.  Rather, more fatal attacks were committed during a moment of\nrage and not the focused intent to kill the victim.\n\n\tSource: Report on Firearms and Violence\n\n: Then, since England != USA (my ancestors left because of the oppression) you  \n: must compare England before strict gun laws to England after strict gun laws to  \n: be able to draw any meaning at all.  England has essentially legalized drugs,  \n: so there are no drug gangs battling for turf, etc., there.  If you drop out the  \n: drug related killings here, the USA would look a whole lot more peaceful.\n\nThere are a lot of factors which make a difference.  Actually, I'm not\nfond of making ANY kind of social parallels between Europeans and\nAmericans. There are more cultural, beahvioral and economic\ndifferences between us than similarities.  I just sort of found\nmyself backed into that corner over the last couple of weeks.  I\ndon't think we could ever attain the low levels of European violent\ncrime here in the US, whether we banned guns or required every\nlaw-abiding citizen to carry a loaded Uzi.\n\nOn the other hand, we can draw lessons from neighbors who are more\nculturally similar, namely the Canadians.  In fact, an exhaustive,\nseven-year study has already been done of the respective crime rates\nof Vancouver, British Columbia and Seattle, Washington... cities\nwith roughly the same population, urban economy, geography\nand crime but with decidedly different approaches to gun control.\n\nIn Seattle, handguns may be purchased legally for self-defense.  After\na 30-day waiting period, a permit can be obtained to carry a concealed\nweapon.  The recreational use of handguns is minimally restricted.\n\nIn Vancouver, self-defense is not considered a valid or legal reason\nto purchase a handgun.  Concealed weapons are not permitted.\nRecreational uses of handguns (target shooting, collecting) are\nregulated by the province.  Purchase of a handgun requires a\nrestricted-weapons permit.  A permit to carry may be obtained in\norder to transport the weapon to licensed shooting clubs.  Handguns\ntransported by vehicle must be stored in the trunk in a locked box.\nIn short, gun control but not unreasonably so.\n\nBoth cities aggressively enforce their gun laws.  Convictions for\ngun-related offenses carry similar penalties.  The researchers\nstudied all cases of robbery, assault (simple and aggravated),\nburglary and homicides occurring in Seattle and Vancouver from\n1/1/80 to 12/31/86. In defining the cases, they used the same\nstandard: the FBI's Unified Crime Report.\n\nResults: during the seven-year study the annual rate of robbery in\nSeattle was found to be only slightly higher than that in Vancouver\n(1.09 / 1.11).  Burglaries occurred at nearly identical rates (.99).\n18,925 assaults were recorded in Seattle versus 12,034 in\nVancouver.  The risk of being a victim of a simple assault in\nSeattle was found to be only slightly higher than Vancouver (1.18 /\n1.15) and the risk of aggravated assault was also slightly higher\n(1.16 / 1.12).  However, when aggravated assaults were subdivided by\nweapon and the mechanism of assault, a clear pattern emerged.\nAlthough both cities reported nearly identical rates of aggravated\nassault involving knives and other dangerous weapons, firearms were\nfar more likely to be used in Seattle.  In fact, 7.7 times as often.\n\nOver the seven-year study, 388 homicides occurred in Seattle\n(11.3 per 100,000) vs. 204 homicides in Vancouver (6.9 per 100,000).\nAfter adjustment for differences in age and sex among the populations,\nthe relative risk of being a victim of homicide in Seattle, as\ncompared to Vancouver, was found to be 1.63.\n\nWhen homicides were subdivided by the mechanism of death, the rate\nof homicide by knives and other weapons (excluding firearms) in\nSeattle was found to be almost identical to that in Vancouver.\nVirtually ALL of the increased risk of death in Seattle was due to\na more than fivefold higher rate of homicide by firearms.  Handguns\naccounted for roughly 85% of homicides involving firearms.  Handguns\nwere 4.8 times more likely to be used in homicides in Seattle than\nin Vancouver.\n\nThe authors of the report also investigated \"legally justifiable\"\nhomicides (self-defense).  Only 32 such homicides occurred during\nthe seven-year study, 11 of which were committed by police.  Only\n21 cases of civilians acting in self-defense occurrred: 17 in\nSeattle and 4 in Vancouver.  Only 13 involved firearms.  After\nexcluding these cases, there was virtually no impact on these\nearlier findings.\n\n-------\n\nThis is, I feel, a very fair report.  One might even make the\nargument that it is biased against Canada as a whole because\nVancouver reports annual rates of homicide two to three times\nthat of Ottawa, Calgary and Toronto while Seattle reports\nannual homicide rates only half to two-thirds that of NYC,\nChicago, Los Angeles and Houston.\n\nCritics of handgun control always argue that limited legal access\nto handguns will have little effect on the rates of homicide because\npersons intent on killing others will only try harder to acquire a\ngun or will kill by other means.  This report shows differently.\nIf the rate of homicide in a community were influenced more by\nthe strength of intent than by the availability of weapons, we\ncould expect the rate of homicides by weapons other than guns to\nbe higher in Vancouver than in Seattle.  However, during the study\ninterval, Vancouver's rate of homicide by weapons other than guns\nwas not significantly higher than that in Seattle, suggesting that\nfew would-be assailants switched to homicide by other methods.\n\nAs well, ready access to handguns for self-defense by law-abiding\ncitizens was not endorsed in this report.  Although Seattle did\nexperience a higher rate of firearm death for self-defense, these\ncases accounted for less than 4% of the homicides in both cities\nduring the course of the study period.  And, as was reported,\nSeattle apparently didn't enjoy relief from any crime category\nover Vancouver because citizens may legally arm themselves for\nself-defense.\n\n\tHeavily quoted source: Handgun Regulation, Crime,\n\tAssaults, and Homicide: A Tale of Two Cities.\n\n\tJohn H.

{"text":"Classify the following data: From: Center for Policy Research <cpr>\nSubject: Symbiotics: Zionism-Antisemitism\n\n\nZionism and the Holocaust\n-------------------------- by Haim Bresheeth\n\nThe first point to note regarding the appropriation of the history\nof the Holocaust by Zionist propaganda is that Zionism without\nanti-semitism is impossible. Zionism agrees with the basic tenet\nof anti-Semitism, namely that Jews cannot live with non- Jews.\n\nThe history and roots of the Holocaust go back a long way. While\nthe industru of death and destruction did not operate before 1942,\nits roots were firmly placed in the 19th Century. Jewish\naspirations for emancipation emerged out of the national struggles\nin Europe. When the hopes for liberation through\nbourgeois-democratic change were dashed, other alternatives for\nimproving the lot of the Jews of Europe achieved prominence.\n\nThe socialist Bund, a mass movement with enormous following, had\nto contend with opposition from a new and small, almost\ninsignificant opponent, the political Zionists.  In outline these\ntwo offered diametrically opposed options for Jews in Europe.\nWhile the Bund was suggesting joining forces with the rest of\nEurope's workers, the Zionists were proposing a new programme\naimed at ridding Europe of its Jews by setting up some form of a\nJewish state.\n\nHistorically, nothing is inevitable, all depends on the balance of\nforces involved in the struggle. History can be seen as an option\ntree: every time a certain option is chosen, other routes become\nbarred. Because of that choice, movement backwards to the point\nbefore that choice was made is impossible. While Zionism as an\noption was taken by many young Jews, it remained a minority\nposition until the first days of the 3rd Reich. The Zionist\nFederation of Germany (ZVfD), an organisation representing a tiny\nminority of German Jews, was selected by the Nazis as the body to\nrepresent the Jews of the Reich. Its was the only flag of an\ninterantional organisation allowed to fly in Berlin, and this was\nthe only international organisation allowed to operate during this\nperiod. From a marginal position, the leaders of the Zionist\nFederation were propelled to a prominence and centrality that\nsurprised even them. All of a sudden they attained political\npower, power based not on representation, but from being selected\nas the choice of the Nazi regime for dealing with the the 'Jewish\nproblem'. Their position in negotiating with the Nazis agreements\nthat affected the lives of many tens of thousands of the Jews in\nGermany transformed them from a utopian, marginal organisation in\nGermany (and some other countries in Europe) into a real option to\nbe considered by German Jews.\n\nThe best example of this was the 'Transfer Agreement' of 1934.\nImmediately after the Nazi takeover in 1933, Jews all over the\nworld supported or were organising a world wide boycott of German\ngoods. This campaign hurt the Nazi regime and the German\nauthorities searched frantically for a way disabling the boycott.\nIt was clear that if Jews and Jewish organisations were to pull\nout, the campaign would collapse.\n\nThis problem was solved by the ZVfD. A letter sent to the Nazi\nparty as early as 21.  June 1933, outlined the degree of agreement\nthat existed between the two organisations on the question of\nrace, nation, and the nature of the 'Jewish problem', and it\noffered to collaborate with the new regime:\n\n\"The realisation of Zionism could only be hurt by resentment of\nJews abroad against the German development. Boycott propaganda -\nsuch as is currently being carried out against Germany in many\nways - is in essence unZionist, because Zionism wants not to do\nbattle but to convince and build.\"\n\nIn their eagerness to gain credence and the backing of the new\nregime, the Zionist organisation managed to undermine the boycott.\nThe main public act was the signature of the \"Transfer Agreement\"\nwith the Nazi authorities during the Zionist Congress of 1934. In\nessence, the agreement was designed to get Germany's Jews out of\nthe country and into Mandate Palestine. It provided a possibility\nfor Jews to take a sizeable part of their property out of the\ncountry, through a transfer of German goods to Palestine. This\nright was denied to Jews leaving to any other destination. The\nZionist organisation was the acting agent, through its financial\norganisations. This agreement operated on a number of fronts -\n'helping' Jews to leave the country, breaking the ring of the\nboycott, exporting German goods in large quantities to Palestine,\nand last but not least, enabling the regime to be seen as humane\nand reasonable even towards its avowed enemies, the Jews. After\nall, they argued, the Jews do not belong in Europe and now the\nJews come and agree with them.\n\nAfter news of the agreement broke, the boycott was doomed. If the\nZionist Organization found it possible and necessary to deal with\nthe Nazis, and import their goods, who could argue for a boycott ?\nThis was not the first time that the interests of both movements\nwere presented to the German public as complementary. Baron Von\nMildenstein, the first head of the Jewish Department of the SS,\nlater followed by Eichmann, was invited to travel to Palestine.\nThis he did in early 1933, in the company of a Zionist leader,\nKurt Tuchler. Having spent six months in Palestine, he wrote a\nseries of favourable articles in Der STURMER describing the 'new\nJew' of Zionism, a Jew Nazis could accept and understand.\n\nThis little-known episode established quite clearly the\nrelationship during the early days of Nazism, between the new\nregime and the ZVfD, a relationship that was echoed later in a\nnumber of key instances, even after the nature of the Final\nSolution became clear. In many cases this meant a silencing of\nreports about the horrors of the exterminations. A book\nconcentrating on this aspect of the Zionist reaction to the\nHolocaust is Post-Ugandan Zionism in the Crucible of the\nHolocaust, by S. B. Beth-Zvi.\n\nIn the case of the Kastner episode, around which Jim Allen's play\nPERDITION is based, even the normal excuse of lack of knowledge of\nthe real nature of events does not exist. It occured near the end\nof the war. The USSR had advanced almost up to Germany. Italy and\nthe African bases had been lost. The Nazis were on the run, with a\nnumber of key countries, such as Rumania, leaving the Axis. A\nsecond front was a matter of months away, as the western Allies\nprepared their forces. In the midst of all this we find Eichmann,\nthe master bureaucrat of industrial murder, setting up his HZ in\noccupied Budapest, after the German takeover of the country in\nApril 1944. His first act was to have a conference with the Jewish\nleadership, and to appoint Zionist Federation members, headed by\nKastner as the agent and clearing house for all Jews and their\nrelationship with the SS and the Nazr authorities. Why they did\nthis is not difficult to see. As opposed to Poland, where its\nthree and  a half million Jews lived in ghettoes and were visibly\ndifferent from the rest of the Polish population, the Hungarian\nJews were an integrated part of the community. The middle class\nwas mainly Jewish, the Jews were mainly middle-class. They enjoyed\nfreedom of travel, served in the Hungarian (fascist) army in\nfronline units, as officers and soldiers, their names were\nHungarian - how was Eichmann to find them if they were to be\nexterminated ? The task was not easy, there were a million Jews in\nHungary, most of them resident, the rest being refugees from other\ncountries. Many had  heard about the fate of Jews elsewhere, and\nwere unlikely to believe any statements by Nazi officials.\n\nLike elsewhere, the only people who had the information and the\near of the frightened Jewish population were the Judenrat. In this\ncase the Judenrat comprsied mainly the Zionist Federation members.\nWithout their help the SS, with 19 officers and less than 90 men,\nplus a few hundred Hungarian police, could not have collected and\ncontrolled a million Jews, when they did not even know their\nwhereabouts. Kastner and the others were left under no illusions.\nEichmann told Joel Brand, one of the members of Kastner's\ncommittee, that he intended to send all Hungary's Jews to\nAuschwitz, before he even started the expulsions!  He told them\nclearly that all these Jews will die, 12,000 a day, unless certain\nconditions were met.\n\nThe Committee faced a simple choice - to tell the Jews of Hungary\nabout their fate, (with neutral Rumania, where many could escape,\nbeing in most cases a few hours away) or to collaborate with the\nNazis by assisting in the concentration process. What would not\nhave been believed when coming from the SS, sounded quite\nplausible when coming from the mouths of the Zionist leadership.\nThus it is, that most of the Hungarian Jews went quietly to their\ndeath, assured by their leadership that they were to be sent to\nwork camps.\n\nTo be sure, there are thirty pieces of silver in this narrative of\ndestruction: the trains of 'prominents' which Eichmann promised to\nKastner - a promise he kept to the last detail. For Eichmann it\nwas a bargain: allowing 1,680 Jews to survive, as the price paid\nfor the silent collaboration over the death of almost a million\nJews.\n\nThere was no way in which the Jews of Hungary could even be\nlocated, not to say murdered, without the full collaboration of\nKastner and his few friends. No doubt the SS would hunt a few Jews\nhere and there, but the scale of the operation would have been\nminiscule compared to the half million who died in Auschwitz.\n\nIt is important to realise that Kastner was not an aberration,\nlike say Rumkovsky in Lodz. Kastner acted as a result of his\nstrongly held Zionist convictions. His actions were a logical\noutcome of earlier positions. This is instanced when he exposed to\nthe Gestapo the existence of a British cell of saboteurs, Palgi\nand Senesh, and persuaded them to give themselves up, so as not to\ndisrupt his operations. At no point during his trial or elsewhere,\ndid Kastner deny that he knew exactly what was to happen to those\nJews.","label":"talk.politics.mideast"}

(818) 354-5011\n\nContact:  Mary A. Hardin\n\nFOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE                              April 15, 1993\n#1506\n\n     Scientists at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory report the\nsuccessful flight of a balloon carrying instruments designed to\nmeasure and study chemicals in the Earth's ozone layer.\n\n     The April 3 flight from California's Barstow/Daggett Airport\nreached an altitude of 37 kilometers (121,000 feet) and took\nmeasurements as part of a program established to correlate data\nwith the Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite (UARS).  \n\n     The data from the balloon flight will also be compared to\nreadings from the Atmospheric Trace Molecular Spectroscopy\n(ATMOS) experiment which is currently flying onboard the shuttle\nDiscovery.\n\n     \"We launch these balloons several times a year as part of an\nongoing ozone research program.  In fact, JPL is actively\ninvolved in the study of ozone and the atmosphere in three\nimportant ways,\" said Dr. Jim Margitan, principal investigator on\nthe balloon research campaign.  \n\n     \"There are two JPL instruments on the UARS satellite,\" he\ncontinued.  \"The ATMOS experiment is conducted by JPL scientists,\nand the JPL balloon research provides collaborative ground truth\nfor those activities, as well as data that is useful in its own\nright.\"\n\n     The measurements taken by the balloon payload will add more\npieces to the complex puzzle of the atmosphere, specifically the\nmid-latitude stratosphere during winter and spring. \nUnderstanding the chemistry occurring in this region helps\nscientists construct more accurate computer models which are\ninstrumental in predicting future ozone conditions.\n\n     The scientific balloon payload consisted of three JPL\ninstruments:  an ultraviolet ozone photometer which measures\nozone as the balloon ascends and descends through the atmosphere;\na submillimeterwave limb sounder which looks at microwave\nradiation emitted by molecules in the atmosphere; and a Fourier\ntransform infrared interferometer which monitors how the\natmosphere absorbs sunlight. \n\n     Launch occurred at about noontime, and following a three-\nhour ascent, the balloon floated eastward at approximately 130\nkilometers per hour (70 knots).  Data was radioed to ground\nstations and recorded onboard.  The flight ended at 10 p.m.\nPacific time in eastern New Mexico when the payload was commanded\nto separate from the balloon.\n\n     \"We needed to fly through sunset to make the infrared\nmeasurements,\" Margitan explained, \"and we also needed to fly in\ndarkness to watch how quickly some of the molecules disappear.\"\n\n     It will be several weeks before scientists will have the\ncompleted results of their experiments.  They will then forward\ntheir data to the UARS central data facility at the Goddard Space\nFlight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland for use by the UARS\nscientists.    \n\n     The balloon was launched by the National Scientific Balloon\nFacility, normally based in Palestine, Tex., operating under a\ncontract from NASA's Wallops Flight Facility.  The balloon was\nlaunched in California because of the west-to-east wind direction\nand the desire to keep the operation in the southwest.\n\n     The balloons are made of 20-micron (0.8 mil, or less than\none-thousandth of an inch) thick plastic, and are 790,000 cubic\nmeters (28 million cubic feet) in volume when fully inflated with\nhelium (120 meters (400 feet) in diameter).  The balloons weigh\nbetween 1,300 and 1,800 kilograms (3,000 and 4,000 pounds).  The\nscientific payload weighs about 1,300 kilograms (3,000) pounds\nand is 1.8 meters (six feet) square by 4.6 meters (15 feet) high.\n\n     The JPL balloon research is sponsored by NASA's Upper\nAtmosphere Research Program and the UARS Correlative Measurements\nProgram.

Science is a human activity and as such,\nis subject to the same potential for distortion as any other human\nactivity.

Considering\n: the meaning of the word \"objective\" I doubt that this will ever happen.\n\n: So, back to the original question:\n\n: And objective morality is.....?\n\nThis may be an unfortunate choice of words, almost self-contradictory.\nObjective in the sense used here means something immutable and\nabsolute while morality describes the behavior of some group of\npeople. The first term is all inclusive, the second is specific. The\nconcept supposedly described may have meaning however. \nIf there is a God as described by the Christians (for instance), then\nHe has existence apart from and independent of humankind; His\nexistence is outside of our frame of reference (reality). If this\nbeing declares a thing to be so, it is -necessarily- so since He has\ndefined Himself as omnipotent and, if His claims are to be believed,\nHe is at least omnipotent relative to us. God is intrinsically\nself-defined and all reality is whatever He says it is - in an\nobjective sense.\nIf God determines a standard of conduct, that standard is objective.\nIf human beings are held accountable for their conformance to that\nstandard while permitted to ignore it, they substitute a relative\nmorality or mode of conduct, giving the term morality a nebulous,\nmeaningless sense that can be argued about by those pretending to\nmisunderstand. The standard is objective and the conduct required to\nmeet that standard is therefore objectively determined.\nJust because it is convenient to pretend that the term morality is\ninfinitely malleable, doesn't mean that the objective standard itself\ndoesn't exist. Morality has come to mean little more than a cultural\nnorm, or the preferred conduct of \"decent\" people, making it seem\nsubjective, but it is derived from an absolute, objective, standard.\nIronically, this objective standard is in perfect accord with our true\nnature (according to Christianity at least), yet is condemned as being\ncontrary to human nre, oppressive and severe.

{"text":"Classify the following data: \nTo start with, no methodology or form of reasoning is infallible.  So\nthere's a question of how much certainty we are willing to pay for in a\ngiven context.  Insistence on too much rigor bogs science down completely\nand makes progress impossible.  (Expenditure of sufficiently large sums\nof money and amounts of time can sometimes overcome this.)  On the other\nhand, with too little rigor much is lost by basing work on results which\neventually turn out to be false.  There is a morass of studies\ncontradicting other studies and outsiders start saying  \"You people call\nTHIS science?\"   (My opinion, for what it's worth, is that one sees both\nthese phenomena happening simultaneously in some parts of psychology.)  \n\nSome subjective judgement is required to decide on the level of rigor\nappropriate for a particular investigation.  I don't believe it is \never possible to banish subjective judgement from science.  \n\n\nMy second point, though, is that highly capable people can often make\nextremely reliable judgements about scientific validity even when using\nmethodology considered inadequate by the usual standards.  I think this\nis true of many scientists and I think it is true of many who approach\ntheir discipline in a way that is not generally recognized as scientific.\n\nWithin mathematics, I think there are several examples, especially before\nthe twentieth century.  One conspicuous case is that of Riemann, who is\nfamous for many theorems he stated but did not prove.  (Later \nmathematicians did prove them, of course.)  \n\nI think that for a good scientist, empirical investigation is often not\nso much a matter of determining what is true and what's not  as it is a \nmatter of convincing other people.  (People have proposed lots of \nincompatible definitions of science here, but I think the ability to \nobjectively convince others of the validity of one's results is an\nessential element.  Not that one can necessarily do that at every step \nof the scientific process, but I think that if one is not moving toward \nthat goal then one is not doing science.)\n\nWhen a person other than a scientist is quite good at what he does and\nseems to be very successful at it, I think that his judgements are also\nworthy of respect and that his assertions are well worth further\ninvestigation.  \n\n\nAdmittedly, my question was not at all well posed.  A considerable\namount of effort in a \"serious scholarly investigation\" such as I\nsuggested would be required simply to formulate an appropriately \nspecific question to try and answer.  \n\nThe \"science\" I was thinking of in my question is the actual science \ncurrently practiced now in the last decade of the twentieth century.  \nI certainly wasn't thinking of some idealized science or the mere use \nof \"reason and observation.\"\n\nOne thing I had in mind in my suggestion was the question as to whether\nin many cases the subjective judgements of skilled and experienced\npractitioners might be more reliable than statistical studies.  \n\nSince Russell Turpin seems to be much more familiar than I am with\nthe study of scientific methodology, perhaps he can tell us if there \nis any existing research related to this question.  \n\n--\nIn the arguments between behaviorists and cognitivists, psychology seems \nless like a science than a collection of competing religious sects.

There were 21 cases of civilians killing their \nattacker in self-defence. But such cases represent less that\n0.5% of the crimes prevented by armed self-defence; for every\ncase you cite, there were over 200 other cases of self-defence\nwhere the crime was prevented but the attacker was not killed.\n(0.5%, by the way, is the most conservative possible figure,\nbased on the National Crime Survey's estimate of 80,000\ncrimes prevented by armed self-defence each year.

{"text":"Classify the following data: The media is beating the incident at Dodger Stadium on Wednesday to\ndeath, but I haven't seen anything in rsb yet.\n\nGerald Perry of the Cardinals pinch hit in the eighth inning with two\non and his club down by a run.  He stroked a line drive into the\nright field corner.  The ball cleared the three-foot high fence and\nwent into the crowd.  Darryl, racing over from right center, got to\nthe spot in time to reach his glove up over the short fence, but he\nmissed the ball.  A fan sitting in the front row, wearing a mitt,\nreached up and caught the ball.  Home run.\n\nNow I've seen the replay several times and I have concluded that\nDarryl missed the ball, and that the fan's glove was essentially\nbehind Darryl's.  Several Dodger fans with seats in the immediate\nvicinity have claimed that the fan unquestionably interfered with\nStrawberry.  What cannot be disputed, however, is that the fan\nwho caught the ball never took his eye off it;  he was oblivious\nto where the fielder was playing.  He was also quite exuberant as\nsoon as he realized he had made the catch.\n\nThat exuberance disappeared immediately, however, when Strawberry\nwent into a tirade at the man.  All reports indicate he used a lot\nof profanity and accused the man of interference, and therefore of\ncosting the Dodgers a game.  Shortly afterwards other fans hurled\nfood and beverages toward the man who made the catch.  Dodger Stadium\nofficials started to remove him from the park, but then relented and\njust relocated him to another area.  In an interview after the game,\nLasorda blamed the fan for the loss.  Strawberry also went into a\ntirade about how the fans are stupid and they don't care about \nwinning.  L.A. Times columnists similarly blasted the man who made\nthe catch.\n\nBefore each Dodger game the public address announcer makes a speech\nwherein he says that fans are welcome to the souvenirs of balls that\nare hit into the stands as long as they do not interfere with any \nthat are in the field of play.  Was the fan wrong?  Should he have\nbeen more aware of the situation and acted to avoid any possibility\nof interference?  Or was he human and just reacting?  By the way, he\nis a season ticket holder and on his request the Dodgers have relocated\nhis seats to another area of the Stadium where future interference is\nimpossible.\n\nOthers have questioned why Darryl should be so concerned with what\nthe fan did when he has a grand total of 1 rbi through the first\nnine games.\n\nI question what he was doing in right center with a left-handed pull\nhitter up and the game on the line.  Had he been closer to the play,\nhe certainly would have had a much better chance of catching the ball.\n\nBut I guess the big debate continues as to what are the responsibilities\nof the fan.\n\n\n\n--\tThe Beastmaster\n\n\n","label":"rec.sport.baseball"}

{"text":"Classify the following data: Obesssive Compulsive Disorder (not to be confused with Obsessive Compulsive\n_Personality_ Disorder !) is an acute anxiety disorder characterized by\neither obsessions (persistent intrusive thoughts that cause anxiety when\nnot entertained), or compulsions (repetitive, ritualistic actions that\nsimilarly cause intense psychological discomfort when resisted).  \n\nOCD is often associated with certain forms of depression.  \n\nExamples of obsessive thoughts are repeated impulses to kill a loved\none (though not accompanied by anger), or a religious person having \nrecurrent blasphemous thoughts.  Generally, the individual attempts to ignore\nor suppress the intrusive thoughts by engaging in other activities.  \nThe individual realizes that the thoughts originate from the own mind, rather\nthan being from an external source.\n\nExamples of compulsive actions are constant repetitive hand washing,\nor other activity that is not realistically related to alleviating a\nsource of the anxiety.\n\nIn OCD, the obsessions or compulsions are highly distressing to the\nindividual, take an hour or more per day, and significantly impair their\ndaily routine and social relationships.\n\nTreatments include psychotherapy, behavioral methods, and sometimes\ncertain anti-depressants which have recently been found effective in alleviating\nobsessions and compulsions.\n\nThe standard diagnostic code for OCD, if you want to look it up in the\nDSM-III manual of psychiatric diagnosis is 300.30 .\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tkind regards,","label":"sci.med"}
{"text":"Classify the following data: From article <Apr.15.00.58.22.1993.28891@athos.rutgers.edu>, by ruthless@panix.com (Ruth Ditucci):\n\nI do hope that you are not suggesting that merely because a person\nreplies in an \"acrid, angry and sarcastic\" manner that this\ndemonstrates their 'non-christianity'?  The simple fact is that there\nis not a Christian on the face of the planet (that I know of!) that is\nperfect.  I have been known at times to have a fit of temper, or a\nsulk, but this does not make me any the less a Christian.\n\nOne of the points of being a Christian (as I perceive it) is to become\nMORE LIKE Christ.  This statement inherently suggests that we ARE NOT\nalready like Christ.  Jesus never unrighteously lost his temper.  I\ndo.  Jesus was perfect.  I'm not.\n\n\nYou must understand that this is because Christians often forget to\ntreat others as our role-model - Christ - would.  This is because we are\nhuman and falible.  I, for one, do not pretend to be infalible, and I\nhope that my fellow-men will bear with me when I make mistakes.  This\nsurely is not too much to ask, when I make every effort to bear with\n_them_.\n\n\n\nAnd don't we know it!\n\n\nAgain I say, we are ALL human!\n\nTo my brethren, this:  \n\nMs Duticci has a valid point and we as Christians ought to heed the\nwarning in her article.  We oftimes discredit ourselves and our\nSaviour, in the way that we treat others.  Strive towards the goal set\nus by our Lord, but in the meantime, remember :\n\n     \"There is no condemnation for those who are in Christ...\"\n\nWhen you blow it - go easy on yourself.  Forgive yourself, as your\nFather in heaven forgives you!  And remember - and this is something I\nfirmly beieve and cling to - one day, we shall see Him face to face,\nand in that day, we shall (finally!) be perfected.  \n\nI look forward to seeing you there.\n\n\n     RRRRR        OO       BBBBB          :\n     R    R     OO  OO     B    B         :\n     R     R   OO    OO    B    BB        :          Robert Pomeroy\n     R   RR    O      O    B    B         :\n     RRRR      O      O    BBBBB          :    u2i02@teach.cs.keele.ac.uk\n     R  R      O      O    B    B         :\n     R   R     OO    OO    B    BB        :              1993\n     R    R     OO  OO     B    B         :\n     R     R      OO       BBBBB          :\n\n\nPS  If you want to draw anything to my attention, then please mail me\ndirect, because I don't often read the news...","label":"soc.religion.christian"}

{"text":"Classify the following data: I experienced a sudden numbness in my left arm this morning.  Just after\nI completed my 4th set of deep squats.  Today was my weight training\nday and I was just beginning my routine.  All of a sudden at the end of\nthe 4th set my arm felt like it had gone to sleep.  It was cold, turned pale,\nand lost 60% of its strength.  The weight I used for squats wasn't that\nheavy, I was working hard but not at 100% effort.  I waited for a few \nminutes, trying to shake the arm back to life and then continued with\nchest exercises (flyes) with lighter dumbells than I normally use.  But\nI dropped the left dumbell during the first set, and experienced continued\narm weakness into the second.  So I quit training and decided not to do my\nusual hour on the ski machine either.  I'll take it easy for the rest of\nthe day.\n\nMy arm is *still* somewhat numb and significantly weaker than normal --\nmy hand still tingles a bit down to the thumb. Color has returned to normal\nand it is no longer cold. \n\nHorrid thoughts of chunks of plaque blocking a major artery course through\nmy brain.  I'm 34, vegetarian, and pretty fit from my daily exercise\nregimen.  So that can't be it.  Could a pinched nerve from the bar\ncause these symptoms (I hope)?\n\nHas this happened to anyone else?\nNothing like this has ever happened to me before.  Does it come with age?\n\nThanks,\nTom","label":"sci.med"}

The reason that people bash WASP's is \nbecause they have been on top for a long time. Whoever is on top is\ngoing to oppress whoever is below them so that they can stay on top.\nIf Hannibal had pushed on to Rome after his victory at Cannae we might\nall be bashing the blacks for oppressing us peacefull white people \nfor all these centuries. I seriously doubt that if the blacks had \nconquered the world that they would have treated their colonies any\nbetter/worse than the whites did.\n\tThe white race did some unspeakable things to the other races of\nthe world. But they only did what any other conquering race would have done\n(ie. Khan). The real question is, should we carry over that blame to the\npresent generation who didn't participate in the crimes? Would it do \nany good? Has it done Bosnia any good?

Winning, in high school and\nafter high school, is still the best way to be popular, but it doesn't make\nyou right.

{"text":"Classify the following data: SSF is up for redesign again.  Let's do it right this\ntime!  Let's step back and consider the functionality we want:\n\n[1] microgravity/vacuum process research\n[2] life sciences research (adaptation to space)\n[3] spacecraft maintenence \n\nThe old NASA approach, explified by Shuttle and SSF so far, was to\ncentralize functionality.  These projects failed to meet\ntheir targets by a wide margin: the military and commercial users \ntook most of their payloads off Shuttle after wasting much effort to \ntie their payloads to it, and SSF has crumbled into disorganization\nand miscommunication.  Over $50 billion has been spent on these\ntwo projects with no reduction in launch costs and littel improvement\nin commercial space industrialization.  Meanwhile, military and commercial \nusers have come up with a superior strategy for space development: the \nconstellation.  \n\nFirstly, different functions are broken down into different \nconstellations placed in the optimal orbit for each function:\nthus we have the GPS/Navstar constellation in 12-hour orbits,\ncomsats in Clarke and Molniya orbits, etc.  Secondly, the task\nis distributed amongst several spacecraft in a constellation,\nproviding for redundancy and full coverage where needed.\n\nSSF's 3 main functions require quite different environments\nand are also prime candidates for constellization.\n\n[1] We have the makings of a microgravity constellation now:\nCOMET and Mir for long-duration flights, Shuttle/Spacelab for\nshort-duration flights.  The best strategy for this area is\ninexpensive, incremental improvement: installation of U.S. facilities \non Mir, Shuttle/Mir linkup, and transition from Shuttle/Spacelab\nto a much less expensive SSTO/Spacehab/COMET or SSTO/SIF/COMET.\nWe might also expand the research program to take advantage of \ninteresting space environments, eg the high-radiation Van Allen belt \nor gas/plasma gradients in comet tails.  The COMET system can\nbe much more easily retrofitted for these tasks, where a \nstation is too large to affordably launch beyond LEO.\n\n[2] We need to study life sciences not just in microgravity,\nbut also in lunar and Martian gravities, and in the radiation\nenvironments of deep space instead of the protected shelter\nof LEO.  This is a very long-term, low-priority project, since\nastronauts will have little practical use in the space program\nuntil costs come down orders of magnitude.  Furthermore, using\nastronauts severely restricts the scope of the investigation,\nand the sample size.  So I propose LabRatSat, a constellation\ntether-bolo satellites that test out various levels of gravity\nin super-Van-Allen-Belt orbits that are representative of the\nradiation environment encountered on Earth-Moon, Earth-Mars,\nEarth-asteroid, etc. trips.  The miniaturized life support\nmachinery might be operated real-time from earth thru a VR\ninterface.  AFter several orbital missions have been flown,\nfollow-ons can act as LDEFs on the lunar and Martian surface,\ntesting out the actual environment at low cost before $billions\nare spent on astronauts.\n\n[3] By far the largest market for spacecraft servicing is in \nClarke orbit.  I propose a fleet of small teleoperated\nrobots and small test satellites on which ground engineers can\npractice their skills.  Once in place, robots can pry stuck\nsolar arrays and antennas, attach solar battery power packs,\ninject fuel, etc.  Once the fleet is working, it can be\nspun off to commercial company(s) who can work with the comsat\ncompanies to develop comsat replaceable module standards.\n\nBy applying the successful constellation strategy, and getting\nrid of the failed centralized strategy of STS and old SSF, we\nhave radically improved the capability of the program while\ngreatly cutting its cost.  For a fraction of SSF's pricetag,\nwe can fix satellites where the satellites are, we can study\nlife's adaptation to a much large & more representative variety \nof space environments, and we can do microgravity and vacuum\nresearch inexpensively and, if needed, in special-purpose\norbits.\n\nN.B., we can apply the constellation strategy to space exploration\nas well, greatly cutting its cost and increasing its functionality.  \nMars Network and Artemis are two good examples of this; more ambitiously \nwe can set up a network of native propellant plants on Mars that can be used\nto fuel planet-wide rover/ballistic hopper prospecting and\nsample return.  The descendants of LabRatSat's technology can\nbe used as a Mars surface LDEF and to test out closed-ecology\ngreenhouses on Mars at low cost.\n\n","label":"sci.space"}

{"text":"Classify the following data: \nI strongly disagree that absolute truth would not require interpretation.\nThat's because truth may be absolute, but it may not be obvious.  Like\nso many things, the truth is always subject to misinterpretation.\n\nI strongly suspect that we are reaching an impasse here, which is why I\ndeign from commenting much further.\n\n\nNow hold it.  I never said that Christians cannot be arrogant.  Indeed, as\nmany other Christians on SRC have stressed before, this is a trap that\nChristians must always be wary about.  However, this does not mean that if\nyou believe in the absolutes established by the Bible, you are necessarily\nbeing arrogant.  A Christian can believe that the Word of God is absolute,\nbut he or she should not expect this to be immediately evident to everyone.\n \n\nNot quite.  You say that according to my stance, we cannot *reliably*\ndetermine what is true.  That is not what I said.  I say that as fallible\nhuman beings, we cannot discern the truth with 100% certainty.  The \ndistinction is subtle yet important.\n\nWhen a scientist performs an experiment, he can claim that his results\nare reliable, without claiming that absolutely no mistake whatsoever could\nhave been made.  In other words, he can admit that he could be mistaken,\nwithout sacrificing his convictions.\n\nNobody can establish what absolute truth is with 100% certainty.\nThroughout the centuries, philosophers have argued about what we can know\nwith complete certainty and what we cannot.  Descartes made a step in the\nright direction when he uttered, \"Cogito, ergo sum,\" yet we have not advanced\nmuch beyond that.\n\nDo you believe that other people aside from you exist?  Do you believe that\nthe computer terminal you are using exists?  If so, can you be absolutely\ncertain about that?  Are you sure it is not some grand illusion?  Of course,\nyou have no such assurance.  This does not mean, however, that for all\npractical purposes, you can be certain that they exist.  So it is with\nChristianity.  The most mature Christians I know have deep convictions about\nabsolute morality, yet they acknowledge that there is a non-zero probability \nthat they are wrong.  This does not, however, mean that they should (or do) \nabandon these absolutes.\n\n\nAs I said, we can never be absolutely certain that we are correct.  This does\nnot mean that we cannot be certain enough, in light of the evidence, to \nrender all doubts unreasonable.\n","label":"soc.religion.christian"}

What \nwas he killed for. He hadn't hurt anyone, hadn't said any word he oughtn't \nhave. Why did they kill him? I want to find out--from here, from there, from \nthe government--why my husband was killed.\n\nOn the 27th, when I returned from work--it was a Saturday--my son was at home.\nHe doesn't work. I went straight to the kitchen, and he called me, \"Mamma, is \nthere a soccer game?\" There were shouts from Lenin Street. That's where we \nlived. I say, \"I don't know, Igor, I haven't turned on the TV.\" He looked \nagain and said, \"Mamma, what's going on in the courtyard?!\" I look and see so \nmany people, it's awful, marching, marching, there are hundreds, thousands, \nyou can't even tell how many there are. They're shouting, \"Down with the \nArmenians! Kill the Armenians! Tear the Armenians to pieces!\" My God, why is \nthat happening, what for? I had known nothing at that point. We lived together\nwell, in friendship, and suddenly something like this. It was completely \nunexpected. And they were shouting, \"Long live Turkey!\" And they had flags,\nand they were shouting. There was a man walking in front well dressed, he's \naround 40 or 45, in a gray raincoat. He is walking and saying something, I \ncan't make it out through the vent window. He is walking and saying something,\nand the children behind him are shouting, \"Tear the Armenians to pieces!\" and \n\"Down with the Armenians!\" They shout it again, and then shout, \"Hurrah!\" The \npeople streamed without end, they were walking in groups, and in the groups I \nsaw that there were women, too. I say, \"My God, there are women there too!\" \nAnd my son says, \"Those aren't women, Mamma, those are bad women.\" Well we \ndidn't look a long time. They were walking and shouting and I was afraid, I \nsimply couldn't sit still. I went out onto the balcony, and my Azerbaijani \nneighbor is on the other balcony, and I say, \"Khalida, what's going on, what \nhappened?\" She says, \"Emma, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know what \nhappened.\" Well she was quite frightened too. They had these white sticks, \neach second or third one had a white rod. They're waving the rods above their \nheads as they walk, and the one who's out front, like a leader, he has a white\nstick too. Well maybe it was an armature shaft, but what I saw was white, I \ndon't know.\n\nMy husband got home 10 or 15 minutes later. He comes home and I say, \"Oh \ndear, I'm frightened, they're going to kill us I bet.\" And he says, \"What are \nyou afraid of, they're just children.\" I say, \"Everything that happens comes \nfrom children.\" There had been 15- and 16-year kids from the Technical and \nVocational School. \"Don't fear,\" he said, \"it's nothing, nothing all that \nbad.\" He didn't eat, he just lay on the sofa. And just then on television they\nbroadcast that two Azerbaijanis had been killed in Karabakh, near Askeran. \nWhen I heard that I couldn't settle down at all, I kept walking here and \nthere and I said, \"They're going to kill us, the Azerbaijanis are going to \nkill us.\" And he says, \"Don't be afraid.\" Then we heard--from the central \nsquare, there are women shouting near near the stage, well, they're shouting\ndifferent things, and you couldn't hear every well. I say, \"You speak\nAzerbaijani well, listen to what they're saying.\" He says \"Close the window\nand go to bed, there s nothing happening there.\" He listened a bit and then \nclosed the window and went to bed, and told us, \"Come on, go to sleep, it's\nnothing.\" Sleep, what did he mean sleep?  My Son and I stood at the window\nuntil two in the morning watching. Well he's sick, and all of this was\naffecting him. I say, \"Igor, you go to bed, I'm going to go to bed in a minute\ntoo.\" He went and I sat at the window until three, and then went to bed. \nThings had calmed down slightly.\n\nThe 28th, Sunday, was my day off. My husband got up and said, \"Come on, Emma, \nget up.\" I say, \"Today's my day off, let me rest.\" He says, \"Aren't you going \nto make me some tea?\" Well I felt startled and got up, and said, \"Where are \nyou going?\" He says, \"I'm going out, I have to.\" I say, \"Can you really go \noutside on a day like today? Don't go out, for God's sake. You never listen to\nme, I know, and you're not going to listen to me now, but at least don't take \nthe car out of the garage, go without the car.\" And he says, \"Come on, close \nthe door!\" And then on the staircase he muttered something, I couldn't make it\nout, he probably said \"coward\" or something.\n\nI closed the door and he left. And I started cleaning . . . picking things up\naround the house . . . Everything seemed quiet until one o'clock in the after-\nnoon, but at the bus station, my neighbor told me, cars were burning. I said,\n\"Khalida, was it our car?\" She says, \"No, no, Emma, don't be afraid, they\nwere government cars and Zhigulis.'' Our car is a GAZ-21 Volga. And I waited,\nit was four o'clock, five o'clock . . . and when he wasn't home at seven I\nsaid, \"Oh, they've killed Shagen!\"\n\nTires are burning in town, there's black smoke in town, and I'm afraid, I'm \nstanding on the balcony and I'm all . . . my whole body is shaking. My God, \nthey've probably killed him! So basically I waited like that until ten \no'clock and he still hadn't come home. And I'm afraid to go out. At ten\no'clock I look out: across from our building is a building with a bookstore,\nand from upstairs, from the second floor, everything is being thrown outside. \nI'm looking out of one window and Igor is looking out of the other, and I \ndon't want him to see this, and he, as it turns out, doesn't want me to see \nit. We wanted to hide it from one another. I joined him. \"Mamma,\" he says,\n\"look what they're doing over there!\" They were burning everything, and there \nwere police standing there, 10 or 15 of them, maybe twenty policemen standing \non the side, and the crowd is on the other side, and two or three people are \nthrowing everything down from the balcony. And one of the ones on the balcony \nis shouting, \"What are you standing there for, burn it!\" When they threw the \ntelevision, wow, it was like a bomb! Our neighbor on the third floor came out \non her balcony and shouted, \"Why are you doing that, why are you burning those\nthings, those people saved with such difficulty to buy those things for their \nhome. Why are you burning them?\" And from the courtyard they yell at her, \"Go \ninside, go inside! Instead why don't you tell us if they are any of them in \nyour building or not?\" They meant Armenians, but they didn't say Armenians, \nthey said, \"of them.\" She says, \"No, no, no, none!\" Then she ran downstairs to\nour place, and says, \"Emma, Emma, you have to leave!\" I say, \"They've killed\nShagen anyway, what do we have to live for? It won't be living for me without \nShagen. Let them kill us, too!\" She insists, saying, \"Emma, get out of here, \ngo to Khalida's, and give me the key. When they come I'll say that it's my \ndaughter's apartment, that they're off visiting someone.\" I gave her the key \nand went to the neighbor's, but I couldn't endure it. I say, \"Igor, you stay \nhere, I'm going to go downstairs, and see, maybe Papa's . . . Papa's there.\"\n\nMeanwhile, they were killing the two brothers, Alik and Valery [Albert and \nValery Avanesians; see the accounts of Rima Avanesian and Alvina Baluian], in \nthe courtyard. There is a crowd near the building, they're shouting, howling, \nand I didn't think that they were killing at the time. Alik and Valery lived\nin the corner house across from ours. When I went out into the courtyard I saw\nan Azerbaijani, our neighbor, a young man about 30 years old. I say, \"Madar, \nUncle Shagen's gone, let's go see, maybe he's dead in the garage or near the \ngarage, let's at least bring the corpse into the house. \"He shouts, \"Aunt \nEmma, where do you think you're going?! Go back into the house, I'll look for \nhim.\" I say, \"Something will happen to you, too, because of me, no, Madar, \nI'm coming too.\" Well he wouldn't let me go all the same, he says, \"You stay \nhere with us, I'm go look.\" He went and looked, and came back and said, \"Aunt \nEmma, there's no one there, the garage is closed. \"Madar went off again and \nthen returned and said, \"Aunt Emma, they're already killed Alik, and Valery's \nthere . . . wheezing.\"\n\nMadar wanted to go up to him, but those scoundrels said, \"Don't go near him, \nor we'll put you next to him.\" He got scared--he's young--and came back and \nsaid, \"I'm going to go call, maybe an ambulance will come, at least to take \nAlik, maybe he'll live . . . \" They grew up together in our courtyard, they \nknew each other well, they had always been on good terms. He went to call, but\nnot a single telephone worked, they had all been shut off. He called, and \ncalled, and called, and called--nothing.\n\nI went upstairs to the neighbor's. Igor says, \"Two police cars drove up over \nthere, their headlights are on, but they're not touching them, they are still \nlying where they were, they're still lying there . . . \"We watched out the\nwindow until four o'clock, and then went downstairs to our apartment. I didn't\ntake my clothes off. I lay on the couch so as not to go to bed, and at six\no'clock in the morning I got up and said, \"Igor, you stay here at home, don't\ngo out, don't go anywhere, I'm going to look, I have to find Papa, dead or\nalive . . . let me go . . . I've got the keys from work.\"\n\nAt six o'clock I went to the Emergency Hospital. The head doctor and another \ndoctor opened the door to the morgue. I run up to them and say, \"Doctor, is \nShagen there?\" He says, \"What do you mean? Why should Shagen be here?!\" I \nwanted to go in, but he wouldn't let me. There were only four people in there,\nthey said. Well, they must have been awful because they didn't let me in. They\nsaid, \"Shagen's not here, he's alive somewhere, he'll come back.\"\n\nIt's already seven o'clock in the morning. I look and there is a panel truck\nwith three policemen. Some of our people from the hospital were there with\nthem. I say, \"Sara Baji [\"Sister\" Sara, term of endearment], go look, they've\nprobably brought Shagen.\" I said it, shouted it, and she went and came back\nand says, \"No, Emma, he has tan shoes on, it's a younger person.\" Now Shagen \njust happened to have tan shoes, light tan, they were already old. When they \nsaid it like that I guessed immediately. I went and said, \"Doctor, they've \nbrought Shagen in dead.\" He says, \"Why are you carrying on like that, dead, \ndead . . . he's alive.\" But then he went all the same, and when he came back \nthe look on his face was . . . I could tell immediately that he was dead. They\nknew one another well, Shagen had worked for him a long time. I say, \"Doctor, \nis it Shagen?\" He says, \"No, Emma, it's not he, it's somebody else entirely.\" \nI say, \"Doctor, why are you deceiving me, I'll find out all the same anyway, \nif not today, then tomorrow.\" And he said . . . I screamed, right there in the\noffice. He says, \"Emma, go, go calm down a little.\" Another one of our \ncolleagues said that the doctor had said it was Shagen, but . . . in hideous \ncondition. They tried to calm me down, saying it wasn't Shagen. A few minutes \nlater another colleague comes in and says, \"Oh, poor Emma!\" When she said it \nlike that there was no hope left.\n\n   That day was awful. They were endlessly bringing in dead and injured \npeople.\n\nAt night someone took me home. I said, \"Igor, Papa's been killed.\"\n\nOn the morning of the 1st I left Igor at home again and went to the hospital: \nI had to bury him somehow, do something. I look and see that the hospital is \nsurrounded by soldiers. They are wearing dark clothes. \"Hey, citizen, where \nare you going?\" I say, \"I work here,\" and from inside someone shouts, \"Yes, \nyes, that's our cook, let her in.\" I went right to the head doctor's office\nand there is a person from the City Health Department there, he used to\nwork with us at the hospital. He says, \"Emma, Shagen's been taken to Baku.\nIn the night they took the wounded and the dead, all of them, to Baku.\" I\nsay, \"Doctor, how will I bury him?\" He says, \"We're taking care of all that,\ndon't you worry, we'll do everything, we'll tell you about it. Where did you\nspend the night?\" I say, \"I was at home.\" He says, \"What do you mean you\nwere at home?! You were at home alone?\" I say, \"No, Igor was there too.\" He\nsays, \"You can't stay home, we're getting an ambulance right now, wait just\none second, the head doctor is coming, we're arranging an ambulance right\nnow, you put on a lab coat and take one for Igor, you go and bring Igor here\nlike a patient, and you'll stay here and we'll se~ later what to do next ...\"\nHis last name is Kagramanov. The head doctor's name is Izyat Jamalogli\nSadukhov.\n\nThe \"ambulance\" arrived and I went home and got Igor. They admitted him as a \npatient, they gave us a private room, an isolation room. We stayed in the \nhospital until the 4th.\n\nSome police car came and they said, \"Emma, let's go.\" And the women, our \ncolleagues, then they saw the police car, became anxious and said, \"Where are \nyou taking her?\" I say, \"They're going to kill me, too . . . \" And the\ninvestigator says, \"Why are you saying that, we're going to make a positive\nidentification.\" We went to Baku and they took me into the morgue . . . I\nstill can't remember what hospital it was . . . The investigator says, \"Let's \ngo, we need to be certain, maybe it's not Shagen.\" And when I saw the caskets,\nlying on top of one another, I went out of my mind. I say, \"I can't look, no.\"\nThe investigator says, \"Are there any identifying marks?\" I say, \"Let me see\nthe clothes, or the shoes, or even a sock, I'll recognize them.\" He says, \n\"Isn't they're anything on his body?\" I say he has seven gold teeth and his \nfinger, he only has half of one of his fingers. Shagen was a carpenter, he had\nbeen injured at work . . .\n\nThey brought one of the sleeves of the shirt and sweater he was wearing, they \nbrought them and they were all burned . . . When I saw them I shouted, \"Oh, \nthey burned him!\" I shouted, I don't know, I fell down . . . or maybe I sat \ndown, I don't remember. And that investigator says, \"Well fine, fine, since \nwe've identified that these are his clothes, and since his teeth . . . since\nhe has seven gold teeth . . . \"\n\nOn the 4th they told me: \"Emma, it's time to bury Shagen now.\" I cried, \"How, \nhow can I bury Shagen when I have only one son and he's sick? I should inform \nhis relatives, he has three sisters, I can't do it by myself.\" They say, \"OK, \nyou know the situation. How will they get here from Karabagh? How will they \nget here from Yerevan? There's no transportation, it s impossible.\"\n\nHe was killed on February 28, and I buried him on March 7. We buried him in \nSumgait. They asked me, \"Where do you want to bury him?\" I said, \"I want to \nbury him in Karabagh, where we were born, let me bury him in Karabagh,\" I'm \nshouting, and the head of the burial office, I guess, says, \"Do you know what \nit means, take him to Karabagh?! It means arson!\" I say, \"What do you mean, \narson? Don't they know what's going on in Karabagh? The whole world knows that\nthey killed them, and I want to take him to Karabagh, I don't have anyone \nanymore.\" I begged, I pleaded, I grieved, I even got down on my knees. He\nsays, \"Let's bury him here now, and in three months, in six months, a year, \nif it calms down, I'll help you move him to Karabagh . . . \"\n\nOur trial was the first in Sumgait. It was concluded on May 16. At the\ninvestigation the murderer, Tale Ismailov, told how it all happened, but then\nat the trial he . . . tried to wriggle . . . he tried to soften his crime. \nThen they brought a videotape recorder, I guess, and played it, and said, \n\"Ismailov, look, is that you?\" He says, \"Yes.\" \"Well look, here you're \ndescribing everything as it was on the scene of the crime, right?\" He says, \n\"Yes.\" \"And now you're telling it differently?\" He says, \"Well maybe I \nforgot!\" Like that.\n\nThe witnesses and that criminal creep himself said that when the car was going\nalong Mir Street, there was a crowd of about 80 people . . . Shagen had a \nVolga GAZ-21. The 80 people surrounded his car, and all 80 of them were \ninvolved. One of them was this Ismailov guy, this Tale. They--it's unclear\nwho--started pulling Shagen out of the car. Well, one says from the left side\nof the car, another says from the right side. They pulled off his sports \njacket. He had a jacket on. Well they ask him, \"What's your nationality?\" He \nsays, \"Armenian.\" Well they say from the crowd they shouted, \"If he's an\nArmenian, kill him, kill him!\" They started beating him, they broke seven of\nhis ribs, and his heart . . . I don't know, they did something there, too \n. . . it's too awful to tell about. Anyway, they say this Tale guy . . . he \nhad an armature shaft. He says, \"I picked it up, it was lying near a bush, \nthat's where I got it.\" He said he picked it up, but the witnesses say that he\nhad already had it. He said, \"I hit him twice,\" he said, \" . . . once or twice\non the head with that rod.\" And he said that when he started to beat him \nShagen was sitting on the ground, and when he hit him he fell over. He said, \n\"I left, right nearby they were burning things or something in an apartment,\nkilling someone,\" he says, \"and I came back to look, is that Shagen alive or\nnot?\" I said, \"You wanted to finish him, right, and if he was still alive, you\ncame back to hit him again?\" He went back and looked and he was already dead.\n\"After that,\" that bastard Tale said, \"after that I went home.\"\n\nI said, \"You . . . you . . . little snake,\" I said, \"Are you a thief and a \nmurderer?\" Shagen had had money in his jacket, and a watch on his wrist. They\nwere taken. He says he didn't take them\n\nWhen they overturned and burned the car, that Tale was no longer there, it was\nother people who did that. Who it was, who turned over the car and who burned\nit, that hasn't been clarified as yet. I told the investigator, \"How can you \nhave the trial when you don't know who burned the car?\" He said something, but\nI didn't get what he was saying. But I said, \"You still haven't straightened \neverything out, I think that's unjust.\"\n\nWhen they burned the car he was lying next to it, and the fire spread to him. \nIn the death certificate it says that he had third-degree burns over 80\npercent of his body . . .\n\nAnd I ask again, why was he killed? My husband was a carpenter; he was a good \ncraftsman, he knew how to do everything, he even fixed his own car, with his \nown hands. We have three children. Three sons. Only Igor was with me at the \ntime. The older one was in Pyatigorsk, and the younger one is serving in the \nArmy. And now they're fatherless...\n\nI couldn't sit all the way through it. When the Procurator read up to 15\nyears' deprivation of freedom, I just . . . I went out of my mind, I didn't\nknow what to do with myself, I said, \"How can that be? You,\" I said, \"you are \nsaying that it was intentional murder and the sentence is 15 years' \ndeprivation of freedom?\" I screamed, I had my mind! I said, \"Let me at that\ncreep, with my bare hands I'll . . . \" A relative restrained me, and there\nwere all those military people there . . . I lest. I said,\" This isn't a \nSoviet trial, this is unjust!\" That's what I shouted, l said it and left . . .\n\nI said that on February 27, when those people were streaming down our street, \nthey were shouting, \"Long live Turkey!\" and \"Glory to Turkey!\" And during the \ntrial I said to that Ismailov, \"What does that mean, 'Glory to Turkey'?\" I \nstill don't understand what Turkey has to do with this, we live in the Soviet \nUnion. That Turkey told you to or is going to help you kill Armenians? I still\ndon't understand why \"Glory to Turkey!\" I asked that question twice and got no\nanswer . . . No one answered me . . .\n\n   May 19, 1988\n   Yerevan\n\n\t\t     - - - reference - - -\n\n[1] _The Sumgait Tragedy; Pogroms against Armenians in Soviet Azerbaijan,\n    Volume I, Eyewitness Accounts_, edited by Samuel Shahmuradian, forward by\n    Yelena Bonner, 1990, published by Aristide D.

{"text":"Classify the following data: Archive-name: typing-injury-faq/software\nVersion: 1.8, 7th December 1992\n\nThis FAQ is actually maintained by Richard Donkin <richardd@hoskyns.co.uk>.\nI post it, along with the other FAQ stuff.  If you have questions, you want\nto send mail to Richard, not me.  -- Dan\n \n \n\t\t    Software Tools to help with RSI\n\t\t    -------------------------------\n \nThis file describes tools, primarily software, to help prevent or manage RSI.\nThis version now includes information on such diverse tools as calendar\nprograms and digital watches...\n \nPlease let me know if you know any other tools, or if you have information\nor opinions on these ones, and I will update this FAQ.\n\nI am especially interested in getting reviews of these products from people\nwho have evaluated them or are using them.  \n \nRichard Donkin                           \nInternet mail: richardd@hoskyns.co.uk              \nTel: +44 71 814 5708 (direct)\nFax: +44 71 251 2853\n\nChanges in this version:\n\n     Added information on StressFree, another typing management tool \n     for Windows.\n\n\nTYPING MANAGEMENT TOOLS: these aim to help you manage your keyboard use,\nby warning you to take a break every so often.  The better ones also include\nadvice on exercises, posture and workstation setup.  Some use sound hardware to\n \nwarn of a break, others use beeps or screen messages.\n\nOften, RSI appears only after many years of typing, and the pain has\na delayed action in the short term too: frequently you can be typing\nall day with little problem and the pain gets worse in the evening.\nThese tools act as an early warning system: by listening to their\nwarnings and taking breaks with exercises, you don't have to wait for your \nbody to give you a more serious and painful warning - that is, getting RSI.\n\n \n    Tool: At Your Service (commercial software)\n    Available from:\n\tBright Star\n\tTel: +1 (206) 451 3697\n    Platforms: Mac (System 6.0.4), Windows\n    Description:\n\tProvides calendar, keyboard watch, email watch, and system info. \n\tWarns when to take a break (configurable).  Has a few recommendations\n\ton posture, and exercises.  Sound-oriented, will probably work best \n\twith sound card (PC) or with microphone (Mac).  Should be possible\n\tto record your own messages to warn of break.\n \n    Tool: AudioPort (sound card and software)\n    Available from:\n\tMedia Vision\n\tTel: +1 (510) 226 2563\n    Platforms: PC\n    Description:\n\tA sound card to plug into your PC parallel port.\n\tIncludes 'At Your Service'.\n \n    Tool: Computer Health Break (commercial software)\n    Available from:\n\tEscape Ergonomics, Inc\n\t1111 W. El Camino Real\n\tSuite 109\n\tMailstop 403\n\tSunnyvale, CA\n\tTel: +1 (408) 730 8410\n    Platforms: DOS\n    Description:\n\tAimed at preventing RSI, this program warns you to take\n\tbreaks after a configurable interval, based on clock time, or\n\tafter a set number of keystrokes -- whichever is earlier.\n\tIt gives you 3 exercises to do each time, randomly selected from\n\ta set of 70.  Exercises are apparently tuned to the type of work\n\tyou do - data entry, word processing, information processing.\n\tExercises are illustrated and include quite a lot of text on\n\thow to do the exercise and on what exactly the exercise does.\n\n\tCHB includes hypertext information on RSI that you can use \n\tto learn more about RSI and how to prevent it.  Other information\n\ton non-RSI topics can be plugged into this hypertext viewer.\n\tA full glossary of medical terms and jargon is included.\n\n\tCHB can be run in a DOS box under Windows, but does not then\n\twarn you when to take a break; it does not therefore appear\n\tuseful when used with Windows.\n\n\tCost: $79.95; quantity discounts, site licenses.\n\n    Comments:\n\tThe keystroke-counting approach looks good: it seems better\n\tto measure the activity that is causing you problems than to\n\tmeasure clock time or even typing time.  The marketing stuff\n\tis very good and includes some summaries of research papers,\n\tas well as lots of arguments you can use to get your company \n\tto pay up for RSI management tools.  \n\n    Tool: EyerCise (commercial software)\n    Available from:\n\tRAN Enterprises\n\tOne Woodland Park Dr.\n\tHaverhill, MA  01830, US\n\tTel: 800-451-4487 (US only)\n    Platforms: Windows (3.0/3.1), OS/2 PM (1.3/2.0) [Not DOS]\n    Description:\n\tAimed at preventing RSI and eye strain, this program warns you to take\n\tbreaks after a configurable interval (or at fixed times). Optionally\n\tdisplays descriptions and pictures of exercises - pictures are\n\tanimated and program beeps you to help you do exercises at the\n\tcorrect rate.  Includes 19 stretches and 4 visual training \n\texercises, can configure which are included and how many repetitions\n\tyou do - breaks last from 3 to 7 minutes.  Also includes online help \n\ton workplace ergonomics.  \n\n\tQuote from their literature:\n\n\t\"EyerCise is a Windows program that breaks up your day with periodic\n\tsets of stretches and visual training exercises.  The stretches work\n\tall parts of your body, relieving tension and helping to prevent\n\tRepetitive Strain Injury.  The visual training exercises will improve\n\tyour peripheral vision and help to relieve eye strain.  Together these\n\thelp you to become more relaxed and productive.\"\n \n\t\"The package includes the book _Computers & Visual Stress_ by Edward C.\n\tGodnig, O.D. and John S. Hacunda, which describes the ergonomic setup\n\tfor a computer workstation and provides procedures and exercises to\n\tpromote healthy and efficient computer use. \n\t\n\tCost: $69.95 including shipping and handling, quantity discounts\n\tfor resellers.  Free demo ($5 outside US).\n \n    Comments:\n\tI have a copy of this, and it works as advertised: I would say\n\tit is better for RSI prevention than RSI management, because it\n\tdoes not allow breaks at periods less than 30 minutes.  Also, it\n\tinterrupts you based on clock time rather than typing time, which\n\tis not so helpful unless you use the keyboard all day.  Worked OK on\n\tWindows 3.0 though it did occasionally crash with a UAE - not sure\n\twhy. Also refused to work with the space bar on one PC, and has\n\tone window without window controls.  Very usable though, and does not\n\trequire any sound hardware.\n\n    Tool: Lifeguard (commercial software)\n    Available from:\n\tVisionary Software\n\tP.O. Box 69447\n\tPortland, OR  97201, US\n\tTel: +1 (503) 246-6200\n    Platforms: Mac, DOS (Windows version underway)\n    Description:\n\tAimed at preventing RSI.  Warns you to take a break\n\twith dialog box and sound.  Includes a list of exercises\n\tto do during breaks, and information on configuring your\n\tworkstation in an ergonomic manner.  Price: $59;\n\tquantity discounts and site licenses.  The DOS product is\n\tbought in from another company, apparently; not sure how\n\tequivalent this is to the Mac version.\n\t\n\tThe Mac version got a good review in Desktop Publisher \n\tMagazine (Feb 1991).  Good marketing stuff with useful \n\t2-page summaries of RSI problems and solutions, with \n\treferences.\n \n    Tool: StressFree (commercial software, free usable demo)\n    Available from:\n\tLifeTime Software\n\tP.O. Box 87522\n\tHouston\n\tTexas 77287-7522, US\n\tTel: 800-947-2178 (US only)\n\tFax: +1 (713) 474-2067\n\tMail: 70412.727@compuserve.com\n\n\tDemo (working program but reduced functions) available from:\n\t    Compuserve: Windows Advanced Forum, New Uploads section, or \n\t\t\tHealth and Fitness Forum, Issues At Work section. \n\t    Anon FTP:   ftp.cica.indiana.edu (and mirroring sites)\n\n    Platforms: Windows (3.0/3.1) (Mac and DOS versions underway)\n    Description:\n\tAimed at preventing RSI, this program warns you to take\n\tbreaks after a configurable interval (or at fixed times). \n\tDisplays descriptions and pictures of exercises - pictures are\n\tanimated and program paces you to help you do exercises at the\n\tcorrect rate.  Quite a few exercises, can configure which ones\n\tare included to some extent.  Online help.\n\n\tVersion 2.0 is out soon, Mac and DOS versions will be based\n\ton this.\n\n\tCost: $29.95 if support via CompuServe or Internet, otherwise $39.95.  \n              Site license for 3 or more copies is $20.00 each.\n\t      (NOTE: prices may have gone up for V2.0).\n \n    Comments:\n\tI have had a play with this, and it works OK.  Its user interface\n\tdesign is much better in 2.0, though still a bit unusual.\n\texpensive tool around and it does the job.  It is also the only\n\ttool with a redistributable demo, so if you do get the demo, post it\n\ton your local bulletin boards, FTP servers and Bitnet servers!\n\tDoes not include general info on RSI and ergonomics, but it does \n\thave the ability to step backward in the exercise sequence,\n\twhich is good for repeating the most helpful exercises.\n\n    Tool: Typewatch (freeware), version 3.8 (October 1992)\n    Available from:\n\tEmail to richardd@hoskyns.co.uk\n\tAnonymous ftp: soda.berkeley.edu:pub/typing-injury/typewatch.shar\n    Platforms: UNIX (tested on SCO, SunOS, Mach; character and X Window mode)\n    Description:\n\tThis is a shell script that runs in the background and warns you\n\tto stop typing, based on how long you have been continuously\n\ttyping.  It does not provide exercises, but it does check\n\tthat you really do take a break, and tells you when you\n\tcan start typing again.  \n\n\tTypewatch now tells you how many minutes you have been typing\n\ttoday, each time it warns you, which is useful so you\n\tknow how much you *really* type.  It also logs information\n\tto a file that you can analyse or simply print out.  \n\n\tThe warning message appears on your screen (in character mode),\n\tin a pop-up window (for X Windows), or as a Zephyr message\n\t(for those with Athena stuff).   Tim Freeman <tsf@cs.cmu.edu> \n\thas put in a lot of bug fixes, extra features and support for \n\tX, Zephyr and Mach.\n\n\tNot formally supported, but email richardd@hoskyns.co.uk\n\t(for SCO, SunOS, character mode) or tsf@cs.cmu.edu (for Mach,\n\tX Window mode, Zephyr) if you have problems or want to give \n\tfeedback.\n\n    Tool: Various calendar / batch queue programs\n    Available from:\n\tVarious sources\n    Platforms: Various\n    Description:\n\tAny calendar/reminder program that warns you of an upcoming\n\tappointment can be turned into an ad hoc RSI management tool.\n\tOr, any batch queue submission program that lets you submit\n\ta program to run at a specific time to display a message to\n\tthe screen.\n\n\tUsing Windows as an example: create a Calendar file, and\n\tinclude this filename in your WIN.INI's 'load=' line so\n\tyou get it on every startup of Windows.  Suppose you\n\twant to have breaks every 30 minutes, starting from 9 am.\n\tPress F7 (Special Time...) to enter an appointment, enter\n\t9:30, hit Enter, and type some text in saying what the break\n\tis for.  Then press F5 to set an alarm on this entry, and repeat \n\tfor the next appointment.\n\n\tBy using Windows Recorder, you can record the keystrokes\n\tthat set up breaks throughout a day in a .REC file.  Put this\n\tfile on your 'run=' line, as above, and you will then, with\n\ta single keypress, be able to set up your daily appointments\n\twith RSI exercises.\n\n\tThe above method should be adaptable to most calendar programs. \n\tAn example using batch jobs would be to submit a simple job\n\tthat runs at 9:30 am and warns you to take a break; this will\n\tdepend a lot on your operating system.\n\n\tWhile these approaches are not ideal, they are a good way of forcing \n\tyourself to take a break if you can't get hold of a suitable RSI \n\tmanagement tool.  If you are techie enough you might want to\n\twrite a version of Typewatch (see above) for your operating\n\tsystem, using batch jobs or whatever fits best.\n\n    Tool: Digital watches with count-down timers\n    Available from:\n\tVarious sources, e.g. Casio BP-100.\n    Description:\n\tMany digital watches have timers that count down from a settable\n\tnumber of minutes; they usually reset easily to that number, either\n\tmanually or automatically.  \n\n\tWhile these are a very basic tool, they are very useful if you\n\tare writing, reading, driving, or doing anything away from\n\ta computer which can still cause or aggravate RSI.  The great\n\tadvantage is that they remind you to break from whatever you\n\tare doing.\n\t\n    Comments:\n\tMy own experience was that cutting down a lot on my typing led to\n\tmy writing a lot more, and still reading as much as ever, which\n\tactually aggravated the RSI in my right arm though the left\n\tarm improved.  Getting a count-down timer watch has been\n\tvery useful on some occasions where I write a lot in a day.\n\n\tI have tried an old fashioned hour-glass type egg timer, but\n\tthese are not much good because they do not give an audible\n\twarning of the end of the time period!\n\n\nKEYBOARD REMAPPING TOOLS: these enable you to change your keyboard mapping\nso you can type one-handedly or with a different two-handed layout.  \nOne-handed typing tools may help, but be VERY careful about how \nyou use them -- if you keep the same overall typing workload you\nare simply doubling your hand use for the hand that you use for typing,\nand may therefore make matters worse.\n\n    Tool: hsh (public domain)\n    Available from:\n\tAnonymous ftp: soda.berkeley.edu:pub/typing-injury/hsh.shar\n    Platforms: UNIX (don't know which ones)\n    Description:\n\tAllows one-handed typing and other general keyboard remappings.\n\tOnly works through tty's (so, you can use it with a terminal or\n\tan xterm, but not most X programs).\n\n    Tool: Dvorak keyboard tools (various)\n    Available from:\n\tAnonymous ftp: soda.berkeley.edu:pub/typing-injury/xdvorak.c\n\tAlso built into Windows 3.x. \n    Description:\n\tThe Dvorak keyboard apparently uses a more rational layout\n\tthat involves more balanced hand use.   It *may* help prevent\n\tRSI a bit, but you can also use it if you have RSI, since \n\tit will slow down your typing a *lot* :-)  \n","label":"sci.med"}

The scribe Matthew is perhaps\nthe most eager to draw out what he thinks are prophetic answers in\nthe career of Jesus of Nazareth.  As you will see, Matthew's main\nstrategy is to take various Old Testament passages, often not even\nabout the promised Messiah, and apply them to the circumstances in\nthe New Testament.  We must also bear in mind the question of the\nauthenticity of the accounts.  Since the gospels were written at\nleast 35 years after Jesus was executed, we do not know how much\nhappened exactly as stated.  But, for purposes of analysis, we\nwill take particular claims at face value.\n\nImmanuel:\n\n       We begin, of course, at the beginning.\n\n       (Mt 1.21-22):  \"[Mary] will bear a son, and you,\n       Joseph, will name him 'Jesus' (which means G'd is\n       salvation), for he will save his people from their\n       sins.\"  All this happened to fulfil what the lord had\n       spoken by a prophet:\n\n       [Isaiah 7.1-16]:  In the days of Ahaz (c. 750 BCE),\n       king of Judah, Rezin of Syria and Pekah of Israel made\n       war on Jerusalem (capitol of Judah), but could not\n       quite conquer it.  When the house of David (i.e. Ahaz\n       and his court in Judah) were told of this, ...its\n       heart and the heart of its people shook...   And, the\n       lord G'd said to Isaiah, \"go to meet with Ahaz...\" \n       ...And the lord spoke to Ahaz (through prophet Isaiah,\n       naturally) saying, \"Ask a sign of G'd your lord.  It\n       can be as deep as Sheol or as high as heaven.\"  But,\n       Ahaz said, \"I won't ask; I will not put the lord to a\n       test.\"  Then (Isaiah) said, \"Hear then, O house of\n       David.  Is it not enough for you to weary men, that\n       you must weary my god too?  Therefore, the lord\n       himself will give you a sign:  Behold, a young woman\n       is with child and will bear a son, and name him\n       \"Immanuel,\" which means, \"G'd is with us.\"   He will\n       eat curds and honey when he knows how to refuse evil\n       and choose good.  For, before the child knows how to\n       refuse evil and choose good, the land of the two kings\n       you dread will have been deserted...\n\nMatthew homes in on just the sentence that is in italics. \nFurther, he the Hebrew word \"almah,\" (young woman), as\nspecifically, \"virgin.\"  But, this is not a prophecy about the\nMessiah.  It is not a prophecy about an event to happen 750 years\nlater.  It is not a prophecy about a virgin (bethulah) mother.  In\nshort, it not about Jesus.  Matthew has made use of a verse out of\ncontext, and tries to make it fit the specific case of Mary.  It\nshould be noted that if we want to read the prophecy in a general\nmanner, a very general one, it can be made to fit Mary.  Mary,\nvirgin or not, was indeed a young woman with child.  Of course,\nthe fit is shady and has problems.  Jesus, while thought of by\nlater Christians to be G'd walking among men, was never called by\nthe name, Immanuel.  If Christianity wished to claim this prophecy\nfor Jesus, it becomes at best a cut-and-paste prophecy... a second\nclass prophecy.   Not too convincing.\n\nEgypt:\n\n       After Jesus's birth in Bethlehem, Matthew tells about a\nquick (and elsewhere unmentioned) excursion to Egypt, as if he\nwishes to liken Jesus to Moses.  This was done to escape an\nalleged infanticidal rampage of the king, Herod.\n\n       [Mt 2.15]  ...and remained there until the death of\n       Herod.  This was to fulfil what the lord had spoken:\n       \"Out of Egypt I have cal-led my son.\"\n\n\nWhat the lord really said was this.\n\n       [Hosea 11.1]  When Israel was a child, I loved him. \n       And, out of Egypt I called my son.  The more I called\n       them (my people), the more they went from me; they\n       kept sacrificing to the Ba'als, and kept burning\n       incense to idols.\n\nMatthew conveniently omits the rest of Hosea's oracle.  But, it\nwas indeed Israel that, once called out of Egypt, wanted to\nreturn.  This is history.  Jesus is certainly not being spoken of\nhere.  And, if we are to draw some kind of parallel here, we wind\nup with a Jesus that flees and resists G'd.   Again, this prophecy\nis just not as convincing as Matthew probably had hoped.\n\nRachel Weeps:\n\n        While Jesus is off vacationing in Egypt, Matthew says that\nKing Herod sought to kill him, and thus ordered the executions of\nall young male children.  Matthew then writes,\n\n       [Mt 2.17-18]   By this, that which was spoken by the\n       prophet Jeremiah was fulfilled:\n\n       \"A voice was heard in Ramah, wailing and loud\n       lamentation-- Rachel weeping for her children;\n       she refused to be consoled, because they were\n       no more.\"   \n\nThe reference is to a passage in Jeremiah 31.15, referring to the\ncarrying off of Israel into exile by Sargon (of Assyria) in 722\nBCE.  Rachel, the ancestor of the major tribes of Israel, Ephraim,\nand Manasseh, is said to weep for her descendants who are \"no\nmore.\"  It is metaphorical, of course, since Rachel lived and dies\nbefore the Hebrews were even in the Egyptian exile.\n       It is interesting to note that it was Leah, not Rachel, who\nwas the ancestor of the Judeans (the land where Jesus and\nBethlehem were).  If anyone should do weeping for her \"children,\"\nit is Leah.  The only connexion that Rachel has with Bethlehem is\nthat the legends have it that she was buried north of the city,\n\"on the way to Ephrath, (Bethlehem).\"\n       As for Herod and his infanticide, it is rather unlikely\nthat such an event actually occurred.  One never knows, but the\nevent is not mentioned or alluded to anywhere else in the Bible,\nnor is it mentioned in any of the secular records of the time. \nHerod was particularly unliked in his reign, and many far less\nevil deeds of Herod were carefully recorded.  This might be a\nprime example of how events were added to Jesus's life to enhance\nthe message of the church's gospel.\n       Because of the whole story's similarity to the tale of the\ninfant Moses in Egypt, it is highly likely that it is a device set\nup by Matthew to add prophetic, yet artificial, approval of Jesus.\nIt is not surprising that Matthew conveniently neglects to mention\nthe rest of the Jeremiah quote.   The \"children\" the prophet\nspeaks of are not dead, but exiled in the Assyrian Empire.  G'd\ncomforts the weeping Rachel, saying that the children will be\nreturned-- he will gather them back together.  Of course, this\nwould not suit Matthew's purpose, as the children he speaks of are\ndead for good.  Again, the \"prophecy\" Matthew sets up is not even\nthat, and to anyone who bothers to check it out, is not too\nconvincing.\n\nThe Nazarene:\n\n       We do not even have to go to the next chapter to find\nanother Matthean prophecy.  After leaving Egypt, Joseph & wife\ntake the infant Jesus to live in the city of Nazareth, \n\n       [Mt 2.23]  ...that what was spoken of by the prophets\n       might be fulfilled, \"He shall be called a Nazarene.\"\n\nFirst thing we notice is that Matthew does not mention the name of\nthe prophet(s) this time.  Second, we have to ask who \"He\" is. \nThere are no Messianic prophecies speaking of a Nazarene.  Worse,\nthere are no prophecies, period, mentioning a Nazarene.  Still\nworse, there are no Nazarenes mentioned in the Old Testament at\nall.  In the book of Judges, an angel tells Samson's mother that\nshe will,\n\n       [Judges 13.5]  \"...conceive and bear a son.  No razor\n       shall tough his head, for he will be a Nazirite to his\n       god from the day of his birth.  He will deliver Israel\n       from the hands of the Philistines.\"\n\nThis is of course not a prophecy of Jesus, or the messiah of G'd. \nBut, it is the best that can be found.  Obviously, Matthew has\nbegun to go overboard in cut-and-paste prophecies, in that he is\nsimple making them up now.\n\nBearing our\nDiseases:\n\n       Jesus next goes around healing people of physical illnesses\nand disabilities.\n\n       [Mt 8.17]   This was to fulfil what was spoken by the\n       prophet Isaiah, \"He took our infirmities and bore our\n       diseases.\"\n\nAs expected, the verse quoted in Isaiah is quoted out of context,\nand a few words are skewed to fit the Christian scheme.  We have,\n\n       [Is 53.4]  Surely he, [the suffering servant], has\n       borne our sickness, and carried our pains.\n\nFrom a reading of the surrounding passages in Isaiah, we know that\nthe prophet is speaking in present tense of the collective nation\nof Israel, Jehovah's chosen servant and people.  He speaks to the\nIsraelites suffering in exile, in the voice of the gentile nations\nthat look upon it.  This image is deeply ingrained in Jewish\nidentity --an image of a chastised, yet cherished, Israel as the\ninstrument of the nations' salvation by G'd.\n      The verses speak of Israel taking on the sicknesses which\nare the literal and metaphorical manifestations of guilt and\ndiscipline.  They do not speak of a \"servant\" going around and\nhealing people.  Notice that the servant in Isaiah takes on the\nsicknesses and pains of the nations (and individual Jews).  Jesus,\nas we all know, did not take the diseases onto himself.  The\nverses here in Isaiah are not a prophecy of something to come, but\nrather something that had already happened.  While it is believed\nthat Jesus took on the eternal punishment of hell, he did not bear\nthe illnesses he healed.  So, while someone might want to say\nthat, figuratively, Jesus reenacted the deeds of Israel in his\nspiritual atonement, he has to admit that Matthew's parallel\nmisses where he intended it to have its effect.\n\n\nSilent Messiah:\n\n      Upon healing multitudes of commoners, it is said that Jesus\nordered them to keep quiet, presumable so that he wouldn't arouse\nthe attention of the local rulers.\n\n       [Mt 12.15-21]  This was to fulfill what was spoken by\n       the prophet Isaiah.   \n\n       \"Behold my servant whom I have chosen, my beloved,\n       with whom my soul is pleased.  I will put my spirit on\n       him, and he will announce justice to the Gentiles.  He\n       will not wrangle or cry aloud, nor will anyone hear\n       his voice in the streets.  He will not break a bruised\n       reed or quench a smoldering wick until he brings\n       justice to victory, and the gentiles will hope in his\n       name.\"\n\nThe Isaiah passage quoted reads,\n\n       [Is 42.1-4]  Behold my servant whom I uphold, my\n       chosen, in whom my soul delights.  I have put my\n       spirit on him, and he will bring forth justice to the\n       nations.  We will not cry or lift up his voice, or\n       make it heard in the street.  He will not break a\n       bruised reed, or quench a smoldering wick.  He will\n       faithfully bring forth justice.  He will not fail\n       (burn dimly) or be discouraged (bruised) until he has\n       established justice in the earth.  And the coastlands\n       await his law.\n\nYou see, Matthew has conveniently left out part of the passage,\nbecause it does not suit the dealings of Jesus.  Christians could\nnever think of Jesus failing, never would the \"light\" of mankind\nburn dimly.  But, the servant nation of Israel will indeed come to\nan end when its job is done.  When the gentiles come to embrace\nG'd there will no longer be a chosen people, but rather all will\nbe the children of G'd.  Also, the ending phrase has been changed\nfrom the Judaic \"...the coastlands await his law.\" to the\nChristologic, \"the Gentiles will hope in his name.\"   While the\noriginal proclaims the Torah law of Jehovah, the other rewrites it\nto fit its strange doctrine of \"believing in the name.\"  If one\nhas any doubt the servant referred to is not Jesus, one has only\nto read the whole chapter, Isaiah 42, and hear about the beloved\nbut blind and imperfect servant, \"a people robbed and\nplundered...\"   So, we see that when Matthew's attempt at\n\"prophecy\" is examined, it crumbles.\n\nThree Days and\nThree Nights:\n\n      Now we come upon a prophecy supposedly uttered by the very\nmouth of the god Jesus himself.  He speaks of his crucifixion and\nresurrection.\n\n       [Mt 12.40]   For as Jonah was in the belly of the\n       whale for three days and three nights, so will the Son\n       of Man be in the heart of the earth three days and\n       three nights.\n\nBefore any further discussion can occur, it is necessary to know\nhow the Jews understood days.  As far as day names went, each was\n24 hours long, lasting from sunset 6pm to the following sunset\n6pm.  What was referred to as a \"day\" was the period of light from\n6am to the ending sunset at 6pm.  Thus, according to our time\nscale, a sabbath day began at 6pm Friday evening, and lasted until\n6pm saturday evening.  This is why the Jews celebrate their\nsabbath on the daylight portion of Saturdays, instead of Sundays. \n(It seems like a real miracle that Christians didn't forget that\nSaturday was indeed the seventh and last day of the week!)  Thus,\nwhen days and nights are referred to together, 12 hour daylight\nportions and 12 hour night periods are being spoken of.  Thus,\nJesus says that he will be in the grave, or in hell, or otherwise\nunresurrected for three days and three nights.\n\n      As the good book tells us, Jesus was crucified on the \"ninth\nhour,\" which is 3pm, Friday afternoon.  He then was put into the\ngrave sometime after that.  Then, Jesus left the grave, \"rose,\"\nbefore dawn of what we call Sunday (The dawn after the sabbath was\nover).  What this means is that Jesus was, using our time for\nclarity, in the grave from 6pm Friday night to some time before\n6am Sunday morning.  We could also add a little time before 6pm\nFriday, since the bible is not specific here.  What this means\nusing Jewish time is that he was in the grave for one day, two\nnights, and possibly a couple of hours of one day.  Certainly this\nis a problem for Jesus prediction.  There is absolutely no way we\nare even able to have his death involve three days and three\nnights --even using modern time measurements.   We then are led to\nsuspect that this error is another one of Matthew's little\nmistakes, and that the gospel writer put false words into his\ngod's mouth.   And no matter who made the prediction, it is more\nthan unconvincing... it is counter-convincing.\n\nHearing &\nUnderstanding:\n\n     Jesus tool on a habit of speaking to his vast audiences in\nparables-- stories in which a deeper meaning could be found, if\nyou were already one of the elect, those chosen to understand the\nmessage of Jesus.  He reasons that those who can understand the\nparables are the ones he wants.  If the people cannot understand\nthem, there is no need to bother with them, since they will not\naccept the \"plain\" message any better.  Matthew says,\n\n       [Mt 13.14-16]  With them [the audience] indeed in\n       fulfilled the prophecy of Isaiah which says, \n\n       \"You will indeed hear but never understand; and you\n       will indeed see, but never perceive.  Because this\n       people's heart has grown dull, their ears are heavy of\n       hearing, and they have shut their eyes so the they\n       would not perceive with them, her with their ears, and\n       understand with their heart, and turn for me to heal\n       them.\"\n\nThe original Isaiah passages are part of his earlier works, his\ncall to the ministry.  This is in 740 BCE, when Israel is\nflourishing, right before it falls under the authority of Assyria. \nIsaiah sees the good times ending, and also a vision from G'd,\ncalling him to bring reform to Israel and Judah.\n\n       [Is 6.9-13]  And G'd said, \"Go, and say to this\n       people, `Hear and hear, but do not understand; see and\n       see, but do not perceive.'   Make the heart of this\n       people fat, make their ears heavy, and shut their\n       eyes, so they will not see with their eyes, or hear\n       with their ears, and understand with their hearts, and\n       turn and be healed.\"  Then Isaiah said, \"How long,\n       lord?\"  And he said, \"Until the cities lie waste\n       without inhabitant, and houses without men, and the\n       land is utterly desolate, and the G'ds take men far\n       away, and forsaken places are many in the land.  And\n       though a tenth will remain in it, it will be burned\n       again, like a terebinth or an oak whose stump still\n       stands when the tree is felled.\" The holy seed is its\n       stump.\n\nHere we see that it is really G'd who causes the people of Israel\nto stop listening to the prophet's warnings, but reaffirms the\npromise made to Solomon's (and David's) seed/lineage.  If you read\nthe rest of Isaiah, you find that this is done to fulfil the plan\nof G'd to use Israel as a servant, a light to the nations.  (Look\nat Isaiah 42.18-25, 48.20, 49.3)\n     We see that Matthew has cut-and-pasted just a little portion\nof Isaiah's verse, to suit his own gospel needs.  More than that,\nhe has altered the words, to make it fit the people who didn't\nunderstand Jesus's stories.  And, as we see, Isaiah's verses are\nnot prophecies, but rather commands from G'd to him, in the\npresent.   Once again, Matthew's prophecy falls flat on its face. \n\n     Matthew tries again to make Jesus's parables look like they\nhave the prophetic approval.\n\n       [Mt 13.35]  ...he said nothing to them without a\n       parable.  This was to fulfil what was spoken of by the\n       prophet, \"I will open my mouth to them in parables.  I\n       will utter that which has been hidden since the\n       foundation of the world.\"\n\nMatthew really botches up here.  He attempts to quote not from a\nprophet, but from the Psalms.\n\n       [Ps 78.2-4]  I will open my mouth in parable.  I will\n       utter dark sayings of old, things that we all have\n       heard and known, things that our fathers have told us. \n       We will not hide them from their children, but tell to\n       the coming generation the glorious deeds of the\n       lord...\n\nAs was pointed out, the verses in the Psalms do not really come\nfrom a prophet.  You might also want to know that earlier copies\nof Matthew's gospel even inserted Isaiah's name as this prophet. \nApparently, later scribes caught the error and tried to cover some\nof it up.\n     Perhaps the most significant part of this is that, once\nagain, Matthew has altered the Old Testament Scriptures.  As Jesus\nhas said earlier, he speaks in parables so that some will not\nunderstand them.  The parables in the Psalms are not to be hidden. \nFurther, they speak of things \"known, that our fathers have told\nus.\"  Jesus deals with things \"hidden since the foundation of the\nworld.\"  Indeed Jesus dealt in a lot of secrecy and confusion. \nThis is in direct opposition to the parables in the Psalms.  No\nwonder Matthew had to rewrite them!   And still once again,\nMatthew's artificial prophecies fall flat on their face.  But,\nChristians rarely look at this.  Matthew's prophecies aren't the\nonly things about Christianity that are beginning to look bad.\n\n\nExcuses of\nLittle Faith:\n\n       In Mt. 17.14-21, we see that the disciples are able to go\naround casting out demons, except in one case.  Not knowing what\nepilepsy was, the people thought those with the disease were\npossesed with demons.  It is no wonder that the disciples were\nunable to \"dispossess\" the epileptic.  But, Jesus, perhaps no more\nenlightened than they, is reported to have rebuked them, saying\nthey didn't have enough faith.   This seems strange.  Why was this\ndemon special?  It seems that either a true believer has faith or\nhe does not.  Apparently, enough faith will allow someone to move\nmountains.  Of course, you will find no one, these days that can\nmove real mountains.  No one parts seas.  The only miracles the\nCharismatics can speak of are those rumoured to happen on trips to\nMexico or some faraway place.  Major miracles are making some old\nwoman's arthritis feel better on Sunday morning T.V.\n\n       And the gods, including Jesus, are always shrouded in\nancient lore and writings, protected from the skeptics in their\nsacred pasts.  They are either dead, sleeping, or hiding in\nheaven, with people rumouring about their imminent return and\ntheir great miracles of days long gone.  Yet, life goes on.  \n\n     Tales of mystics, stories of miracles-- all in a distant time\nor a distant place.  Gods used to reveal themselves to men in the\nold days, Jehovah too.  But, now they are silent.  All the\ntheologians give are various excuses as to why we don't get to see\nGod anymore.\n\n       We're too lazy; we're not zealous enough; we're\n       sinful; it's just his \"plan\"; we put too many of our\n       own demands on G'd's appearance; if we had the right\n       faith, if we  were willing to meet G'd on his terms...\n\n     Yet, even the most pious of men have not seen G'd.  You, dear\nreader, have not seen G'd.  Not literally, you know that to be\ntrue. (I know that's presumptuous and bold.  But, searching your\nheart, you know what I mean.)  All that we've seen religions do is\nmake people feel good and content about not seeing G'd.  They say\nour little faith does not merit us to see G'd.  Sometimes, they\nsay, \"See the love in these people you worship with... see the\nlives of people change... that is seeing G'd.\"   Thus people get\nlulled to sleep, satisfied with turning G'd into the everyday\nsights.   But, that is not seeing G'd as I am speaking of... it is\nnot seeing G'd the way people used to see.  \n      What we see in the world that is good, is the compassion of\nhuman hearts, the love given and taken by men and women, the\nforgiveness practised by Christian & Atheist alike, beauty created\nby the mind of man.  These are the things that are done; these are\nwhat we see.  But, it is said this is so only because everybody\nhas little faith.\n\f\nJesus Rides on\nan Ass:\n\n       Shortly after accepting the role of the Jewish messiah\nking, Jesus requests a donkey be brought in for him to ride into\nJerusalem.  \n\n       [Mt 21.5]  This took place to fulfil what was spoken\n       by the prophet, saying,\n\n       Tell the daughter of Zion, \"Behold, your king is\n       coming to you, humble, mounted on an ass, and on a\n       ass-colt.\"\n\nOf course, the passage quoted from Zechariah 9.9 reads a little\ndifferently.\n\n       Lo, your king comes to you; he is triumphant and\n       victorious, humble, and riding on an ass, on an ass-\n       colt... he will command peace to the nations.\n\nThere isn't all that much difference here, except that Zechariah\nonly involves one animal  --an ass-colt--  while Matthew reads the\npoetic wording slightly differently.  Thus, he has Jesus call for\nboth a colt and an adult ass.  From Matthew's version, we get a\ncomical picture of the divine Christ sweating it to straddle two\ndonkeys.  This could inevitably lead to a theological,\nproctological dilemma!   We find that in the account written\nearlier by St. Mark, only the colt was called for and brought to\nJesus.  This indeed fits the verses of Zechariah properly, and\nshows us that in Matthew attempt to use prophetic verses, he has\nbungled.  Now, excluding many respectable Christians I have met, I\nhave noticed that while Christ is thought to have ridden on asses,\nthe situation is often reversed nowadays...\n\n       Then, entering the Jerusalem temple, the priests were\nangered at people and youngsters calling Jesus the messiah.  But,\nJesus replied as we might expect Matthew to have done,\n\n       [Mt 21.16]  Haven't you read?  `Out of the mouth of\n       babes and sucklings thou has brought perfect praise.'\n\nIt is more likely that Matthew made this response up since Jesus\nwas never one to point out such little \"prophetic\" things AND\nsince, as we might expect, the quote is in error, which seems to\nfit Matthew's track record quite well.  We might ask Jesus or\nMatthew, \"Haven't you read?\" for the source reads,\n\n       [Psalms 8.1-2]  O YaHWeH our lord, how majestic is\n       your name in the whole world!   You, whose glory is\n       chanted above the heavens by babes and infants, you\n       have founded a bulwark against your foes to still the\n       enemy and the avenger.\n\nThe passages hardly need comment.  There is no \"perfect praise\"\nspoken of in the psalm, and what praise is there is given to G'd,\nnot his messiah king, and not Jesus.  As mentioned, it seems to be\njust one more case of Matthew's pen making up convenient prophetic\nscripture.\n\nYHVH said to \nmy lord...:\n\n      Jesus is said to have asked from whom the promised Jewish\nmessiah-king is to be descended.  The Jews agree-- it is king\nDavid.  But, then Jesus counters by quoting Psalms 110,\n\n       \"The LORD said to my Lord, sit at my right hand, until\n       I put your enemies under your feet.\"\n\nTaken at face value, Jesus is denying the necessity of Davidic\ndescent.  One assumes he is in opposition to their answer.  Of\ncourse, the Christian answer is that he agrees, but is trying to\nmake some hidden point, to reveal some mystery about the divine\nnature of the messiah-king.  It's tempting to believe this, if one\nis a Christian and not interested in matters of investigation. \nBut, there are problems.\n       In Jesus's time, the psalm was thought to be about the\nmessiah.  And, it is easy to see why David might refer to the\nmessiah as his superior.  We need only look at the scriptures\nabout the messiah to see that he is expected to be a great king,\nbringing the Jews to times even better than those under David's\nrule.  Of course, the Jews listening had no good answer, and the\npassage could indeed refer to a divine messiah, such as the\nChristians worship.  The problem lies in the meaning of this\npsalm, an error that apparently several Jews of Jesus's time had\nalso made.  One must remember that there were various factions\namong the Jews, often as a result of different expectations of the\nmessiah-king.  Jesus was apparently one of these adventists, like\nhis audience, who thought the messiah's advent was imminent, and\nwho interpreted Psalms 110, among others, as being messianic.\nWhat is the problem, then?  Psalm 110 literally reads,\n\n       YHVH's utterance to my lord:\n\t\"Sit at my right hand, until I make your enemies your\n       footstool.\"\n\n       YHVH sends forth your mighty scepter from Zion.  Rule\n       in the midst of your foes!  Your people will offer\n       themselves freely on the day you lead your host on the\n       holy mountains.  \n\n       \"You are a priest of the order of Melchizedek\n       forever.\"\n\nThe word \"lord\" is often mistakenly capitalised by Christian\nbibles to denote divinity in this lord.  But, in the Hebrew, the\nword is \"adoni,\" and no capitalisation exists.  Adoni simply means\n\"lord,\" a generic term as we would use it.  It is used often in\nthe scriptures to refer to kings and to G'd.  It is merely an\naddress of respect.  \n      There is nothing in the text itself to imply that the word\nrefers either to divinity or to the messiah-king.  That this is\nsupposed to be written by David is not certain.  The title of the\npsalm translates to either \"a psalm of David,\" or \"a psalm about\nDavid.\"  It seems fitting to assume it to be written by a court\npoet, about David's covenant and endorsement from G'd.  If the\npsalm had been written by David, it is unlikely that he would be\ntalking about the messiah.  The idea of a perfect king, descended\nfrom David, was not present in David's age.  We have extensive\ntales of David's doings and sayings-- none of which include any\npraises of a messiah.\n     Many of the psalms show evidence of being written long after\nDavid was dead, in times of the exile when G'd had put his show of\nfavour for David's kingdom on hold.  \n     The description in the psalm fit David very well.  David was\npromised by G'd a rise to power, victory over his enemies,\nsuccessful judgement among the nations he conquered.  He achieved\nthe priesthood common to Melchizedek in being a righteous king,\nenabled to bless the people.   It all fits.\n      We do not have to blame this problem on Matthew alone,\nthough.  Here, there is not artificial prophecy alluded to, though\nhis use of the scripture is rather questionable.  Still, this\nevent is common to the other gospels too.  So, we let Matthew off\na little more easily this time.  It is interesting to note,\nthough, how Matthew dresses up the event.  The earlier gospel of\nMark tells the tale with Jesus simply speaking to a crowd. \nMatthew has the Pharisees, who became the religious competition of\nan infant Christianity, be the target of Jesus's question.  As we\nmight expect, Matthew writes that the event ends up by\nembarrassing the Pharisees.  Such power is the pen.\n\nMoses & Jesus,\nHad it Together\nAll Along...:\n\n       We leave the gospel story of Matthew momentarily to see a\npseudo-prophecy in John's gospel.  The gospel story of John\ndeserves special treatment, because it seems to be so far removed\nfrom the real events of Jesus's career as told by even Matthew. \nBut, for the moment, we will just look at one verse.  The early\nchurch leaders founded a religion on the Jewish hopes of a messiah\nking, and on an artificial extension of the original promises made\nby G'd.  When constructing the history of Abraham, Moses wrote of\na promise of land and nationhood to the Jewish people.  While this\nwas accomplished eventually, under the rule of king David, the\nChristians who came along later decided that they would claim the\nfulfillment of the promise.  But, to do so, they expanded on the\npromise, preaching about a heavenly kingdom.\n\n       [John 8.56] (J.C. speaking) Your father, Abraham,\n       rejoiced to see My day.  He say it and was glad.\n\nIt would be nice to tie in approval for Jesus from Abraham, but,\nAbraham knew nothing of Jesus or a messiah, or anything Christian. \nI have tried, and failed to find any event in the Old Testament\nwhich corresponds to John's little prophecy.  It is par for the\ncourse to see St. John making up Old Testament backings, just like\nhis forerunner Matthew.  Many Christians know that their faith has\nmany of its foundations in such fraud, and it is surprising they\nstill cling to it.\n\nThe Potter's\nField:\n\n      We are told that Jesus was betrayed while in Jerusalem by\none of his followers, Judas Iscariot.   Matthew writes,\n\n       [Mt 27.5-10]  And throwing down the pieces of silver\n       in the temple, [Judas] departed... But, the chief\n       priests, taking the silver, said, \"It isn't lawful for\n       us to put it in the treasury, since it is blood\n       money.\"  So they... bought a potter's field with it to\n       bury strangers in... Then was fulfilled what was\n       spoken by the prophet Jeremiah,\n\n       \"And they took the thirty pieces of silver, the price\n       of him on whom a price had been set by some of the\n       sons of Israel, and they gave them for the potter's\n       field, as the lord directed me.\"\n\nThis prophecy is an utterly gross bastardisation of Old Testament\nScripture.  First, Matthew has made a mistake regarding the name\nof the prophet.  It is Zechariah who utters the verses which\nMatthew makes use of.\n\n       [Zech. 11.12-13]  ...And they weighed out my wages,\n       thirty shekels of silver.  Then YHVH said to me, \"Cast\n       them to the treasury,\" --the lordly price at which I\n       was paid off by them.  So I took the thirty shekels of\n       silver and cast them into the treasury in the house of\n       YHVH.\n\nFirst of all, the verses of Zechariah do not deal with a betrayer\nof the messiah, or of G'd.  The deal with a shepherd, most likely\na priest, chosen to serve a function of presiding over the people\nshortly before G'd would send Judah and Israel into conflict with\none another.  The word, \"treasury,\" had been replaced by the King\nJames Scholars with \"to the potter,\" precisely because this made\nMatthew's quote fit better.  But, this is a blatant error.  The\ncorrect translation of the Hebrew is indeed \"treasury,\" which also\nmakes perfect sense in Zechariah's context, whereas \"potter's\nfield\" is totally unrelated.  Whether the mistranslation was\nintentional or not seems to be beyond speculation.  However, given\nMatthew's track record, one finds it hard to resist the notion of\nintentional dishonesty.\n      Of course, Matthew would have ample reason for altering the\ntext.  The thirty pieces of silver match Judas's situation, and if\nas most Christians seem to be, the reader is willing to disregard\nthe contextual incongruity, Matthew might have another prophecy to\ntoss around.  However, the correct translation of Zechariah\ndirectly contradicts the situation with Judas and the high\npriests.  The high priests would not put the money in the\ntreasury.  The worthless shepherd of Zechariah does exactly the\nopposite!  Of course, to the average Thursday-Night Bible student,\nthe \"prophecy\" as presented by Matthew would be taken at New\nTestament face value.  To those, Matthew's work is convincing\nenough.\n\nWine, Vinegar,\n& Casting Lots:\n\n      Then, Jesus is led away to be crucified.\n\n       [Mt 27.34-35]  ...they gave him vinegar to drink,\n       mingled with gall; but when he tasted it, he would not\n       drink it.  And, when they had crucified him, they\n       divided his garments among them by casting lots: that\n       it might be fulfilled what was spoken by the prophet,\n\n       \"They parted my garments among them, and upon my\n       vesture did they cast lots.\"\n\nFirst of all, the vinegar offered to Jesus is actually common sour\nwine, of the type that Roman soldiers drank regularly.  We find\nthat right before Jesus dies, the soldiers themselves give him\nsome to drink --not polluted with gall.\n\n       [Jn 19.28-30]  Jesus... said, \"I thirst.\"  A bowl of\n       vinegar stood there, so they put a sponge full of the\n       vinegar on hyssop and held it to his mouth.  When he\n       had received the vinegar, he said, \"It is finished;\"\n\nBut, Matthew seems to be drawing on, not a passage from the\nprophets, but one from the Psalms.\n\n       [Ps 69.20-28]  I looked for pity, but there was none;\n       and for comforters, but I found none.  They gave me\n       poison for food (lit. they put gall in my meat), and\n       for my thirst, they gave me vinegar to drink...  Add\n       to them punishment upon punishment, may they have no\n       acquittal from thee.  Let them be blotted out of the\n       Book of the Living.\n\nOf course, the sour wine offered to Jesus is done at his request\nof drink.  This does indeed seem to be a show of pity.  The psalm\nquoted is about David and his political and military enemies.  It\nis not about the messiah or Jesus.  It is then not surprising that\nwe run into further problem when we see that the \"Jesus\" in the\npsalm asks G'd for the damnation of the \"crucifiers,\" whereas the\nJesus of the gospels says,\n\n       [Lk 23.34]  Jesus said, \"Father, forgive them, the\n       don't know what they do!\"\n\nFurther, Matthew misses with his attempt to create prophecy by\nhaving gall (a bitter substance) put into Jesus's drink, not his\nmeat, as the psalm stipulates.\n\n       With the \"prophecy\" of the vinegar faulty, we naturally\nask, \"What of the casting of lots?\"  This brings up the 22nd\nPsalm, which deserves discussion all by itself.  Suffice it now to\nsay that the fact that Jesus's clothes were divided as told is no\ngreat thing.  It turns out that this happened often to any felon\nin those days.  As we will soon see, it is perhaps the least\nerroneous passage of the psalm when applied to Jesus.  It does\nindeed bring up the interesting question as to the quality of\nJesus's clothes.  For a man so removed from worldly possessions,\nhis ownership of clothes worthy of casting lots raises some\nsuspicions.\n\nThe 22nd Psalm:\n\n      This psalm is attributed to David, as a lament of his\ncondition under the attack of his enemies.  It becomes a song of\npraise to YHVH and of hope.  Taken out of context, parts of it\nseem to fit the plight of Jesus at the crucifixion quite well.  We\nwill examine the primary passages.\n\n       Verse 1-2:  My god, my god! why have you forsaken me?! \n       Why are you so far from helping me, far from the words\n       of my groaning?  Oh, my god, I cry by day, but you\n       don't answer, and by night, but find no rest.\n\nJesus is said to have cried the first sentence while on the cross. \nThis suggests that the whole psalm is really about Jesus, rather\nthan king David.  Of course, the rest of the first stanza does not\nfit as nicely to Jesus or his execution.  Jesus is not pictured as\ncomplaining about the whole ordeal, he is supposed to be like \"the\nlamb led mute before its shearers.\"  Indeed, Jesus doesn't do much\ngroaning, even when on the cross.  He certainly does not cry by\nboth day and night on the cross.\n\n       6-8:  But, I am a worm, and no man-- scorned by men... \n       All who see me mock at me.  They make faces and wag\n       their heads;  \"He committed his cause to YHVH.  So let\n       him deliver him... for he delights in him.\"\n\nThis seems to fit Jesus's execution pretty well, with the\nexception of the Holy messiah being called a worm.\n\n       12-13:  Many bulls encompass me... they open their\n       mouths widely at me like a ravening and roaring lion.\n\n       16-18:  Yea, dogs are round about me, a company of\n       evildoers encir-cle me, they have pierced my hands and\n       feet.  I can see all my bones... They divide my\n       garments among them, and cast lost for my raiment.\n\n       19-21:  But you, YHVH, be not far away!  ...Deliver my\n       soul from the sword, my life from the power of the\n       dog!  Save me from the mouth of the lion, and my\n       afflicted soul from the horns of the wild bull!\n\nIt would seem quite convincing, and I'm sure the early Christian\nfathers who wrote of this prophecy thought so too.  Unfortunately,\nthis prophecy has a fatal flaw.  The words \"have pierced\" really\ndo not exist in the psalm.  The correct Hebrew translation is,\n\n       16:  Yea, dogs are round about me, a company of\n       evildoers encircles me, like the lion, they are at my\n       hands and feet...\n\nIn Hebrew the phrase \"like the lion\" and a very rare verb form\nwhich can mean \"pierced\" differ by one phonetic character.  The\nword in the Hebrew text is literally, \"like the lion\" (ka'ari),\nwhich makes sense in the context, and even further fits the animal\nimagery employed by the psalm writer.  It is convenience that\nwould urge a Christian to change the word to \"ka'aru.\"   But, to\nadd the needed (yet artificial) weight to the \"prophecy\" this is\njust what the Christian translators have chosen to do.  While the\ncorrect translation does not eliminate the psalm from referring to\nJesus, its absence does not say much for the honesty of the\ntranslators.\n\n       Apart from the erroneous verse 16, the psalm does not lend\nitself to Jesus so easily.  Verse 20 speaks of the sufferer being\nsaved from a sword rather than a cross.  This naturally fits the\npsalm's true subject, king David.  As a side note, we now know\nthat crucifixions did not pierce the hands, the palms, but rather\nthe forearms.  This doesn't say much in favour of the traditional\nthought of a resurrected Jesus showing his disciples the scars on\nhis palms.  But then, facts aren't bound by our religious beliefs.\n\n      Matthew escapes culpability this time, as he does not\nattempt to draw many direct links between this psalm and his lord\nJesus.  But the psalm, like many others, was on the minds of all\nthe gospel writers when they compiled the stories and\ninterpretations of Jesus's life and death.  How much these\nscriptures may have contributed to what actually got written down\nis a question that has serious repercussions for Christian\ntheology.  It is easy to see, for those who are not faithful\nfundamentalists, how some of the events in the New Testament might\nhave been \"enhanced\" by scribes such as the eager Matthew.  But,\nit does less to speculate than to simply investigate scriptural\nmatters and prophetic claims.  So far, this has not said good\nthings for St. Matthew.\n\nThe reference to the piercing looks a lot like Jesus's\ncrucifixion.  John's gospel recount, written about 70 years after\nthe fact, tells us at Jesus's execution,\n\n       [Jn 19.34,37]  But one of the soldiers pierced his\n       side with a spear, and out came blood and water...\n       these things took place that Scripture be fulfilled...\n       \"The will look on him whom they've pierced.\"\n\nOf course, this is built on a passage taken blatantly out of\ncontext.   Prophet Zechariah tells us how much of the nation of\nIsrael will split off from Jerusalem and Judah and go to war with\nthem.\n\n       [Zc 12.7-10]  And YHVH will give victory to Judah...\n       And on that day, I will seek to destroy the nations\n       that come against Jerusalem (in Judah).  And I will\n       pour a spirit of compassion and supplication... on\n       Jerusalem so that when they look on him who they have\n       pierced, they will mourn, and weep bitterly over him\n       like you weep over a firstborn child.\n\nJohn's attempt to make up prophecy is perhaps weaker that\nMatthew's attempts.  Matthew, at least, usually excontexts more\nthan just one passage.  John's errors are grossly obvious and\nblatant here.  It does not speak well for any of the gospel\nwriters, as it helps to show how the prophetic aspects of their\nreligion were founded.\n\n\f\nReckoned with\nTransgressors:\n\n       After his arrest, Jesus is quickly executed for claiming\nthe Jewish kingship, messiahship.   According to one version of\nthe gospel tale, Jesus gets executed along with two thieves.\n\n       [Mk 15.27]  And with him they crucified two robbers,\n       one on his right, one on his left.  And so the\n       scripture was fulfilled which says,\n\n       \"He was reckoned with the transgressors.\"\n\nHere, Mark is trying to link Jesus to a passage in Isaiah 53,\nabout the servant nation of Israel.  The passage is not about the\nmessiah, for if one reads the whole chapter of Isaiah 53, and its\nsurrounding chapters, one sees that the servant is a nation.  The\nverses are also about what this servant has gone through in the\npast, not a prediction of what is to come, in any event.  The\nservant is thought of as a criminal.  This also happens to fit the\ndescription of Jesus.  Had the passage really been about the\nmessiah, it still is not at all clear why executing Jesus between\ntwo thieves would fulfill the \"prophecy\" in Isaiah.  Jesus would\nmore fittingly fulfill it with his whole ministry.  He was\nconsidered a blasphemer and troublemaker all throughout his\ncareer.   Locking onto a single event is a rather poor way to\nsteal prophecy, at least in this case, as we see that Mark could\nhave had made a better analogy with general comparisons.\n\n       Mark goes on to tell us how \"those who were crucified with\n[Jesus] also reviled him.\" [15.32]  This is to be expected from a\ncouple of robbers.  Of course in his later recount, St. Luke\ndecides to change some things.  Luke tells us,\n\n       [Lk 23.39-43]  And one of the criminals who was hanged\n       with him railed, \"Aren't you the messiah?! Save\n       yourself, and us!\"\n\nThis certainly fits with Mark's recount, which tells how the\npeople who crucified Jesus said, \"Save yourself!\" and that the\nrobbers did the same.  But then Luke goes on,\n\n       But the other [criminal] rebuked [the first] saying,\n       \"Don't you fear G'd, since you are under the same\n       sentence of condemnation?  And we, indeed justly so,\n       for we are receiving the due reward for our deeds. \n       But, this man has done nothing wrong. And he said,\n       \"Jesus, remember me when you come in your kingdom.\" \n       And Jesus answered, \"Verily I say to you, today you\n       will be with me in paradise.\"\n\nNow, this little dialogue seems highly contrived.  It stretches\nthe imagination a bit to see this picture of one ruffian rebuking\nhis fellow criminal with such eloquent speech.  We have a rather\nstrange picture of a criminal lamenting over the goodness of his\npunishment and the justness of his suffering.   Such a man,\napparently noble and of principle, doesn't seem likely to have\nbeen a robber.  We wonder at the amount of theatrics created by\nLuke.  Of course, Luke's recount also disagrees with Mark's.  \nLuke has only one criminal revile Jesus, not both.  It is easy\nenough to discount the discrepancy because the account was made\nup, but those who wish to believe it is all part of the error free\nwords of G'd do not have this avenue open.  This is yet another\nexample of a writer trying to take an Old Testament passage and\nexpand it and reinterpret it to suit his theology.  In this case,\nthe embroidery creates some embarrassing problems, as we have\nseen.\n\nThe End of the\nWorld--\n       Mt. 24:\n\n       Now comes perhaps one of the most extraordinary and\nembarrassing passages in the New Testament.  It is found in all\nthree of the synoptic gospel stories, and casts some of the most\nunfavourable doubt on the whole theory of Christianity.  Jesus\nmentions the destruction of the Jewish temples and buildings, and\nhis disciples ask him about this, and about the end of the world\nwhich he has been warning about.\n\n       The disciples: Tell us, when will this [the temple's\n       destruction] be, and what will be the sign of your\n       coming, and of the close of the age?\n\n       Jesus: Take care that no one leads you astray, for\n       many will come in my name, saying, \"I am the christ.\"  \n       ...you will hear of wars and rumours of wars... for\n       this must take place, but the end is not yet.   For,\n       nation will rise against nation... all this is but the\n       beginning of the birthpangs.\n             They will deliver you up... put you to death,\n       and false prophets will arise and lead many astray.\n       ...But he who endures to the end will be saved.  This\n       gospel will be preached throughout the whole world, a\n       testimony to the nations, and then the end will come.\n             So, when you see the desolation spoken of by the\n       prophet Daniel, ...let those who are in Judea flee to\n       the mountains.\n\n             Immediately after the tribulation of those days,\n       the sun will be darkened... the stars will fall from\n       heaven... then will appear the sign of the Son of Man\n       in heaven, and all the tribes of the earth will mourn,\n       and see the Son of Man coming... and he will send out\n       his angels... and gather his elect...\n             Learn the lesson of the fig tree: as soon as its\n       branch becomes tender and puts forth leaves, you know\n       that summer is near.  So also, when you see all these\n       things, you will know that He is near, at the very\n       gate.  Truly I say to you, this generation will not\n       pass away until all these things take place...\n             But, of the day and hour, no one knows; not the\n       angels, not the Son, but only the Father... Therefore,\n       you also must be ready, for the Son of Man is coming\n       at an hour you do not expect.\n\nFrom this, it is clear that Jesus thought the world would in\nwithin the lifetimes of at least some of his disciples.  He tells\nthem that although he doesn't know the exact day or hour, that it\nwill come, and thus they must be ready.  Theologians have wet\ntheir pants in panic to find some way out of this Holy Error. \nBut, unfortunately, Jesus made himself to explicit.  He told his\ndisciples that their generation would still be around at the End,\nand that they in particular should prepare for it, prepare to be\nswept away.\n      There have been some who resorted to removing the inerrant\nnature of the Bible, and said that the phrase, \"this generation\nshall not pass away...\" really means \"this race of people will not\npass away...\"  Of course, the word for generation is used many\ntimes to refer to exactly that, the generation of the disciples. \nIt is an interesting notion that when God decided to learn Greek,\nhe didn't learn it well enough to make himself clear.  But. it is\nquite obvious from the rest of the dialogue that the disciples (at\nleast some of them) are supposed to live to the End of the World. \nThe charge of mistranslation is completely blown away by looking\nat the Apostles' responses.  It becomes abundantly clear from\nRev. 22.7, 1 Peter 4.7, 1 John 2.18, and Rev. 22.20, that Jesus\nmeant exactly what he said.  The End was very near.\n\n       For 2,000 years, Christians have rationalised this 24th\nchapter of Matthew, or ignored its meaning altogether.  For 2,000\nyears, they have waited for their executed leader to come back,\nhearing of wars, and rumours of wars, sure that He is coming soon. \nSurely He must be.  All we must do is wait.  Can you imagine how\ntired He must be, sitting around up there, being holy, waiting for\njust the right moment to spring?\n\n\n       So, shortly after his crucifixion, Jesus of Nazareth,\n(Joshua-ben-Joseph), died.   It is said that after three days, or\nthree days and three nights, or three periods of time, or three\neternal seconds --or three of whatever they can decide makes for\nless trouble-- he was seen again, resurrected, glowing with divine\nradiance.  Then the Saviour decided it wasn't in the best\ninterests of his new religion to stick around, and therefore\ndisappeared from sight into heaven.  So the story goes, anyway. \nAs has been seen, there were many things attributed to Jesus when\npeople got around to writing the gospel stories down.  To them,\nJesus was the fulfiller of all prophecy and scripture.  We have\nseen, though, that this matter is quite shaky.  But, throughout\nChurch history, Christians have held fast to faith, in simple\nbelief.  What doctrinal objections could not be solved with\nargumentation or brute force, faith and forgetfulness kept away\nfrom question.  To question and investigate has never been the\neasiest way to treat matters.  Thus for 2,000 years, the\nprophecies cited in the New Testament have gone on largely\naccepted.  Things may well continue that way for some time. \nPausing a moment to consider the way the doctrines of Christianity\nhave been accepted and used (properly or improperly) to support\nwars and persecution, I suppose there is one prophecy of which\nChristianity can securely keep hold.","label":"alt.atheism"}

You also have to \nconsider the negative side: Law abiding citizens, armed with \nfireamrs (pistols for the most part), prevent between 80,000\n(National Crime Survey) and 1,000,000 (Dr. Kleck) crimes\neach year. (Those are the extremes. Most studies find\nthe number to be 500,000 to 600,000.) About 1% of those crimes are\nhomicides, so private ownership of firearms _saves_ approximately\n5,000 lives each year. There are roughly 12,000 criminal homicides\nand fatal accidents involving guns each year. For there to \nbe any net benefit, you would have to show that gun control measures\nwould disarm over 40% of the criminals currently using guns.\nThat would be very hard to do: According the the federal BATF,\nonly 8% of criminals buy their guns over the counter. Since\ngun control laws, by their very nature, only effect legal\nsales, such a law would remove all the benefits of armed,\nlaw-abiding citizens while having only a minimal effect on\narmed criminals (who, by and large, get their guns illegally.) \nThat doesn't sound like a net benefit to me.\n  \n\nSince most were with licensed weapons, I assume you are not\nsupporting \"reasonable\" laws (i.e. waiting periods, background\nchecks, licenses, etc...). Since only a complete ban would \nalter the statistic you refer to, I assume that's what you\nare supporting.\n\nBy the way, 1135 people dies in 1986 from falling down stairs.\n250 accidental handgun deaths isn't significant next to \nother household accidents.\n\n\n1080 children under the age of 10 died by drowning, 69 from \ndrinking poisonous household chemicals (like Drano), 139 from\nfalls. If the real goal is to reduce the tragic, accidental\ndeaths of children, wouldn't a ban on drain cleaners be a \nbetter palce to start? (Or, perhaps, restricting ownership to\nprofessionals like plumbers?)\n\n\nWhile you might call it \"emphasis\", refering to completely two\nstatistics in the same sentence _implies_ a comparison. If it\nisn't valid, and you put the numbers together to convince people\nyou are right, the kindest thing I could call it is propaganda.","label":"talk.politics.guns"}

It could mean that, or it could mean that he just hit\na lot better at home than he did on the road (see Frank Thomas' home/road\nsplits in '91 for an example).  I would guess that some of Alomar's split\nis due to the Skydome, but most of it is probably due just to coincidence.\nThere's no way to be sure, of course, but the only hitters the Skydome\nseems to regularly help a lot are right handed home run hitters, and\nAlomar is not a home run hitter.\n\n\nOnly because of t&P's bogus fielding stats, which rate Alomar as the worst\ndefensive second baseman in the league.  On a career basis, I think T&P's\nfielding stats may mean something, but on a seasonal basis it comes up\nwith ridiculous results like this.  Alomar may not be the god of fielding\nthe media says he is, but he sure isn't the worst in baseball.\n\nOffensively, T&P rate Alomar much higher last year.\n\nRegarding the A vs. B argument, I'll just say they're both very good players\nwith different strengths and a bright future.\n","label":"rec.sport.baseball"}

{"text":"Classify the following data: Sorry for posting this, but my e-mail keeps bouncing.  Maybe it will\nhelp others here, anyway, and therefore I pray others will read this.  It is\nactually a response from my Aunt, who has 5 kids, since I have none yet.\n\n     I'm posting this for a good Christian relative who does not have e-mail\naccess.  Since this aunt and uncle have 5 kids I felt they would be more\nrelevant than I, who have none (yet).\n\n     13-year-old (13YO) twins, 10YO boy, 6.5YO boy, 2YO girl\n\n     I don't call it spanking, but they do, so yes, very rarely.\n\n     I don't call it spanking because it's more of a reaction to something\nvery dangerous, such as trying to stick their finger in a fan or running\ninto the road.  Maybe 3-4 times for each except for the 2YO girl, who has\nnot been spanked yet.\n     They call it that because it *does* hurt their feelings, and of course\nI give all the hugs and stuff to ensure they know they're still loved.\n\n     No, that would be too painful.  If it's too traumatic they never recall\nwhy they were punished.  Besides, it must be immediate, and taking the time\nto go get a toolmeans you're not doing it right away, and that lessens the\nimpact.  It's very emotional for a child as it is - which is evidenced by the\nfact that a little slap on the rear - which hurts for perhaps 5 seconds -\nis called a spanking.\n     Lots of logical consequences - for instance, when 4YO Matthew dared\na good friend to jump out of his treehouse or he would push him out, I made\nsure they didn't play together for 5 days so he'd know that would make him\nlose friends very quickly.  He's never done anything like that since.\n     We also use time-out in their rooms - I use a timer so they don't keep\narguing with me over leaving, since it's hard to argue with a macine.\nI will go to the closed door and tell them timeout won't be over until they\ncalm down if they're too tantrumy.  I use the top of the stairs when they're\nreally young.\n\n     40\n\n     Bath, Ohio.  It's right outside of Akron, in the northeast part of Ohio.\n\n     No, and none of my kids would dream of it.  I hope you can use this to\nteach all parents that physical punishment isn't always required - parents use\nthat as an excuse to hit too hard.\n\n     Lots of timeouts, same as I use.  Our family and my husband's have never\nused spankings.  In fact, my grandmother in law was one of 11 kids, and they\nwere almost never spanked.  This was around the turn of the century.  And,\nnone of us has ever been afoul of the law - man-made or God's law.\n     Jesus says, referring to a small child whom he is holding, that \"what\nye do to the least of these, ye do also to me.\"  The Bible also says in all\nthings to be kind, and merciful, and especially loving. (Colossians 3:12-15.)\nThere is no room for selfish anger, which I'll admit I've been tempted with\nat times.  When I've felt like spanking hard in anger, maybe the kid deserved\na little slap on the rear, but what I would have given would have been the\ndevil's work.  I could feel the temptation, and just angrily ordered the kid\nto his/her room and went to my room myself.  After praying and asking God's\nforgiveness, I was much calmer, and did not feel like spanking, but felt that\nwhat I had done was enough punishment.","label":"soc.religion.christian"}

He pitched well for several more years.  Carlton\nwon 13 and lost 20 the year after his 27-10 record. (Source: Bill James\nHistorical Baseball Abstract.)\n     And let's not forget John Tudor, who started 1-5 and finished 21-6 in\n1985.  He had a pretty bad ERA when you take Busch Stadium into account at\nthe start of the season.\n\n\n     If I recall, he had a 4.50 ERA in the 1st half and a 3.50 ERA in the\n2nd half of last year.  \n     Hmmm, 21 runs in 11 innings.  Suppose he starts 30 more games, and winds\nup w/200 innings pitched.  If he allows 4 runs a game in the next 189\ninnings, he'll have a 4.75 ERA or so at the end of the year. (I think I have\nhis totals right.) This is going to be hard to come back from.\n\n\n     My 1st hunch is that Morris is very gutsy, and that he may be pitching\nthrough an injury and not telling anyone.  My 2nd guess is that he will be\nbanished to the bullpen the remainder of the season after a few more starts.\n(Perhaps when Stewart comes off the DL?  Or will Danny Cox, who went 3 or 4\nscoreless innings against the Tribe today, start for Morris?  He looks like\na really good one.

{"text":"Classify the following data: \n\n\n\n    Apple has really confused people with this whole thing. I think\nwe'll be answering this question for about the next year or so. There is\nno \"option\" to get an FPU on a C650. What you have is a choice of CPUs:\nthere is the 68LC040 that does not have an integrated FPU like the full\n'040 and is only present in the base 4/80 model of the C650 (AppleUSA).\nAnd there is the full '040 which you get when you order anything other\nthan the base 4/80 configuration. Therefore, since you have ordered one\nof the 8MB versions with on-board Ethernet models you will not be\ngetting the LC040. But even if you wanted to have the LC040 you wouldn't\nbe able to order a C650 with 8MB RAM, on-board Ethernet and an LC040.\nIt's not an \"option.\"\n    Also, a note to people out there that have 4/80 C650s and C610s\nthinking that there is an optional FPU, the '040 class chip cannot\nrecognize an external FPU, so there is no socket on the motherboard for\na FPU chip and you cannot go out and purchase an FPU on a PDS card or\nsomething like that. The only way to get an FPU in these machines is to\nreplace the LC040 with a full '040.

{"text":"Classify the following data:  \n\n\n\nTed, you're missing a vital point.  As Roger Lustig pointed out in a\nprevious response, the reason why Schott was banned from baseball was\nbecause she had been known to call and think in a racially biased manner on\na constant basis.  Such thoughts affected her hiring practices.  Bonilla,\non the other hand, was found to have mentioned this one word a single time.\n If he had been known to go around, criticizing homosexuals, it would be a\ndifferent story.  Furthermore, he is merely an athlete.  He doesn't have to\nhire anyone as Schott had to do.  Dave Pallone, the former NL umpire who is\nan admitted homosexual, has decided to assist in a protest before a Mets\ngame at Shea.  He, like you, thinks that Bonilla should be suspended from\nbaseball.  Pallone is hoping for a year's suspension.  In my opinion,\nthat's downright ludicrous.

{"text":"Classify the following data: \n\nLet us explore this interesting paragraph point by point, sentence by\nsentence.\n\n\n1) We are talking about origins, not merely science.\n\nOrigins of what?  Are we speaking of the origins of life, the human\nspecies, the universe, physical law, biological diversity or what?\n\n2) Science cannot explain origins.\n\nThis is a false statement unless it is carefully qualified.  It depends\non what origins we are talking about.\n\n3) For a person to exclude anything but science from the issue of origins\nis to say that there is no higher truth than science.\n\nAgain, this is a false statement.  To begin with, the notion of \"higher\ntruth\" is distinctly dubious.  Many people believe that there are ways\nto ascertain truth that are not in the repetoire of science; they even\nbelieve that there are ways that are more reliable and certain.  Many\nbelieve that there are truths that cannot be expressed using the language\nof science.  Let it be so.  These truths are neither \"higher\" or \n\"lower\"; they are simply true.\n\nMore to the point, restricting one's discussion of origins to science\ndoes not reject other sources of knowledge; it simply restricts the\nscope of discussion.\n\n4) This is a false premise.\n\nIf this is intended as asserting that the previous sentence was false\nthen (4) is actually true.  However the context identifies it as another\nfalse [or at least theologically unsound] statement.\n\n5) By the way, I enjoy science.\n\nOn the evidence Mr. Rawlins lacks sufficient understanding of science\nto enjoy science in any meaningful sense.  One might just as well say\nthat one enjoys literature written in a language that one cannot read.\nHowever one cannot mark this sentence as false -- to follow the analogy,\nperhaps he likes the pretty shapes of the letters.\n\n6) It is truly a wonder observing God's creation.\n\nLet us not quibble; count this one as true.\n\n7) Macroevolution is a mixture of 15 percent science and 85 percent\nreligion [guaranteed within three percent error :) ]\n\nStill another false statement.  However one can make it come out true\nwith the following contextual modification:\n\n\"Macroevolution, as misunderstood by Rawline, is a mixture of 15 percent\nof what Rawlins erroneously thinks of as science, and 85 percent of\nwhat Rawlins erroneously thinks of as religion.\"\n\n-----\n\nIt is distinctly noticeable that Mr. Rawlins fails miserably to touch\non truth except when he reports personally on what he feels.  [I do\nhim the justice of assuming that he is not misinforming us as to his\npersonal reactions.]  One can account for this by the hypothesis that\nhe has an idiosyncratic and personal concept of truth.","label":"talk.religion.misc"}
{"text":"Classify the following data: For several years I have been dealing with reccurring corneal  erosion.    There\ndoes  not  seem  to be much known about the cause of such a problem.  My current\nepisode is pretty bad since it is located in the middle of the cornea.  If  it's\nbad  enough, the usual treatment for it is puncture therapy.  However, my doctor\nthis time is trying to let it heal by  itself  by  putting  a  contact  lens  to\nprotect the area.  Apparently the problem is not that common, but I'd be curious\nif anyone else out there has a similar problem, perhaps to see if a cause can be\nfound. ","label":"sci.med"}

{"text":"Classify the following data: \n\nThey are news because they are the exceptions. And the 'Islamic Holocaust'\nis much the topic of the day. The historical evidence proves that during \nthe period of 1914 to 1920, the Armenian Government ordered, incited, \nassisted and participated in the genocide of 2.5 million Muslim people \nbecause of race, religion and national origin. Armenians perpetrated acts \nof sabotage, destroyed telephone cables, blew up bridges, blocked passes, \nset up ambushes, attacked security stations and small Turkish outposts \nbehind the Ottoman Army lines on the one hand, and on the other ruthlessly \nattacked Turkish and Kurdish villages, slaughtering the Turkish population \nindiscriminately, women, children, old and young alike. Innocent \nMuslims were one by one cruelly bayonetted to death, or massacred with \naxes and swords, or else shut up in mosques or in schools and then burnt\nalive as can be seen below.\n\nWidespread Armenian massacres of innocent Muslims took place in regions \nof Van, Kars, Sivas, Erzurum, Bitlis, Erzincan, Mus, Diyarbakir and \nMaras. The Ottoman Army, while fighting to prevent the Russian invasion,\nalso had to deal with Armenian genocide squads who cowardly hit from \nbehind. The Armenian genocide of the Muslims spread to all parts of \nEastern Anatolia. Starting from late 1914, Armenians committed \nwidespread massacres and genocide in Eastern Anatolia, because the arena\nwas left to the Armenians. Almost every Turkish town and village from \nErzincan up to Azerbaidjan suffered large scale massacres and genocide \nby Armenians and the Turkish genocide has been documented by Armenian, \nRussian, American, British, Ottoman, German, Austrian and French \njournalists and officers who observed the first genocide of this century\ncommitted by the blood-thirsty Armenian genocide squads.\n\nThe Ottoman Army, liberating Trabzon, Bayburt, Erzincan, Erzurum, \nKars and other regions from the Russians, saw that the cities and their \nvillages had been destroyed and burnt, people slaughtered, massacred.\nThe massacres conducted by Armenians, which became a black stain for\nhumanity, shocked and disgusted even the Russian, British, German,\nAustrian, French and American authorities.\n\nAlmost every Ottoman document is related to Armenian massacres and \ncruelties. The inhuman treatment, cruelties, atrocities, genocide by \nArmenian genocide squads perpetrated against innocent Moslem Turkish \nand Kurdish people, are sufficiently reflected in historical documents. \nEven today over seventy-five years later, the terrifying screams of \nthe victims of these cruelties can be heard.\n\n\nSource: Documents: Volume I (1919).\n        \"Document No: 76,\" Archive No: 1/2, Cabin No: 109, Drawer \n        No: 3, File No: 346, Section No: 427(1385), Contents No: 3, 52-53.\n        (To Lt.

Although two months\n have elapsed since the clearing of the territories of Armenian gangs, I\n have been observing the evidence of the cruelties of the Armenians at \n almost every step. All the villages from Trabzon to Erzincan and from\n Erzincan to Erzurum are destroyed. Corpses of Turks brutally and cruelly\n slain are everywhere. According to accounts by those who were able to\n save their lives by escaping to mountains, the first horrible and fearful\n events begun when the Russian forces evacuated the places which were then\n taken over by Armenian gangs. The Russians usually treated the people \n well, but the people feared the intervention of the Armenians. Once these\n places had been taken over by the Armenians, however, the massacres begun.\n They clearly announced their intention of clearing what they called the\n Armenian and Kurdish land from the Turks and thus, solve the nationality\n problem. Today I had the opportunity to meet Austrian and German soldiers\n who had escaped from Russian prison camps and come from Kars and\n Alexander Paul (Gumru-Leninakan)...Russian officers tried to save the \n Turks and there were clashes between Russian officers and Armenian gangs. \n I am now in Erzurum, and what I see is terrible. Almost the whole city is \n destroyed. The smell of the corpses still fills the air. Although there are \n speculations that Armenian gangs murdered Austrian and German prisoners as \n well, I could not get the supporting evidence in this regard, but there is \n proof of murdering of Turkish prisoners of war.\"\n\n                                                     Dr. Stephan Eshnanie\n\nSerdar Argic","label":"talk.politics.mideast"}

It is easy to enjoy them, but they cause great\nanxiety. The most virtious among them are libertines. But the most\ncorrupt are whores.

If it is only\nused for that purpose, and does not extend to electronic mail or file\nencryption, then it IS an improvement over the current mass-produced\nstandard civilian technology which, with a few exceptions, is limited to\neasy-to-break inverters.\n\nNote that the big issue for the feds is the continued ability to wiretap.\nBefore we go off the deep end with long discusions about secure crypto for\ne-mail and files, let's focus on this.\n\nOne question that was not asked in the release is whether this proposal is\nlimited to telephony, or if the government intends to expand it.\n\nThough I share many of the concerns expressed by some, I find the proposal\nless threatening than many others, since right now most Americans have no\nsecure telephony, and any jerk with a pair of clip leads and a \"goat\" can\neavesdrop. This would also plug up the security hole in cellular and\ncordless phones.\n\n-------\n\nReading between the lines, I infer that the system is highly secure\nwithout access to the keys. This would meet the needs of U.S. businesses\nconfronted by rich and powerful adversaries, including French and Japanese\nsecurity services and rich Japanese companies. It allows the NSA to make\navailable some of its better stuff while protecting law enforcement needs.\n\nMost legitimate U.S. corporations trust the NSA, and would be delighted to\nhave a high-security system certified by them, even at the price of\ndepositing keys in escrow. I see no difficulty in creating a reliable\nescrow. Corporations entrust their secrets to attorneys every day of the\nweek, and that system has worked pretty well.\n\nFrom my point of view this is a fair starting point. There are concerns that\nneed to be addressed, including the reliability of the escrows. But in\nreturn we get access to high-security crypto. Many have suggested that DES\nand other systems may be breakable by the NSA and hence others similarly\nskilled and endowed. There is at least a good possibility (which should be\nchecked) that the proposed system is not so breakable. It doesn't have to\nbe, nor does it have to have trapdoors, if the government can get the keys\npursuant to a legitimate court order. Thus they can protect legitimate\ncommunications against economic adversaries, while still being able to\neavesdrop on crooks pursuant to a court order.\n\n------\n\nIn discussing this, let's try to avoid the nastiness, personal attacks and\nnoise of some previous threads. This is a substantive and technical issue,\nand personal remarks have no place in such a discussion.\n","label":"sci.crypt"}

I owned a 1985 Toyota Celica\nGT.  I decided to buy myself a gift - a more exotic car.  Front runners\nincluded the Toyota Supra Turbo and the Porsche 924 (1987 model years).\nI narrowed it down to those two.  I liked the simplicity and handling\n(and snob appeal, too) of driving a Porsche.  The Supra Turbo was less\nmoney and had more features and performance - almost a personal luxury\ncar.  It had better acceleration and a higher top speed than the 924.\nI was almost ready to give in to a buying impulse for the 924, but i\ndecided to stop by my insurance agent's office on the way.  I asked\nabout what would happen to my rate with either car.\n \n\"If you buy the Supra, your rate classification will be the same as\nthe Celica (the '85 Celica was considered a subcompact and for that\nyear was rated as one of the safest cars), with a slight increase because\nthe car will be 2 years newer.  Our lower-risk division will continue\nto handle your account.\n \n\"If you buy the Porsche 924, we'll have to change you to the standard\n[higher] rate company and your rate will double.  And if you go with\na 944, it's another story again - we'll cover the rest of this year,\nbut cancel you after that.\"\n \n\"But the Supra is much faster than the 924, and the 924 is actually\nfaster than the [standard] 944.  That doens't make sense.\"\n \n That's what the book says.  We don't insure Corvettes, either.  For\nsome reason, the underwriters consider Supras - and their drivers -\nas very traditional and conservative.\"\n \nI eventually went with the Supra for a number of reasons.  The Porsche\ndealer had a nice salesman to get me interested, but a tough high-pressure\nguy in the back room.  At equal monthly payments, it would have taken\na year longer to pay for the Porsche, plus its higher insurance.  I\nconcluded that the high insurance was related to probability of auto\ntheft.\n \n   /|/| /||)|/  /~ /\\| |\\|)[~|)/~   |   Everyone's entitled to MY opinion.\n  / | |/ ||\\|\\  \\_|\\/|_|/|)[_|\\\\_|  |      goldberg@oasys.dt.navy.mil\n========Imagination is more important than knowledge. - Albert Einstein=======\n \n \n \n \n \n======================================================================== 32\n \nI live in Idaho.

{"text":"Classify the following data: \n\n\n# I hope I gave you a fairly solid answer to this one: I simply don't agree\n# with the embodied version of a Satan who is a separate creation or a force.\n\n\n\n# And there are quite physical descriptions of Heaven and Hell in the\n# Holy Qur'an, the Bible, etc.  There have been times in the spiritual\n# and intellectual evolution of the modern human when these physical\n# descriptions of Heaven, Hell, and Satan were taken quite literally\n# and that *worked* for the time.  As I mentioned in the Tradition\n# cited above, for example, it was sufficient in the absence of a theory\n# about germs and disease spread by worms to simply describe the \"evil\"\n# which was passed to a consumer of spoiled food as \"satanic.\"\n\n     Which begs the question: if Satan in this case is\n     metaphorical, how can you be certain Allah is not\n     the same way?\n\n# The bottom line here, however, is that describing a spiritual plane\n# in human language is something like describing \"color\" to a person\n# who has been blind from birth.  You may want to read the book\n# FLATLAND (if you haven't already) or THE DRAGON'S EGG.  The first\n# is intended as a light hearted description of a mathematical con-\n# cept...\n\n[some deleted for space saving]\n\n# When language fails because it cannot be used to adequately describe\n# another dimension which cannot be experienced by the speakers, then\n# such conventions as metaphor, allegory, and the like come to be\n# necessary.  The \"unseen\" is described in terms which have reference`\n# and meaning for the reader/listener.  But, like all models, a compro-\n# mise must be made when speaking metaphorically: clarity and directness\n# of meaning, equivalence of perception, and the like are all\n# crippled.  But what else can you do?\n\n     This is why I asked the above.  How would you then\n     know God exists as a spirit or being rather than\n     just being metaphorical?  I mean, it's okay to say\n     \"well, Satan is just metaphorical,\" but then you\n     have to justify this belief AND justify that God is\n     not some metaphor for something else.\n\n     I say this because there are many, many instances of\n     Satan described as a being (such as the tormentor in \n     the Old Testament book of Job, or the temptor in the\n     New Testament Gospels).  In the same way, God too is\n     described as a being (or spirit.)  How am I to know\n     one is metaphorical and not the other.\n\n     Further, belief in God isn't a bar to evil.  Let's\n     consider the case of Satanists: even if Satan were\n     metaphorical, the Satanist would have to believe\n     in God to justify this belief.  Again, we have a \n     case where someone does believe in God, but by\n     religious standards, they are \"evil.\"  If Bobby\n     does see this, let him address this question also.\n\n[deleted some more on \"metaphor\"]\n\n\nStephen\n\n    _/_/_/_/  _/_/_/_/   _/       _/    * Atheist\n   _/        _/    _/   _/ _/ _/ _/     * Libertarian\n  _/_/_/_/  _/_/_/_/   _/   _/  _/      * Pro-individuality\n       _/  _/     _/  _/       _/       * Pro-responsibility\n_/_/_/_/  _/      _/ _/       _/ Jr.    * and all that jazz...\n\n","label":"alt.atheism"}

{"text":"Classify the following data: Another issue of importance.  Was the crucification the will of God or\na tragic mistake.  I believe it was a tragic mistake.  God's will can\nnever be accomplished through the disbelief of man.  Jesus came to\nthis world to build the kingdom of heaven on the earth.  He\ndesperately wanted the Jewish people to accept him as the Messiah.  If\nthe crucification was the will of God how could Jesus pray that this\ncup pass from him.  Was this out of weakness.  NEVER.  Many men and\nwomen have given their lives for their country or other noble causes.\nIs Jesus less than these.  No he is not.  He knew the crucification\nwas NOT the will of GOD.  God's will was that the Jewish people accept\nJesus as the Messiah and that the kingdom of Heaven be established on\nthe earth with Jesus as it's head. (Just like the Jewish people\nexpected). If this had happened 2000 years ago can you imagine what\nkind of world we would live in today.  It would be a very different\nworld.  And that is eactly what GOD wanted.  Men and women of that age\ncould have been saved by following the living Messiah while he was on\nthe earth.  Jesus could have established a sinless lineage that would\nhave continued his reign after his ascension to the spiritual world to\nlive with GOD.  Now the kingdom of heaven on the earth will have to\nwait for Christ's return.  But when he returns will he be recognized\nand will he find faith on this earth.  Isn't it about time for his\nreturn.  It's been almost 2000 years.\n\nMike\n\n\n\nAnd the two simplest refutations are these:\n\n(1)  What impact?  The only record of impact comes from the New Testament.\nI have no guarantee that its books are in the least accurate, and that\nthe recorded \"impact\" actually happened.  I find it interesting that no other\ncontemporary source records an eclipse, an earthquake, a temple curtain\nbeing torn, etc.  The earliest written claim we have of Jesus' resurrection\nis from the Pauline epistles, none of which were written sooner than 20 years\nafter the supposed event.\n\n(2)  It seems probable that no one displayed the body of Jesus because no\none knew where it was.  I personally believe that the most likely\nexplanation was that the body was stolen (by disciples, or by graverobbers).\nDon't bother with the point about the guards ... it only appears in one\ngospel, and seems like exactly the sort of thing early Christians might make\nup in order to counter the grave-robbing charge.  The New Testament does\nrecord that Jews believed the body had been stolen.  If there were really\nguards, they could not have effectively made this claim, as they did.","label":"soc.religion.christian"}

They left and I had an attack. I realized that the dan-\nger was past, and stopped controlling myself. I relaxed for a moment and the \nphysical pain immediately made itself felt. My heart and kidneys hurt. I had \nan awful kidney attack. I rolled back and forth on top of those Christmas\nornaments, howling and howling. I didn't know where I was or how long this \nwent on. When we figured out the time, later it turned out that I howled and \nwas in pain for around an hour. Then all my strength was gone and I burst into\ntears, I started feeling sorry for myself, and so on and so forth . . .\n\nThen someone came into the room. I think I hear someone calling my name. I \nwant to respond and restrain myself, I think that I'm hallucinating. I am \nsilent, and then it continues: it seems that first a man's voice is calling\nme, then a woman's. Later I found out that Mamma had sent our neighbor, the\none whose apartment she was hiding in, Uncle Sabir Kasumov, to our place, \ntelling him, \"I know that they've killed Lyuda. Go there and at least bring \nher corpse to me so they don't violate her corpse.\" He went and returned empty\nhanded, but Mamma thought he just didn't want to carry the corpse into his \napartment. She sent him another time, and then sent his wife, and they were \nwalking through the rooms looking for me, but I didn't answer their calls. \nThere was no light, they had smashed the chandeliers and lamps.\n\nThey started the pogrom in our apartment around five o'clock, and at 9:30 I \nwent down to the Kasumovs'. I went down the stairs myself. I walked out of the\napartment: how long can you wait for your own death, how long can you be \ncowardly, afraid? Come what will. I walked out and started knocking on the \ndoors one after the next. No one, not on the fifth floor, not on the fourth, \nopened the door. On the third floor, on the landing of the stairway, Uncle \nSabir's son started to shout, \"Aunt Roza, don't cry, Lyuda's alive!\" He \nknocked on his own door and out came Aunt Tanya, Igor, and after them, Mamma. \nAunt Tanya, Uncle Sabir's wife, is an Urdmurt. All of us were in their \napartment. I didn't see Karina, but she was in their home, too, Lying\ndelirious, she had a fever. Marina was there too, and my father and mother.\nAll of my family had gathered there.\n   \nAt the door I lost consciousness. Igor and Aunt Tanya carried me into the\napartment.\n\nLater I found out what they had done to our Karina. Mamma said, \"Lyuda, \nKarina's in really serious condition, she's probably dying. If she recognizes \nyou, don't cry, don't tell her that her face looks so awful.\" It was as though\nher whole face was paralyzed, you know, everything was pushed over to one \nside, her eye was all swollen, and everything flowed together, her lips, her \ncheeks . . . It was as though they had dragged her right side around the whole\nmicrodistrict, that's how disfigured her face was. I said, \"Fine.\" Mamma was \nafraid to go into the room, because she went in and hugged Karina and started \nto cry. I went in. As soon as I saw her my legs gave way. I fell down near the\nbed, hugged her legs and started kissing them and crying. She opened the eye \nthat was intact, looked at me, and said, \"Who is it?\" But I could barely talk, \nmy whole face was so badly beaten. I didn't say, but rather muttered something\ntender, something incomprehensible, but tender, \"My Karochka, my Karina, my \nlittle golden one . . . \" She understood me.\n\nThen Igor brought me some water, I drank it down and moistened Karina's lips. \nShe started to groan. She was saying something to me, but I couldn't \nunderstand it. Then I made out, \"It hurts, I hurt all over.\" Her hair was \nglued down with blood. I stroked her forehead, her head, she had grit on her \nforehead, and on her lips . . . She was groaning again, and I don't know how \nto help her. She calls me over with her hand, come closer. I go to her. She's\nsaying something to me, but I can't understand her. Igor brings her a pencil \nand paper and says, \"Write it down.\" She shakes her head as if to say, no, I \ncan't write. I can't understand what she's saying. She wanted to tell me \nsomething, but she couldn't. I say, \"Karina, just lie there a little while,\nthen maybe you'll feel better and you can tell me then.\" And then she says,\n\"Maybe it'll be too late.\" And I completely . . . just broke down, I couldn't\ncontrol myself.\n\nThen I moistened my hand in the water and wiped her forehead and eye. I dipped\na handkerchief into the water and squeezed a little water onto her lips. She \nsays, \"Lyuda, we're not saved yet, we have to go somewhere else. Out of this \ndamned house. They want to kill us, I know. They'll find us here, too. We need\nto call Urshan.\" She repeated this to me for almost a whole hour, Until I \nunderstood her every word. I ask, \"What's his number?\" Urshan Feyruzovich, \nthat's the head of the administration where she works. \"We have to call him.\" \nBut I didn't know his home number. I say, \"Karina, what's his number?\" She \nsays, \"I can't remember.\" I say, \"Who knows his number? Who can I call?\" She \nsays, \"I don't know anything, leave me alone.\"\n\nI went out of the room. Igor stayed to watch over her and sat there, he was \ncrying, too. I say, \"Mamma, Karina says that we have to call Urshan. How can \nwe call him? Who knows his telephone number?\" I tell Marina, \"Think, think, \nwho can we call to find out?\" She started calling; several people didn't \nanswer. She called a girlfriend, her girlfriend called another girlfriend and \nfound out the number and called us back. The boss's wife answered and said he \nwas at the dacha. My voice keeps cracking, I can't talk normally. She says, \n\"Lyuda, don't panic, get a hold of yourself, go out to those hooligans and \ntell them that they just can't do that.\" She still didn't know what was really\ngoing on. I said, \"It's easy for you to say that, you don't understand what's \nhappening. They are killing people here. I don't think there is a single \nArmenian left in the building, they've cut them all up. I'm even surprised \nthat we managed to save ourselves. \"She says, \"Well, OK, if it's that serious \n. . . \" And all the same she's thinking that my emotions are all churned up \nand that I'm fearing for my life, that in fact it's not all that bad. \"OK, \nfine, fine,\" she says, \"if you're afraid, OK, as soon as Urshan comes back \nI'll send him over.\"\n\nWe called again because they had just started robbing the apartment directly \nunder Aunt Tanya's, on the second floor, Asya Dallakian's apartment. She \nwasn't home, she was staying with her daughter in Karabagh. They destroyed \neverything there . . . We realized that they still might come back. We kept on\ntrying to get through to Aunt Tanya--Urshan's wife is named Tanya too and \nfinally we get through. She says, \"Yes, he's come home, he's leaving for your \nplace now.\" He came. Of course he didn't know what was happening, either, \nbecause he brought two of his daughters with him. He came over in his jeep \nwith his two daughters, like he was going on an outing. He came and saw what \nshape we were in and what was going on in town and got frightened. He has \ngrown up daughters, they're almost my age.\n\nThe three of us carried out Karina, tossed a coat on her and a warm scarf, and\nwent down to his car. He took Karina and me to the Maternity Home. . . No, \nfirst they took us to the po]ice precinct. They had stretchers ready. As\nsoon as we got out of the car they put Karina and me on stretchers and said\nthat we were in serious condition and that we mustn't move, we might have\nfractures. From the stretcher I saw about 30 soldiers sitting and lying on the\nfirst floor, bandaged, on the concrete floor, groaning . . . This was around\neleven o'clock at night. We had left the house somewhere around 1:30. When I \nsaw those soldiers I realized that a war was going on: soldiers, enemies\n. . . everything just like a war.\n\nThey carried me into some office on the stretcher. The emergency medical\npeople from Baku were there. The medical attendant there was an older \nArmenian. Urshan told him what they had done to Karina because she's so proud \nshe would never have told. And this aging Armenian . . . his name was Uncle \nArkady, I think, because someone said \"Arkady, get an injection ready,\" he \nstarted to fill a syringe, and turned around so as to give Karina a shot. But \nwhen he looked at her face he became ill. And he was an old man, in his \nsixties, his hair was all grey, and his moustache, too. He hugged Karina and \nstarted to cry: \"What have they done to you?!\" He was speaking Armenian. \"What\nhave they done to you?!\" Karina didn't say anything. Mamma came in then, and \nshe started to cry, too. The man tried to calm her. \"I'll give you a shot.\" \nMamma tells him, \"I don't need any shot. Where is the government? Just what \nare they doing? Look what they've done to my children! They're killing people,\nand you're just sitting here!\" Some teacups were standing on the table in \nthere. \"You're sitting here drinking tea! Look what they've done to my \ndaughters! Look what they've turned them into!\" They gave her something to \ndrink, some heart medicine, I think. They gave Karina an injection and the\ndoctor said that she had to be taken to the Maternity Home immediately. Papa \nand Urshan, I think, even though Papa was in bad shape, helped carry Karina \nout. When they put her on the stretcher, none of the medics got near her. I \ndon't know, maybe there weren't any orderlies. Then they came to me: \"What's \nthe matter with you?\" Their tone was so official that I wrapped myself tighter\nin the half-length coat. I had a blanket on, too, an orange one, Aunt Tanya's.\nI said, \"I'm fine.\" Uncle Arkady came over and was soothing me, and then told \nthe doctor, \"You leave, let a woman examine her.\" A woman came, an \nAzerbaijani, I believe, and said, \"What's wrong with you?\" I was wearing my \nsister Lyuda's nightshirt, the sister who at this time was in Yerevan. When \nshe was nursing her infant she had cut out a big hole in it so that it would \nbe easier to breast feed the baby. I tore the night shirt some more and showed\nher. I took it off my shoulders and turned my back to her. There was a huge \nwound, about the size of a hand, on my back, from the Indian vase. She said \nsomething to them and they gave me two shots. She said that it should be \ndressed with something, but that they'd do that in the hospital.\n\nThey put me on a stretcher, too. They started looking for people to carry me. \nI raised up my head a little and wanted to sit up, and this woman, I don't \nknow if she was a doctor or a nurse, said, \"Lie still, you mustn't move.\" When\nI was lying back down I saw two policemen leading a man. His profile seemed \nvery familiar to me. I shouted, \"Stop!\" One of the policemen turned and says, \n\"What do you want?\" I say, \"Bring him to me, I want to look at him.\" They \nbrought him over and I said, \"That person was just in our apartment and he \njust raped me and my sister. I recognize him, note it down.\" They said, \n\"Fine,\" but didn't write it down and led him on. I don't know where they were \ntaking him.\n\nThen they put my stretcher near where the injured and beaten soldiers were \nsitting. They went to look for the ambulance driver so he would bring the car \nup closer. One of the soldiers started talking to me, \"Sister . . . \" I don't \nremember the conversation exactly, but he asked me were we lived and what they\ndid to us. I asked him, \"Where are you from?\" He said that he was from Ufa. \nApparently they were the first that were brought in. The Ufa police. Later I \nlearned that they suffered most of all. He says, \"OK, you're Armenians, they \ndidn't get along with you, but I'm a Russian,\" he says, \"what are they trying \nto kill me for?\" Oh, I remembered something else. When I went out onto the \nbalcony with Kuliyev for a hammer and nails I looked out the window and saw \ntwo Azerbaijanis beating a soldier near the kindergarten. He was pressed \nagainst the fence and he covered his head with his arms, they were beating him\nwith his own club. The way he cried \"Mamma\" made my skin crawl. I don't know \nwhat they did to him, if he's still alive or not. And something else. Before \nhe attack on our house we saw sheets, clothes, and some dishes flying from the\nthird or fourth floor of the neighboring building, but I didn't think it was \nAzerbaijanis attacking Armenians. I thought that something was on fire or they\nwere throwing something they didn't need out, or someone was fighting with \nsomeone. It was only later, when they were burning a passenger car in the \nyard, when the neighbors said that they were doing that to the Armenians, that\nI realized that this was serious, that it was anti-Armenian.\n\nThey took Karina and me to the Sumgait Maternity Home. Mamma went to them too \nand said, \"I've been beaten too, help me.\" But they just ignored her. My \nfather went to them and said in a guilty voice, as though it was his fault \nthat he'd been beaten, and says, \"My ribs hurt so much, those creeps have \nprobably broken my ribs. Please look at them.\" The doctor says, \"That's not my\njob.\" Urshan said, \"Fine, I'll take you to my place and if we need a doctor, \nI'll find you one. I'll bring one and have him look at you. And he drove them \nto his apartment.\n\nMarina and I stayed there. They examined us. I was more struck by what the \ndoctor said than by what those Azerbaijanis in our apartment did to us. I \nwasn't surprised when they beat us they wanted to beat us, but I was very\nsurprised that in a Soviet medical facility a woman who had taken the\nHippocratic Oath could talk to victims like that. By happy--or unhappy--\ncoincidence we were seen by the doctor that had delivered our Karina. And she,\nhaving examined Karina, said, \"No problem, you got off pretty good. Not like \nthey did in Kafan, when you Armenians were killing and raping our women.\n\"Karina was in such terrible condition that she couldn't say anything--she\nwould certainly have had something to say! Then they examined me. The same \nstory. They put us in a separate ward. No shots, no medicinal powders, no \ndrugs. Absolutely none! They didn't even give us tea. All the women there soon\nfound out that in ward such and such were Armenians who had been raped. And\nthey started coming and peering through the keyhole, the way people look at \nzoo animals. Karina didn't see this, she was lying there, and I kept her from \nseeing it.\n\nThey put Ira B. in our ward. She had also been raped. True, she didn't have \nany serious bodily injuries, but when she told me what had happened at their \nplace, I felt worse for them than I did for us. Because when they raped Ira \nher daughter was in the room, she was under the bed on which it happened. And\nIra was holding her daughter's hand, the one who was hiding under the bed.\nWhen they were beating Ira or taking her earrings off, gold, when she \ninvoluntarily let go of her daughter's hand, her daughter took her hand again.\nHer daughter is in the fourth grade, she's 11 years old. I felt really awful \nwhen I heard that. Ira asked them not to harm her daughter, she said, \"Do what\nyou want with me, just leave my daughter alone.\" Well, they did what they \nwanted. They threatened to kill her daughter if she got in their way. Now I \nwould be surprised if the criminals had behaved any other way that night. It \nwas simply Bartholomew's Night, I say, they did what they would love to do \nevery day: steal, kill, rape . . .\n\nMany are surprised that those animals didn't harm the children. The beasts \nexplained it like this: this would be repeated in 15 to 20 years, and those \nchildren would be grown, and then, as they put it, \"we'll come take the \npleasure out of their lives, those children.\" This was about the girls that\nwould be young women in 15 years. They were thinking about their tomorrow \nbecause they were sure that there would be no trial and no investigation, just\nas there was no trial or investigation in 1915, and that those girls could be \nof some use in 15 years. This I heard from the investigators; one of the \nvictims testified to it. That's how they described their own natures, that\nthey would still be bloodthirsty in 15 to 20 years, and in 100 years--they\nthemselves said that.\n\nAnd this, too. Everyone is surprised that they didn't harm our Marina. Many \npeople say that they either were drunk or had smoked too much. I don't know \nwhy their eyes were red. Maybe because they hadn't slept the night before, \nmaybe for some other reason, I don't know. But they hadn't been smoking and \nthey weren't drunk, I'm positive, because someone who has smoked will stop at \nnothing he has the urge to do. And they spoke in a cultured fashion with \nMarina: \"Little sister, don't be afraid, we won't harm you, don't look over \nthere [where I was], you might be frightened. You're a Muslim, a Muslim woman \nshouldn't see such things.\" So they were really quite sober . . .\n\nSo we came out of that story alive. Each every day we have lived since it all \nhappened bears the mark of that day. It wasn't even a day, of those several \nhours. Father still can't look us in the eyes. He still feels guilty for what\nhappened to Karina, Mother, and me. Because of his nerves he's started talk-\ning to himself, I've heard him argue with himself several times when he\nthought no one is listening: \"Listen,\" he'll say, \"what could I do? What could\nI do alone, how could I protect them?\" I don't know where to find the words,\nit's not that I'm happy, but I am glad that he didn't see it all happen. \nThat's the only thing they spared us . . . or maybe it happened by chance. Of \ncourse he knows it all, but there's no way you could imagine every last detail\nof what happened. And there were so many conversations: Karina and I spoke\ntogether in private, and we talked with Mamma, too. But Father was never\npresent at those conversations. We spare him that, if you can say that. And\nwhen the investigator comes to the house, we don't speak with Father present.\n\nOn February 29, the next clay, Karina and I were discharged from the hospital.\nFirst they released me, but since martial law had been declared in the city, \nthe soldiers took me to the police precinct in an armored personnel carrier. \nThere were many people there, Armenian victims. I met the Tovmasian family \nthere. From them I learned that Rafik and their Uncle Grant had died. They \nwere sure that both had died. They were talking to me and Raya, Rafik's wife \nand Grant's daughter, and her mother, were both crying.\n\nThen they took us all out of the office on the first floor into the yard.\nThere's a little one-room house outside there, a recreation and reading area.\nThey took us in there. The women were afraid to go because they thought\nthat they were shooing us out of the police precinct because it had become\nso dangerous that even the people working at the precinct wanted to hide.\nThe women were shouting. They explained to them: \"We want to hide you\nbetter because it's possible there will be an attack on the police precinct.\"\n\nWe went into the little house. There were no chairs or tables in there. We\nhad children with us and they were hungry; we even had infants who needed to \nhave their diapers changed. No one had anything with them. It was just awful. \nThey kept us there for 24 hours. From the window of the one room house you \ncould see that there were Azerbaijanis standing on the fences around the \npolice precinct, as though they were spying on us. The police precinct is \nsurrounded by a wall, like a fence, and it's electrified, but if they were \nstanding on the wall, it means the electricity was shut off. This brought \ngreat psychological pressure to bear on us, particularly on those who hadn't \njust walked out of their apartments, but who hadn't slept for 24 hours, or 48,\nor those who had suffered physically and spiritually, the ones who had lost \nfamily members. For us it was another ordeal. We were especially frightened \nwhen all the precinct employees suddenly disappeared. We couldn't see a single\nperson, not in the courtyard and not in the windows. We thought that they must\nhave already been hiding under the building, that they must have some secret \nroom down there. People were panicking: they started throwing themselves at\none another . . . That's the way it is on a sinking ship. We heard those \npeople, mainly young people, whistling and whopping on the walls. We felt that\nthe end was approaching. I was completely terrified: I had left Karina in the \nhospital and didn't know where my parents were. I was sort of calm about my \nparents, I was thinking only about Karina, if, Heaven forbid, they should \nattack the hospital, they would immediately tell them that there was an \nArmenian in there, and something terrible would happen to Karina again, and \nshe wouldn't be able to take it.\n\nThen soldiers with dogs appeared. When they saw the dogs some of the people \nclimbed down off the fence. Then they brought in about another 30 soldiers.\nThey all had machine guns in readiness, their fingers on the triggers. We \ncalmed down a little. They brought us chairs and brought the children some \nlittle cots and showed us where we could wash our hands, and took the children\nto the toilet. But we all sat there hungry, but to be honest, it would never \nhave occurred to any of us that we hadn't eaten for two days and that people \ndo eat.\n\nThen, closer to nightfall, they brought a group of detained criminals. They \nwere being watched by soldiers with guard dogs. One of the men came back from \nthe courtyard and told us about it. Raya Tovmasian . . . it was like a \ndifferent woman had been substituted. Earlier she had been crying, wailing, \nand calling out: \"Oh, Rafik!,\" but when she heard about this such a rage came \nover her! She jumped up, she had a coat on, and she started to roll up her \nsleeves like she was getting ready to beat someone. And suddenly there were \nsoldiers, and dogs, and lots of people. She ran over to them. The bandits were\nstanding there with their hands above their heads facing the wall. She went up\nto one of them and grabbed him by the collar and started to shake and thrash \nhim! Then, on to a second, and a third. Everyone was rooted to the spot. Not \none of the soldiers moved, no one went up to help or made her stop her from \ndoing it. And the bandits fell down and covered their heads with their hands, \nmuttering something. She came back and sat down, and something akin to a smile\nappeared on her face. She became so quiet: no tears, no cries. Then that round\nwas over and she went back to beat them again. She was walking and cursing \nterribly: take that, and that, they killed my husband, the bastards, the \ncreeps, and so on. Then she came back again and sat down. She probably did \nthis the whole night through, well, it wasn't really night, no one slept. She \nwent five or six times and beat them and returned. And she told the women, \n\"What are you sitting there for? They killed your husbands and children, they \nraped, and you're just sitting there. You're sitting and talking as though \nnothing had happened. Aren't you Armenians?\" She appealed to everyone, but no \none got up. I was just numb, I didn't have the strength to beat anyone, I \ncould barely hold myself up, all the more so since I had been standing for so \nmany hours--I was released at eleven o'clock in the morning and it was already\nafter ten at night because there weren't enough chairs, really it was the \nelderly and women with children who sat. I was on my feet the whole time. \nThere was nothing to breathe, the door was closed, and the men were smoking. \nThe situation was deplorable.\n\nAt eleven o'clock at night policemen came for us, local policemen, \nAzerbaijanis. They said, \"Get up. They've brought mattresses, you can wash up\nand put the children to bed.\" Now the women didn't want to leave this place, \neither. The place had become like home, it was safe, there were soldiers with \ndogs. If anyone went outside, the soldiers would say, \"Oh, it's our little \nfamily,\" and things like that. The soldiers felt this love, and probably, for \nthe first time in their lives perceived themselves as defenders. Everyone\nspoke from the heart, cried, and hugged them and they, with their loaded\nmachine guns in their hands, said, \"Grandmother, you mustn't approach me,\nI'm on guard.\" Our people would say, \"Oh, that's all right.\" They hugged\nthem, one woman even kissed one of the machine guns. This was all terribly\nmoving for me. And the small children kept wanting to pet the dogs.\n\nThey took us up to the second floor and said, \"You can undress and sleep in \nhere. Don't be afraid, the precinct is on guard, and it's quiet in the city.\"\nThis was the 29th, when the killing was going on in block 41A and in other\nplaces. Then we were told that all the Armenians were being gathered at the\nSK club and at the City Party Committee. They took us there. On the way I \nasked them to stop at the Maternity Home: I wanted to take Karina with me.\nI didn't know what was happening there. They told me, \"Don't worry, the\nMaternity Home is full of soldiers, more than mothers-to-be. So you can rest\nassured. I say, \"Well, I won't rest assured regardless, because the staff in\nthere is capable of anything.\"\n\nWhen I arrived at the City Party Committee it turned out that Karina had\nalready been brought there. They had seen fit to release her from the hospi-\ntal, deciding that she felt fine and was no longer in need of any care. Once\nwe were in the City Party Committee we gave free reign to our tears. We met \nacquaintances, but everyone was somehow divided into two groups, those who \nhadn't been injured, who were clothed, who had brought a pot of food with \nthem, and so on, and those, like me, like Raya, who were wearing whatever had \ncome their way. There were even people who were all made up, dolled up like \nthey had come from a wedding. There were people without shoes, naked people, \nhungry people, those who were crying, and those who had lost someone. And of \ncourse the stories and the talk were flying: \"Oh, I heard that they killed \nhim!\" \"What do you mean they killed him!\" \"He stayed at work!\" \"Do you know \nwhat's happening at this and such a plant? Talk like that.\n\nAnd then I met Aleksandr Mikhailovich Gukasian, the teacher. I know him very \nwell and respect him highly. I've known him for a long time. They had a small \nroom, well really it was more like a study-room. We spent a whole night \ntalking in that study once. On March 1 we heard that Bagirov [First Secretary \nof the Communist Party of Azerbaijan SSR] had arrived. Everyone ran to see \nBagirov, what news he had brought with him and how this was all being viewed \nfrom outside. He arrived and everyone went up to him to talk to him and ask \nhim things. Everyone was in a tremendous rage. But he was protected by \nsoldiers, and he went up to the second floor and didn't deign to speak with \nthe people. Apparently he had more important things to do.\n\nSeveral hours passed. Gukasian called me and says, \"Lyudochka, find another \ntwo or three. We're going to make up lists, they asked for them upstairs, \nlists of the dead, those whose whereabouts are unknown, and lists of people \nwho had pogroms of their apartments and of those whose cars were burned.\" I \nhad about 50 people in my list when they called me and said, \"Lyuda, your \nMamma has arrived, she's looking for you, she doesn't believe that you are \nalive and well and that you're here.\" I gave the lists to someone and asked \nthem to continue what I was doing and went off.\n\nThe list was imprecise, of course. It included Grant Adamian, Raya Tovmasian's\nfather, who was alive, but at the time they thought him dead. There was Engels\nGrigorian's father and aunt, Cherkez and Maria. The list also included the \nname of my girlfriend and neighbor, Zhanna Agabekian. One of the guys said \nthat he had been told that they chopped her head off in the courtyard in front\nof the Kosmos movie theater. We put her on the list too, and cried, but later \nit turned out that that was just a rumor, that in fact an hour earlier she had\nsomehow left Sumgait for the marina and from there had set sail for \nKrasnovodsk, where, thank God, she was alive and well. I should also say that \nin addition to those who died that list contained people who were rumored \nmissing or who were so badly wounded that they were given up for dead.                                                                 3\n\nAll the lists were taken to Bagirov. I don't remember how many dead were \ncontained in the list, but it's a fact that when Gukasian came in a couple \nof minutes later he was cursing and was terribly irate. I asked, \"What's \ngoing on?\" He said, \"Lyuda, can you imagine what animals, what scoundrels\nthey are! They say that they lost the list of the dead. Piotr Demichev\n[Member of the Politburo of the Central Committee of the Communist Party\nof the USSR] has just arrived, and we were supposed to submit the list to\nhim, so that he'd see the scope of the slaughter, of the tragedy, whether it\nwas one or fifty.\" They told him that the list had disappeared and they\nshould ask everyone who hadn't left for the Khimik boarding house all over\nagain. There were 26 people on our second list. I think that the number 26\nwas the one that got into the press and onto television and the radio, because\nthat's the list that Demichev got. I remember exactly that there were 26 \npeople on the list, I had even told Aleksandr Mikhailovich that that was only \na half of those that were on the first list. He said, \"Lyuda, please, try to\nremember at least one more.\" But I couldn't remember anyone else. But there\nwere more than 30 dead. Of that I am certain. The government and the Procuracy\ndon't count the people who died of fright, like sick people and old people \nwhose lives are threatened by any shock. They weren't registered as victims of\nthe Sumgait tragedy. And then there may be people we didn't know. So many \npeople left Sumgait between March 1 and 8! Most of them left for smaller towns\nin Russia, and especially to the Northern Caucasus, to Stavropol, and the \nKrasnodarsk Territory. We don't have any information on them. I know that \nthere are people who set out for parts around Moscow. In the periodical \nKrestyanka [Woman Farmer] there was a call for people who know how to milk \ncows, and for mechanics, and drivers, and I know a whole group of people went \nto help out. Also clearly not on our list are those people who died entering\nthe city, who were burned in their cars. No one knows about them, except the \nAzerbaijanis, who are hardly likely to say anything about it. And there's\nmore. A great many of the people who were raped were not included in the list \ndrawn up at the Procuracy. I know of three instances for sure, and I of course\ndon't know them all. I'm thinking of three women whose parents chose not to \npublicize what had happened, that is, they didn't take the matter to court, \nthey simply left. But in so doing they didn't cease being victims. One of them\nis the first cousin of my classmate Kocharian. She lived in Microdistrict No. \n8, on the fifth floor. I can't tell you the building number and I don't know \nher name. Then comes the neighbor of one of my relatives, she lived in \nMicrodistrict 1 near the gift shop. I don't know her name, she lives on the \nsame landing as the Sumgait procurator. They beat her father, he was holding \nthe door while his daughter hid, but he couldn't hold the door forever, and \nwhen she climbed over the balcony to the neighbors' they seized her by her \nbraid. Like the Azerbaijanis were saying, it was a very cultured mob, because \nthey didn't kill anyone, they only raped them and left. And the third one \n. . . I don't remember who the third one was anymore.\n\nThey transferred us on March 1. Karina still wasn't herself. Yes, we lived for\ndays in the SK, in the cultural facility, and at the Khimik. They lived there \nand I lived at the City Party Committee because I couldn't stay with Karina; \nit was too difficult for me, but I was at peace: she had survived. I could \nalready walk, but really it was honest words that held me up. Thanks to the \nsocial work I did there, I managed to persevere. Aleksandr Mikhailovich said, \n\"If it weren't for the work I would go insane.\" He and I put ourselves in gear\nand took everything upon ourselves: someone had an infant and needed diapers \nand free food, and we went to get them. The first days we bought everything, \nalthough we should have received it for free. They were supposed to have been \ndispensed free of charge, and they sold it to us. Then, when we found out it \nwas free, we went to Krayev. At the time, fortunately, you could still drop by\nto see him like a neighbor, all the more so since everything was still clearly\nvisible on our faces. Krayev sent a captain down and he resolved the issue.\n\nOn March 2 they sent two investigators to see us: Andrei Shirokov and Vladimir\nFedorovich Bibishev. The way it worked out, in our family they had considered \nonly Karina and me victims, maybe because she and I wound up in the hospital.\nMother and Father are considered witnesses, but not victims.\n\nShirokov was involved with Karina's case, and Bibishev, with mine. After I \ntold him everything, he and I planned to sit down with the identikit and\nrecord everyone I could remember while everything was still fresh in my mind. \nWe didn't work with the identikit until the very last day because the\nconditions weren't there. The investigative group worked slowly and did poor \nquality work solely because the situation wasn't conducive to working: there \nweren't enough automobiles, especially during the time when there was a \ncurfew, and there were no typewriters for typing transcripts, and no still or \nvideo cameras. I think that this was done on purpose. We're not so poor that \nwe can't supply our investigators with all that stuff. It was done especially \nto draw out the investigation, all the more so since the local authorities saw\nthat the Armenians were leaving at the speed of light, never to return to \nSumgait. And the Armenians had a lot to say I came to an agreement with \nBibishev, I told him myself, \"Don't you worry, if it takes us a month or two \nmonths, I'll be here. I'm not afraid, I looked death in the eyes five times in\nthose two days, I'll help you conduct the investigation.\"\n\nHe and I worked together a great deal, and I used this to shelter Karina, I\ngave them so much to do that for a while they didn't have the time to get to\nher, so that she would at least have a week or two to get back to being her-\nself. She was having difficulty breathing so we looked for a doctor to take x-\nrays. She couldn't eat or drink for nine days, she was nauseous. I didn't eat\nand drank virtually nothing for five days. Then, on the fifth day, when we\nwere in Baku already, the investigator told me, \"How long can you go on like \nthis? Well fine, so you don't want to eat, you don't love yourself, you're\nnot taking care of yourself, but you gave your word that you would see this\ninvestigation through. We need you.\" Then I started eating, because in fact I\nwas exhausted. It wasn't enough that I kept seeing those faces in our apart-\nment in my mind, every day I went to the investigative solitary confinement\ncells and prisons. I don't know . . . we were just everywhere! Probably in\nevery prison in the city of Baku and in all the solitary confinement cells of\nSumgait. At that time they had even turned the drunk tank into solitary \nconfinement.\n\nThus far I have identified 31 of the people who were in our apartment. Mamma \nidentified three, and Karina, two. The total is 36. Marina didn't identify \nanyone, she remembers the faces of two or three, But they weren't among the \nphotographs of those detained. I told of the neighbor I recognized. The one \nwho went after the axe. He still hasn't been detained, he's still on the \nloose. He's gone, and it's not clear if he will be found or not. I don't know \nhis first or last name. I know which building he lived in and I know his \nsisters' faces. But he's not in the city. The investigators informed me that \neven if the investigation is closed and even if the trial is over they will \ncontinue looking for him.\n\nThe 31 people I identified are largely blue-collar workers from various \nplants, without education, and of the very lowest level in every respect.\nMostly their ages range from 20 to 30 years; there was one who was 48. Only\none of them was a student. He was attending the Azerbaijan Petroleum and\nChemical Institute in Sumgait, his mother kept trying to bribe the investiga-\ntor. Once, thinking that I was an employee and not a victim, she said in front\nof me \"I'll set you up a restaurant worth 500 rubles and give you 600 in cash\nsimply for keeping him out of Armenia,\" that is, to keep him from landing in\na prison on Armenian soil. They're all terribly afraid of that, because if the\ninvestigator is talking with a criminal and the criminal doesn't confess even\nthough we identified him, they tell him--in order to apply psychological\npressure--they say, \"Fine, don't confess, just keep silent. When you're in an\nArmenian prison, when they find out who you are, they'll take care of you\nin short order.\" That somehow gets to them. Many give in and start to talk.\n\nThe investigators and I were in our apartment and videotaped the entire\npogrom of our apartment, as an investigative experiment. It was only then\nthat I saw the way they had left our apartment. Even without knowing who was \nin our apartment, you could guess. They stole, for example, all the money and \nall the valuables, but didn't take a single book. They tore them up, burned \nthem, poured water on them, and hacked them with axes. Only the Materials\nfrom the 27th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and James \nFenimore Cooper's Last of the Mohigans. Oh yes, lunch was ready, we were \nboiling a chicken, and there were lemons for tea on the table. After they had \nbeen in our apartment, both the chicken and the lemons were gone. That's \nenough to tell you what kind of people were in our apartment, people who don't\neven know anything about books. They didn't take a single book, but they did \ntake worn clothing, food, and even the cheapest of the cheap, worn-out \nslippers.\n\nOf those whom I identified, four were Kafan Azerbaijanis living in Sumgait. \nBasically, the group that went seeking \"revenge\"--let's use their word for \nit--was joined by people seeking easy gain and thrill-seekers. I talked with \none of them. He had gray eyes, and somehow against the back-drop of all that \nblack I remembered him specifically because of his of his eyes. Besides taking\npart in the pogrom of our apartment, he was also involved in the murder of \nTamara Mekhtiyeva from Building 16. She was an older Armenian who had recently\narrived from Georgia, she lived alone and did not have anyone in Sumgait. I \ndon't know why she had a last name like that, maybe she was married to an \nAzerbaijani. I had laid eyes on this woman only once or twice, and know \nnothing about her. I do know that they murdered her in her apartment with an \naxe. Murdering her wasn't enough for them. They hacked her into pieces and \nthrew them into the tub with water.\n\nI remember another guy really well too, he was also rather fair-skinned. You \nknow, all the people who were in our apartment were darker than dark, both \ntheir hair and their skin. And in contrast with them, in addition to the grey-\neyed one, I remember this one fellow, the one l took to be a Lezgin. I \nidentified him. As it turned out he was Eduard Robertovich Grigorian, born\nin the city of Sumgait, and he had been convicted twice. One of our own. How \ndid I remember him? The name Rita was tattooed on his left or right hand. I \nkept thinking, is that Rita or \"puma,\" which it would be if you read the word \nas Latin characters instead of Cyrillic, because the Cyrillic \"T\" was the one \nthat looks like a Latin \"M.\" When they led him in he sat with his hands behind\nhis back. This was at the confrontation. He swore on every holy book, tried to\nput in an Armenian word here and there to try and spark my compassion, and \ntold me that I was making a mistake, and called me \"dear sister.\" He said, \n\"You're wrong, how could I, an Armenian, raise my hand against my own, an \nArmenian,\" and so on. He spoke so convincingly that even the investigator \nasked me, \"Lyuda, are you sure it was he?\" I told him, \"I'll tell you one more\nidentifying mark. If I'm wrong I shall apologize and say I was mistaken. The \nname Rita is tattooed on his left or right hand.\" He went rigid and became \npale. They told him, \"Put your hands on the table.\" He put his hands on the\ntable with the palms up. I said, \"Now turn your hands over,\" but he didn't \nturn his hands over. Now this infuriated me. If he had from the very start\nacknowledged his guilt and said that he hadn't wanted to do it, that they \nforced him or something else, I would have treated him somewhat differently.\nBut he insolently stuck to his story, \"No, I did not do anything, it wasn't \nme.\" When they turned his hands over the name Rita was in fact tattooed on his\nhand. His face distorted and he whispered something wicked. I immediately flew\ninto a rage. There was an ashtray on the table, a really heavy one, made out \nof granite or something, very large, and it had ashes and butts in it. \nCatching myself quite by surprise, I hurled that ashtray at him. But he ducked\nand the ashtray hit the wall, and ashes and butts rained down on his head and \nback. And he smiled. When he smiled it provoked me further. I don't know how, \nbut I jumped over the table between us and started either pounding him or \nstrangling him; I no longer remember which. When I jumped I caught the \nmicrophone cord. The investigator was there, Tolya . . .I no longer recall his\nlast name, and he says, \"Lyudochka, it's a Japanese microphone! Please . . .\n\" And shut off all the equipment on the spot, it was all being video taped. \nThey took him away. I stayed, and they talked to me a little to calm me down, \nbecause we needed to go on working, I only remember Tolya telling me, \"You're \nsome actress! What a performance!\" I said, \"Tolya, honestly . . . \" Beforehand\nthey would always tell me, \"Lyuda, more emotion. You speak as calmly as if \nnothing had happened to you.\" I say, \"I don't have any more strength or \nemotion. All my emotions are behind me now, I no longer have the strength \n. . . I don't have the strength to do anything.\" And he says, \"Lyuda, how were\nyou able to do that?\" And when I returned to normal, drinking tea and watching\nthe tape, I said, \"Can I really have jumped over that table? I never jumped \nthat high in gym class.\"\n\nSo you could say the gang that took over our apartment was international. Of \nthe 36 we identified there was an Armenian, a Russian, Vadim Vorobyev, who \nbeat Mamma, and 34 Azerbaijanis.\n\nAt the second meeting with Grigorian, when he had completely confessed his \nguilt, he told of how on February 27 the Azerbaijanis had come knocking. Among\nthem were guys--if you can call them guys--he knew from prison. They said, \n\"Tomorrow we're going after the Armenians. Meet us at the bus station at three\no'clock.\" He said, \"No, I'm not coming.\" They told him, \"If you don't come \nwe'll kill you.\" He said, \"Alright, I'll come.\" And he went.\n\nThey also went to visit my classmate from our microdistrict, Kamo Pogosian. He\nhad also been in prison; I think that together they had either stolen a \nmotorcycle or dismantled one to get some parts they needed. They called him \nout of his apartment and told him the same thing: \"Tomorrow we're going to get\nthe Armenians. Be there.\" He said, \"No.\" They pulled a knife on him. He said, \n\"I'm not going all the same.\" And in the courtyard on the 27th they stabbed \nhim several times, in the stomach. He was taken to the hospital. I know he was\nin the hospital in Baku, in the Republic hospital. If we had known about that \nwe would have had some idea of what was to come on the 28th.\n\nI'll return to Grigorian, what he did in our apartment. I remember that he\nbeat me along with all the rest. He spoke Azerbaijani extremely well. But he\nwas very fair-skinned, maybe that led me to think that they had it out for\nhim, too. But later it was proved that he took part in the beating and burning\nof Shagen Sargisian. I don't know if he participated in the rapes in our \napartment; I didn't see, I don't remember. But the people who were in our \napartment who didn't yet know that he was an Armenian said that he did. I \ndon't know if he confessed or not, and I myself don't recall because I blacked\nout very often. But I think that he didn't participate in the rape of Karina\nbecause he was in the apartment the whole time. When they carried her into the\ncourtyard, he remained in the apartment.\n\nAt one point I was talking with an acquaintance about Edik Grigorian. From her\nI learned that his wife was a dressmaker, his mother is Russian, he doesn't \nhave a father, and that he's been convicted twice. Well this will be his third\nand, I hope, last sentence. He beat his wife, she was eternally coming to work\nwith bruises. His wife was an Armenian by the name of Rita.\n\nThe others who were detained . . . well they're little beasts. You really can't\ncall them beasts, they're just little beasts. They were robots carrying out\nsomeone else's will, because at the investigation they all said, \"I don't \nunderstand how I could have done that, I was out of my head.\" But we know that\nthey were won around to it and prepared for it, that's why they did it. In the\nname of Allah, in the name of the Koran, in the name of propagating Islam--\nthat's holy to them--that's why they did everything they were commanded to do.\nBecause I saw they didn't have minds of their own, I'm not talking about their\nlevel of cultural sophistication or any higher values. No education, they\nwork, have a slew of children without the means to raise them properly, they \ncrowd them in, like at the temporary housing, and apparently, they were \npromised that if they slaughtered the Armenians they would receive apartments.\nSo off they went. Many of them explained their participation saying, \"they \npromised us apartments.\"\n\nAmong them was one who genuinely repented. I am sure that he repented from the\nheart and that he just despised himself after the incident. He worked at a \nchildren's home, an Azerbaijani, he has two children, and his wife works at \nthe children's home too. Everything that they acquired, everything that they \nhave they earned by their own labor, and wasn't inherited from parents or \ngrandparents. And he said, \"I didn't need anything I just don't know . . . how\nI ended up in that; it was like some hand was guiding me. I had no will of my \nown, I had no strength, no masculine dignity, nothing.\" And the whole time I\nkept repeating, \"Now you imagine that someone did the same to your young wife \nright before your own eyes.\" He sat there and just wailed.\n\nBut that leader in the Eskimo dogskin coat was not detained. He performed a \nmarvelous disappearing act, but I think that they'll get onto him, they just \nhave to work a little, because that Vadim, that boy, according to his\ngrandfather, is in touch with the young person who taught him what to do, how \nto cover his tracks. He was constantly exchanging jackets with other boys he \nknew and those he didn't, either, and other things as well, and changed \nhimself like a chameleon so they wouldn't get onto him, but he was detained.\n\nThat one in the Eskimo dogskin coat was at the Gambarians' after Aleksandr \nGambarian was murdered. He came in and said, \"Let's go, enough, you've spilled\nenough blood here.\"\n\nMaybe Karina doesn't know this but the reason they didn't finish her off was \nthat they were hoping to take her home with them. I heard this from Aunt Tanya\nand her sons, the Kasumovs, who were in the courtyard near the entryway. They \nliked her very much, and they had decided to take her to home with them. When \nKarina came to at one point--she doesn't remember this yet, this the neighbors \nold me--and she saw that there was no one around her, she started crawling to \nthe entryway. They saw that she was still alive and came back, they were \nalready at the third entryway, on their way to the Gambarians'. They came back\nand started beating her to finish her. If she had not come to she would have \nsustained lesser bodily injuries, they would have beat her less. An older \nwoman from our building, Aunt Nazan, an Azerbaijani, all but lay on top of \nKarina, crying and pleading that they leave her alone, but they flung her off.\nThe woman's grown sons were right nearby; they picked her up in their hands \nand led her home. She howled and cried out loudly and swore: God is on Earth, \nhe sees everything, and He won't forgive this.\n\nThere was another woman, too, Aunt Fatima, a sick, aging woman from the first \nfloor, she's already retired. Mountain dwellers, and Azerbaijanis, too, have a\ncustom: If men are fighting, they throw a scarf under their feet to stop them.\nBut they trampled her scarf and sent her home. To trample a scarf is \ntantamount to trampling a woman's honor.\n\nNow that the investigation is going on, now that a lot is behind us and we \nhave gotten back to being ourselves a little, I think about how could these \nevents that are now called the Sumgait tragedy happen? How did they come \nabout? How did it start? Could it have been avoided? Well, it's clear that \nwithout a signal, without permission from the top leadership, it would not \nhave happened. All the same, I'm not afraid to say this, the Azerbaijanis,\nlet other worthy people take no offense, the better representatives of their \nnations, let them take no offense, but the Azerbaijanis in their majority are \na people who are kept in line only by fear of the law, fear of retribution for\nwhat they have done. And when the law said that they could do all that, like\nunleashed dogs who were afraid they wouldn't have time to do everything, they \nthrew themselves from one thing to the next so as to be able to get more done,\nto snatch a bit more. The smell of the danger was already in the air on\nFebruary 27. You could tell that something was going to happen. And everyone \nwho had figured it out took steps to avoid running into those gangs. Many left\nfor their dachas, got plane tickets for the other end of the country, just got\nas far away as their legs would carry them.\n\nFebruary 27 was a Saturday. I was teaching my third class. The director came \ninto my classroom and said that I should let the children out, that there had \nbeen a call from the City Party Committee asking that all teachers gather for \na meeting at Lenin Square. Well, I excused the children, and there were few \nteachers left at school, altogether three women, the director, and six or \nseven men. The rest had already gone home. We got to Lenin Square and there \nwere a great many people there. This was around five-thirty or six in the \nevening, no later. They were saying all kinds of rubbish up on the podium and \nthe crowd below was supporting them stormily, roaring. They spoke over the \nmicrophone about what had happened in Kafan a few days earlier and that the \ndriver of a bus going to some district had recently thrown a small Azerbaijani\nchild off the bus. The speaker affirmed that he was an eyewitness, that he had\nseen it himself..The crowd started to rage: \"Death to the Armenians! They must\nbe killed!\" Then a woman went up on stage. I didn't see the woman because \npeople were clinging to the podium like flies. I could only hear her. The \nwoman introduced herself as coming from Kafan, and said that the Armenians \ncut her daughters' breasts off, and called, \"Sons, avenge my daughters!\" That \nwas enough. A portion of the people on the square took off running in the \ndirection of the factories, toward the beginning of Lenin Street.\n\nWe stood there about an hour. Then the director of School 25 spoke, he gave a \nvery nationalist speech. He said, \"Brother Muslims, kill the Armenians!\" This \nhe repeated every other sentence. When he said this the crowd supported him \nstormily, whistling and shouting \"Karabagh!\" He said, \"Karabagh has been our \nterritory my whole life long, Karabagh is my soul. How can you tear out my \nheart?\" As though an Azerbaijani would die without Karabagh. \"It's our \nterritory, the Armenians will never see it. The Armenians must be eliminated. \nFrom time immemorial Muslims have cleansed the land of infidel Armenians, from\ntime immemorial, that's the way nature created it, that every 20 to 30 years \nthe Azerbaijanis should cleanse the land of filth.\" By filth he meant \nArmenians.\n\nI heard this. Before that I hadn't been listening to the speeches closely.\nMany people spoke and I stood with my back to the podium, talking shop with \nthe other teachers, and somehow it all went right by, it didn't penetrate,\nthat in fact something serious was taking place. Then, when one of our\nteachers said, \"Listen to what he's saying, listen to what idiocy he's \nspouting,\" we listened. That was the speech of that director. Before that we \nlistened to the woman's speech.\n\nRight then in our group--there were nine of us--the mood changed, and the \nsubject of conversation and all school matters were forgotten. Our director of\nstudies, for whom I had great respect, he's an Azerbaijani . . . Before that I\nhad considered him an upstanding and worthy person, if there was a need to \nobtain leave we had asked him, he seemed like a good person. So he tells me,\n\"Lyuda, you know that besides you there are no Armenians on the square? If \nthey find out that you're an Armenian they'll tear you to pieces. Should I \ntell them you're an Armenian? Should I tell them you're an Armenian?\" When he \nsaid it the first time I pretended not to hear it, and then he asked me a \nsecond time. I turned to the director, Khudurova, and said that it was already\nafter eight, I was expected at home, and I should be leaving. She answered, \n\"No, they said that women should stay here until ten o'clock,.and men, until \ntwelve. Stay here.\" There was a young teacher with us, her children were in \nkindergarten and her husband worked shifts. She asked to leave: \"I left my \nchildren at the kindergarten.\" The director excused her. When she let her go I\nturned around, said, \"Good-bye,\" and left with the young teacher, the \nAzerbaijani. I didn't see them after that.\n\nWhen we were walking the buses weren't running, and a crowd from the rally ran\nnearby us. They had apparently gotten all fired up. It must have become too \nmuch for them, and they wanted to seek vengeance immediately, so they rushed \noff. I wasn't afraid this time because I was sure that the other teacher \nwouldn't say that I was an Armenian.\n\nTo make it short, we reached home. Then Karina told of how they had been at \nthe movies and what had happened there. I started telling of my experience and\nagain my parents didn't understand that we were in danger. We watched \ntelevision as usual, and didn't even imagine that tomorrow would be our last \nday. That's how it all was.\n\nAt the City Party Committee I met an acquaintance, we went to school together,\nZhanna, I don't remember her last name, she lives above the housewares store \non Narimanov Street. She was there with her father, for some reason she \ndoesn't have a mother. The two of them were at home alone. While her father \nheld the door she jumped from the third floor, and she was lucky that the \nground was wet and that there wasn't anyone behind the building when she went \nout on the balcony, there was no one there, they were all standing near the \nentryway. That building was also a lucky one in that there were no murders \nthere. She jumped. She jumped and didn't feel any pain in the heat of the \nmoment. A few days later I found out that she couldn't stand up, she had been \ninjured somehow. That's how people in Sumgait saved their lives, their honor, \nand their children: any way they could. \n\nWhere it was possible, the Armenians fought back. My father's first cousin, \nArmen M., lives in Block 30. They found out by phone from one of the victims \nwhat was going on in town. The Armenians in that building all called one \nanother immediately and all of them armed themselves with axes, knives, even \nwith muskets and went up to the roof. They took their infants with them, and \ntheir old women who had been in bed for God knows how many months, they got \nthem right out of their beds and took everyone upstairs. They hooked \nelectricity up to the trap door to the roof and waited, ready to fight. Then \nthey took the daughter of the school board director hostage, she's an \nAzerbaijani who lived in their building. They called the school board director\nand told her that if she didn't help them, the 17 Armenians on the roof, to \nescape alive and unharmed, she'd never see her daughter again. I'm sure, of \ncourse, that Armenians would never lay a hand on a woman, it was just the only\nthing that could have saved them at the time. She called the police. The \nArmenians made a deal with the local police to go into town. Two armored \npersonnel carriers and soldiers were summoned They surrounded the entryway and\nled everyone down from the roof, and off to the side from the armored \npersonnel carriers was a crowd that was on its way to the building at that \nvery moment, into Block 30. That's how they defended themselves.\n\nI heard that our neighbors, Roman and Sasha Gambarian, resisted. They're big, \nstrong guys. Their father was killed. And I heard that the brothers put up a \nstrong defense and lost their father, but were able to save their mother.\n\nOne of the neighbors told me that after it happened, when they were looking \nfor the criminals on March 1 to 2 and detaining everyone they suspected, \npeople hid people in our entryway, maybe people who were injured or perhaps \ndead. The neighbors themselves were afraid to go there, and when they went \nwith the soldiers into our basement they are supposed to have found \nAzerbaijani corpses. I don't know how many. Even if they had been wounded and \nput down there, after two days they would have died from loss of blood or \ninfection--that basement was filled with water. I heard this from the \nneighbors. And later when I was talking with the investigators the subject \ncame up and they confirmed it. I know, too, that for several hours the \nbasement was used to store objects stolen from our apartment. And our neighbor\ncarried out our carpet, along with the rest: he stole it for himself, posing \nas one of the criminals. Everyone was taking his own share, and the neighbor \ntook his, too, and carried it home. And when we came back, when everything \nseemed to have calmed down, he returned it, saying that it was the only thing \nof ours he had managed to \"save.\"\n\nRaya's husband and father defended themselves. The Trdatovs defended \nthemselves, and so did other Armenian families. To be sure there were\nAzerbaijani victims, although we'll never hear anything about them. For some \nreason our government doesn't want to say that the Armenians were not just \nvictims, but that they defended the honor of their sisters and mothers, too. \nIn the TV show \"Pozitsiya\" [Viewpoint] a military man, an officer, said that \nthe Armenians did virtually nothing to defend themselves. But that's not \nimportant, the truth will come out regardless.\n\nSo that's the price we paid those three days. For three days our courage, our \nbravery, and our humanity was tested. It was those three days, and not the \nyears and dozens of years we had lived before them, that showed what we've \nbecome, what we grew up to be. Those three days showed who was who.\n\nOn that I will conclude my narrative on the Sumgait tragedy. It should be said\nthat it's not over yet, the trials are still ahead of us, and the punishments\nreceived by those who so violated us, who wanted to make us into nonhumans \nwill depend on our position and on the work of the investigators, the \nProcuracy, and literally of every person who lent his hand to the investiga-\ntion. That's the price we paid to live in Armenia, to not fear going out on \nthe street at night, to not be afraid to say we're Armenians, and to not fear\nspeaking our native tongue.\n\n   October 15,1988\n   Yerevan\n\n\t\t\t- - - reference for #008 - - -\n\n[1] _The Sumgait Tragedy; Pogroms against Armenians in Soviet Azerbaijan,\n    Volume I, Eyewitness Accounts_, edited by Samuel Shahmuradian, forward by\n    Yelena Bonner, 1990, published by Aristide D.

In order to \npurchase and use the big rocket motors required, it is necessary to be\none of the following:\na) An employee of a government agency.\nb) An employee or student at a university doing research involving rockets.\nc) A member or representative of an educational organization involved in\nresearch or other uses of rockets. There are two such organizations: \nThe Tripoli Rocketry Association and the National Association of Rocketry.\nMembers of either organization must demonstrate proficiency in construction\nand flight before they are allowed to purchase large motors on their own.\n\nThe FAA will issue a waiver of its regulations, upon request, to any \norganization which can persuade them it has taken adequate precautions \nto avoid conflicts with aircraft. The usual stipulations are:\n- Only operation up to a specified ceiling is allowed. Depending on the\nlocation, this ceiling may be from 5000 to 50000 feet AGL. \n- The operator of the rocket is responsible for avoiding any aircraft\nwithin the operating radius around the launch site.\n- Flight into clouds or beyond visual range in haze is expressly prohibited.\n- The FAA will provide a NOTAM informing other users of the airspace that\nunmanned rocket operations are taking place at the specified place and time.\n\nMost of the launches that are held (and there are dozens of them every year)\nare held in areas where air traffic is relatively light, such as over the\nwestern deserts (the Black Rock Desert north of Reno is particularly popular\nsince it is 25 x 150 miles of *nothing to hit* on the ground).\n\nThe two rocketry associations test and approve motors for their members'\nuse, to insure safety. Depending on motor size, the launcher setback is\nfrom 50 to 500 or more feet. \n\nBy the way, rockets under 1 lb and powered by an \"F\" motor are exempt from\nmost Federal regulations on unmanned rockets anyway. See FAR 101, Subpart\nC, for details.\n\nAs for recovery...although the higher altitude rockets can reach up to\n50,000 feet, most of them only get to 2,000 to 5,000 feet. The typical\nrocket is 2 to 6 inches in diameter, and carries a 3 to 6 foot parachute,\nor multiple parachutes, depending on the payload. Many rockets also carry\neither a small transmitter or an audio sounder--particularly at launches\nin the eastern US, where there are more obstructions.\n\nCamera, telemetry transmitter, and video payloads are becoming quite common.\n\n\nWhy not? It's a lot of fun...check out the traffic on rec.models.rockets\nfor information about the model (3 lb and under) and high power (everything\nbigger) rocket hobbies. As with all dangerous activities, the key is to\npractice safety. I've been flying consumer rockets ranging up to 4-5 lbs\ntakeoff weight for 27 years, and still have all my extremities intact.\n\n\nThat's another thing. NO EXPLOSIVE WARHEADS OF ANY KIND ARE ALLOWED ON THESE\nROCKETS. NONE! Please forgive me for shouting, but that's one of the biggest\nmisconceptions people have about our hobby. \n\nTrue. But it will not be related to the rocket hobby, unless I get \nhit while crossing a road with a rocket in my hand. ","label":"sci.space"}

{"text":"Classify the following data: This was posted to the firearms-politics mailing list.\n=============================================================\nHi Folks;\n\nThursday, April 15 marked Day 3 of the trial.\n\nThis day marked the first testimony of the trial.  Deputy\nU.S. Marshal Larry Cooper took the stand for the prosecution.\n\nThe short version is that his testimony was consistent with\nthe opening statements for the prosecution.\n\nCooper testified that he had arrived in Spokane (Washington)\non August 17, 1992 to participate in a surveillance operation\nwith five other deputies near the Weaver cabin.  The team was\nusing night vision equipment for surveillance, and split up\ninto two teams of three people.  The six later met at an\nobservation point above the cabin.  After this, deputies\nCooper, William Degan, and Arthur Roderick began a descent to\nscout further possible surveillance sites.\n\nCooper told the court that Roderick threw two large rocks into\na gully to see, \"whether the [Weaver family] dogs would respond.\"\nStriker, the Weaver's yellow lab, started toward them barking\nloudly.  Roderick led the three in a run from the area.\n\nThey ran through some dense woods into an open area [called the\n\"fern field\"] with the dog in pursuit.  By this time, Kevin\nHarris and Samuel Weaver had joined the chase.  The surveillance\nteam had reached a Y in the road: Cooper decided that they should\ntake cover in the woods because otherwise they would be an easy\ntarget and might be \"shot in the back.\"\n\nAs Degan reached the Y, he spotted Randy Weaver coming down the\nroad from the cabin ahead.  Weaver was startled but did not fire.\n\nAt this moment, Striker reached Degan, and Cooper had to \"fend\nhim off with his gun.\"  [It is unclear whether this means he\nclubbed the dog or shot the dog].  Both Cooper and Degan then\ntook cover in the woods.  According to Cooper, Kevin Harris and\nSamuel Weaver continued walking down the road, apparently not\nnoticing the two.  After they had passed by on the road, Degan\ngot up on one knee, raised his gun, and shouted, \"Stop!  U.S.\nMarshal!\"  Harris then \"...brought the weapon around at hip level\nand fired.  He didn't bring the weapon up to eye level.  I saw\nBill's arm going back, and I knew he had been hit.\"  Cooper fired\nat Harris, and Harris went down.  Cooper then brought his weapon\nto bear on Samuel, but did not fire.  At this point, Cooper then\nheard two shots to his right.  Samuel Weaver looked in the\ndirection of the shots, yelled, \"You son of a bitch!\" and ran\ntoward them.  Cooper then realized that shots were coming at him\nfrom directly ahead, so he fired a three-round burst at the\ncabin.  At this point he then saw Samuel Weaver running toward\nthe cabin.  When Cooper reached Degan, he placed his first two\nfingers on Degan carotid artery, counted two or three beats, and\nthen his heart stopped.  Shortly thereafter, Roderick and the\nother three marshals joined him.  They then all heard a large\nburst of gunfire from the area around the cabin.\n\nOn cross-examination, David Nevin questioned the point of\nthrowing rocks into the gulley, asking, \"You wanted to lure that\ndog out so you could shoot that dog, didn't you?\"  Nevin also\npointed out that in last September's testimony, Cooper had\nclaimed that he spotted Weaver after the dog had left him.\nCooper claimed that he had gone over the events in his head and\ndecided that Thursday's account was correct.  Nevin continued the\ncross-examination by asking what Cooper would have done had an\narmed man dressed in full camouflage jumped out of the woods at\nhim [no answer was available].\n\nFriday, April 16 marks continued cross-examination of Cooper.\n\nNotes: There was no coverage of protestors.\n\nDrew\n==============================================================\n","label":"talk.politics.guns"}

One of my relatives, a L.A. resident, hired a car\nat the Nuernberg airport and went about 18 miles to our home. He said then that\nhe grew about 1 year older during this ride and swore he'd never drive a car in\nGermany again (this was in 1982 and he kept his promise - the situation now is\neven worse as effect of the increased volume of traffic).\nWhat you mean by `better disciplined' should perhaps be considered `cautious due\nto fear': \nWhen driving around here, you always *have* to take into consideration that the\nmajority of the other drivers absolutely relies on you: They expect that nobody\nfails or sleeps; many of them exploit this by driving as fast as their car can\ngo (of course only where that is allowed, you might think - dream on :).\nSo any mistake you make is a very high risk to your health - and if you're ex-\nposed to such a situation from your very first day as a driver, you learn to\nhandle it - or you lose... \nThat's the way I and most people I know experience our traffic situation - \nwhether you think this is pleasant or efficient is up to you; I think we handle\na very high volume of traffic and that at high speeds with modest (compared to\nthe volume) and decreasing rates of lethal accidents - OTOH, more and more\npeople (esp. women) dislike driving (because they feel overtaxed and threatened)\nand each accident is one accident too much.\n\n\nBetter designed and maintained, may be - but animal fences are very rare. Auto-\nbahnen and many other streets have guard-rails (I hope that's the right word - \na plank made from thick steel sheet fixed on uprights; it's about 2 feet high);\nthose guard-rails are designed for keeping vehicles on the road. Smaller animals\ncan crawl under the plank, bigger ones can easily jump over it. The point is\nthat esp. larger animals are very rare in Germany; they tend also to be very\ntimid. Accidents caused by animals are a neglegible danger.\n\n\nYou're right (there are speed linits even on the major part of the Autobahn) -\nbut the attitude towards driving (see above) seems to be very similar to that\nin Germany (I've been in France, Switzerland, Italy, Austria, Spain, Belgium,\nthe Netherlands) - besides that, you really can't rely on the residents abiding\nthe local speed limits. I've got quite a lot of practise (~120k miles) and I'm\nused to travel at 130 mph (FYI, with a car even smaller than a rabbit), but I\nconsider driving on the highways round Paris or Milano really a thrill...\n\n\nSorry, but you'll find quite a lot rabbit-class-car (or even smaller, mine is a\nPeugeot 205) owners going that fast; small cars with much HP are very `hip' over\nhere - and most people buying such cars aren't afraid to let them run.\n\n\nI disagree; the size or weight of a car is rather irrelevant. Formula-1 cars\nweigh less than 700 kg and the drivers have a chance to survive accidents at\n130 mph or higher - OTOH when crashing against a solid object at 130 mph,\nit makes no difference whether you sit in a Porsche, a Mercedes, a tank or on\na bicycle: Your're dead.\n\nBye,\nStefan\n---\nStefan Dalibor (dalibor@immd3.uni-erlangen.de)","label":"rec.autos"}

{"text":"Classify the following data: The following was posted and no doubt retyped by Yigal Ahrens and considering \n the importance of the issue and the almost total blackout except in \n California, I am reposting to other appropriates groups.\n \n \n \n From LA Times, Friday, April 9, 1993.  P. A1.\n \n EVIDENCE OF ADL SPY OPERATION SEIZED BY POLICE\n \n By Richard C. Paddock, Times staff writer\n \n SAN FRANCISCO -- Police on Thursday served search warrants on the\n Anti-Defamation League here and in Los Angeles, seizing evidence of a\n nationwide intelligence network accused of keeping files on more than\n 950 political groups, newspapers and labor unions and as many as\n 12,000 people.\n \n Describing the spy operation in great detail, San Francisco\n authorities simultaneously released voluminous documents telling how\n operatives of the Anti-Defamation League searched through trash and\n infiltrated organizations to gather intelligence on Arab-American,\n right-wing and what they called \"pinko\" organizations.\n \n Representatives of the Anti-Defamation League, a well-known\n organization in the U.S. Jewish community dedicated to fighting\n anti-Semitism, declined detailed comment Thursday but denied breaking\n any laws.\n \n Police allege that the organization maintains undercover operatives to\n gather political intelligence in at least seven cities, including Los\n Angeles and San Francisco.\n \n Groups that were the focus of the spy operation span the political\n spectrum, including such groups as the Ku Klux Klan, the White Aryan\n Resistance, Operation Rescue, Greenpeace, the National Assn. for the\n Advancement of Colored People, the United Farm Workers and the Jewish\n Defense League.  Also on the list were Mills College, the board of\n directors of San Francisco public television station KQED and the San\n Francisco Bay Guardian newspaper.\n \n People who were subjects of the spy operation included former\n Republican Rep. Pete McCloskey, jailed political extremist Lyndon H.\n LaRouche and Los Angeles Times foreign correspondent Scott Kraft, who\n is based in South Africa.\n \n Authorities said much of the material collected by the groups was\n confidential information obtained illegally from law enforcement\n agencies.  They also alleged that data on some individuals and\n organizations was sold separately to the South African government.\n \n In addition to allegations of obtaining confidential information from\n police, the Anti-Defamation League could face a total of 48 felony\n counts for not properly reporting the employment of its chief West\n Coast spy, Roy Bullock, according to the affidavit filed to justify\n the search warrant.\n \n The Anti-Defamation League disguised payments to Bullock for more than\n 25 years by funneling $550 a week to Beverly Hills attorney Bruce I.\n Hochman, who then paid Bullock, according to the documents released in\n San Francisco.  Hochman, a former president of the Jewish Federation\n Council of Greater Los Angeles and one of the state's leading tax\n attorneys, will be out of the city until late next week and could not\n be reached for comment, his office said.\n \n Until 1990, Hochman, a former U.S. prosecutor, also was a member of a\n panel appointed by then-Sen. Pete Wilson to secretly make initial\n recommendations on new federal judges in California.  Hochman is a\n former regional president of the Anti-Defamation League.\n \n The league, which initially cooperated with police, has denied\n repeatedly that its intelligence-gathering operation broke any laws.\n League officials will not confirm or deny whether Bullock was an\n employee and have said they simply traded information with police\n departments about people who might be involved in hate crimes.\n \n But in an affidavit filed to obtain warrants for Thursday's searches,\n San Francisco police alleged that \"ADL employees were apparently less\n than truthful\" in providing information during an earlier search\n conducted without a warrant.\n \n David Lehrer, executive director of the Los Angeles ADL office, said\n the organization has not violated the law.  \"There is nothing\n nefarious about how we operate or what we have done,\" he said.  \"Our\n record speaks for itself.\"\n \n The police affidavit contends that Lehrer had sole control of a secret\n fund used to pay for \"fact-finding operations.\"  Lehrer, according to\n the documents, signed checks from the account under the name L.\n Patterson.\n \n An ADL official said the account was used to pay for subscriptions to\n a wide variety of extremist publications that might balk at sending\n them directly to the Anti-Defamation League.\n \n Bullock, 58, who has been collecting intelligence for the ADL for\n nearly 40 years, defended his efforts during a lengthy interview with\n San Francisco police.  He said that he gathered names from many\n sources and entered them into his computer under headings such as\n \"Skins\" and \"Pinkos,\" but that did not necessarily mean that they were\n under surveillance.\n \n \"I might never see or call up on 99% of them again,\" Bullock said.\n \"And it doesn't mean anything that they're in the files.  It's not a\n threat to anyone's civil rights that a name appears in my files under,\n say, 'Pinko.'\"\n \n In recent years, Bullock worked closely with San Francisco Police\n Officer Tom Gerard, who fled to the Phillippines last fall after he\n was questioned by the FBI in the case.\n \n A former CIA employee, Gerard supplied Bullock with criminal records\n and Department of Motor Vehicles information such as home addresses,\n vehicle registration, physical characteristics and drivers license\n photographs.\n \n Using files gathered for the Anti-Defamation League, Gerard and\n Bullock also provided information to the South African government,\n receiving $16,000 over four years, the documents show.\n \n The file on Times staff writer Kraft, which was apparently sold to the\n South African government, provides some insight into the hit-and-miss\n nature of the spy operation.\n \n The file notes that Kraft's articles \"appear frequently in The Times\n and are well researched and written,\" but little else about the file\n is accurate.  The brief entry confuses The Times' Kraft with another\n Scott Kraft and provides the South African government with the wrong\n Kraft's physical description, photograph and other personal\n information.\n \n Nevertheless, the documents provide illuminating details of how\n Bullock for decades infiltrated all manner of organizations, from\n skinheads to left-wing radicals, searching regularly through the trash\n of target groups.  Using Anti-Defamation League funds, he also ran his\n own paid informants under code names such as \"Scott\" and \"Scumbag.\"\n \n He worked closely with police officers up and down the coast,\n exchanged information with the FBI and worked with federal agencies,\n including the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms.\n \n It was Bullock's work as a paid informant for the FBI -- while spying\n on behalf of the Anti-Defamation League and the South African\n government -- that proved his undoing. The FBI learned that he was an\n agent of a foreign government and began investigating, leading to the\n probe of the Anti-Defamation League's intelligence network.  The\n Anti-Defamation League employed undercover operatives to gather\n information in Los Angeles, San Francisco, New York, Washington,\n Chicago, St. Louis and Atlanta, according to the affidavit and\n investigators.  Joining San Francisco police in searching league\n offices and a Los Angeles bank were investigators from the office of\n San Francisco Dist. Atty. Arlo Smith and the state Franchise Tax\n Board.  The Los Angeles Police Department, which earlier refused to\n cooperate with the investigation, was informed of the searches in Los\n Angeles but not invited to participate.  Investigators suspect that\n some confidential information in the Anti-Defamation League files may\n have come from Los Angeles police officers.\n \n \n \n From Los Angeles Times, Saturday, April 10, 1993.  P. A23.\n \n ADL VOWS TO COOPERATE WITH SPY INVESTIGATION\n \n By Richard C. Paddock, Times staff writer.\n \n SAN FRANCISCO -- The Anti-Defamation League defended its record as a\n civil rights group Friday and said it will cooperate with authorities\n who are investigating whether the organization collected confidential\n police information on citizens and groups.\n \n But San Francisco Dist. Atty. Arlo Smith said that Anti-Defamation\n League employees involved in intelligence gathering could face many\n felony counts of receiving confidential files, eavesdropping, tax\n violations and conspiracy.\n \n Police have accused the Anti-Defamation League of not being truthful\n about its spying operations, which collected information on more than\n 12,000 individuals and 950 political groups across the political\n spectrum.\n \n Hundreds of pages of documents released by prosecutors Thursday show\n that the ADL maintained a nationwide intelligence network and kept\n files on political figures.\n \n Even so, Smith suggested that if the Anti-Defamation League shut down\n its spy operation, prosecutors would take that into account when\n deciding what charges to file.\n \n In a statement released in Washington, National Director Abraham H.\n Foxman described the ADL as \"a Jewish defense agency which has fought\n to protect all minorities from bigotry and discrimination for 80\n years.\"\n \n Foxman said the organization is regarded as a credible source on\n extremist groups and has a tradition of routinely providing\n information to police, journalists, academics, government officials\n and the public.  It has never been the policy of the ADL to obtain\n information illegally, he said.\n \n \"Like other journalists, in order to protect the confidentiality and\n physical safety of its sources, ADL will not comment on the nature or\n identity of any source of information,\" Foxman said.\n \n The Anti-Defamation League refused to acknowledge that one of its\n longtime employees, Roy Bullock, was anything more than \"a private\n individual who is alleged to be an ADL 'informant.'\"\n \n Among the documents released by prosecutors were detailed statements\n showing how the ADL funneled weekly payments to Bullock through\n Beverly Hills attorney Bruce I. Hochman.\n \n \"Roy would penetrate organizations and needed this arrangement to be\n distanced from ADL,\" Hochman told a San Francisco police investigator.\n Hochman could not be reached Friday at his home or office for comment.\n \n Despite the Anti-Defamation League's assertion that it will cooperate\n with authorities, San Francisco police said the group did not turn\n over all pertinent documents during a voluntary search of the group's\n offices in Los Angeles and San Francisco last fall.\n \n A second round of searches Thursday, this time with search warrants,\n produced a vast quantity of records, primarily dealing with financial\n transactions, Smith said.  Further searches may be necessary and it\n will be at least a month before any charges are filed, he said.\n \n \"The investigation, of course, will go wherever the facts lead us,\"\n the district attorney said.","label":"talk.politics.misc"}

{"text":"Classify the following data: Archive-name: x-faq/part2\nLast-modified: 1993/04/04\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject:  24)! How do I make a screendump or print my application?\n\n\tThe xwd client in the X11 distributions can be used to select a window \nor the background. It produces an XWD-format file of the image of that window. \nThe file can be post-processed into something useful or printed with the xpr \nclient and your local printing mechanism. You can use this command:\n\t\tcsh% sleep 10; xwd -root > output.xwd &\nand then spend 10 seconds or so setting up your screen; the entire current\ndisplay will be saved into the file output.xwd. Note that xwd also has an\nundocumented (before R5) -id flag for specifying the window id on the \ncommand-line. [There are also unofficial patches on export to xwd for \nspecifying the delay and the portion of the screen to capture.]\n\n\tTwo publicly-available programs which allow interactive definition of \narbitrary portions of the display and built-in delays are asnap and xgrabsc.\nThere are several versions of xgrabsc; version 2.2, available on export [8/92]\nis the most recent.\n\txsnap includes some asnap features and supersedes it; it also renders \nXPM output [version unknown]. It is available on export or avahi.inria.fr;\nsee xsnap-pl2.tar.Z.\n\tA screen-dump and merge/edit program combining features of xwd and xpr\nis available from vernam.cs.uwm.edu as xdump1.0.tar.Z. Information: \nsoft-eng@cs.uwm.edu.\n\txprint, by Alberto Accomazzi (alberto@cfa.harvard.edu) is available\nfrom cfa0 (128.103.40.1) in xprint.export-2.1.tar.Z.\n\n\tTo post-process the xwd output of some of these tools, you can use xpr,\nwhich is part of the X11 distribution. Also on several archives are xwd2ps\nand XtoPS, which produce Encapsulated PostScript with trimmings suitable for \nuse in presentations (see export.lcs.mit.edu:contrib/xwd2ps.tar.Z and\ncontrib/ImageMagick.tar.Z). Also useful is the PBMPLUS package on many archive\nservers; and the Xim package contains Level 2 color PostScript output.\n\n\tThe XV program can grab a portion of the X display, manipulate it, and\nsave it in one of the available formats. ImageMagick has similar capabilities.\n\n\tAlso: \n\n\tBristol Technology (info@bristol.com, 203-438-6969) offers Xprinter \n2.0, an Xlib API for PostScript and PCL printers; a demo is on ftp.uu.net\nin vendor/Bristol/Xprinter.\n\n\tColorSoft 9619-459-8500) offers OPENprint package includes a screen-\ncapture facility, image-processing, and support for PostScript and \nnon-PostScript printers.\n\n\tSome vendors' implementations of X (e.g. DECWindows and OpenWindows) \ninclude session managers or other desktop programs which include \"print portion\nof screen\" or \"take a snapshot\" options. Some platforms also have tools which \ncan be used to grab the frame-buffer directly; the Sun systems, for example, \nhave a 'screendump' program which produces a Sun raster file. Some X terminals \nhave local screen-dump utilities to write PostScript to a local serial printer.\n\n\tSome vendors' implementations of lpr (e.g. Sony) include direct \nsupport for printing xwd files, but you'll typically need some other package \nto massage the output into a useful format which you can get to the printer.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject:  25)  How do I make a color PostScript screendump of the X display?\n\n\tIf you need color PostScript in particular, you can \n\t- grab the screen-image using a program which can produce color \nPostScript, such as xgrabsc and xv \n\t- grab the screen-image using xwd and post-process xwd into color PS.\nYou can do this using xwd2ps or the XtoPS program from the ImageMagick \ndistribution. The PBMPLUS package is also good for this, as is the Xim package.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject:  26)  How do I make a screendump including the X cursor?\n\n\tThis can't be done unless the X server has been extended. Consider \ninstead a system-dependent mechanism for, e.g.,  capturing the frame-buffer.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject:  27)  How do I convert/view Mac/TIFF/GIF/Sun/PICT/img/FAX images in X?\n\n\tThe likeliest program is an incarnation of Jef Poskanzer's useful++ \nPortable Bitmap Toolkit, which includes a number of programs for converting \namong various image formats. It includes support for many types of bitmaps, \ngray-scale images, and full-color images. PBMPLUS has been updated recently;\nthe most recent version [12/91] is on export in contrib/pbmplus10dec91.tar.Z.\n\tAnother tool is San Diego Supercomputing Center's IMtools ('imconv' in \nparticular), which packages the functionality of PBM into a single binary.\nIt's available anonymous ftp from sdsc.edu (132.249.20.22).\n\n\tUseful for viewing some image-formats is Jim Frost's xloadimage, a\nversion of which is in the R4 directory contrib/clients/xloadimage; there are \nlater versions available, including contrib/xloadimage.3.03.tar.Z on export.  \nGraeme Gill's updates to an earlier version of xloadimage are also on export; \nsee xli.README and xli.tar.Z.uu; version 1.14 was released 2/93.\n\n\txv (X Image Viewer), written by bradley@cis.upenn.edu (John Bradley), \ncan read and display pictures in Sun Raster, PGM, PBM, PPM, X11 bitmap, TIFF, \nGIF and JPEG. It can manipulate on the images: adjust, color, intensity, \ncontrast, aspect ratio, crop). It can save images in all of the aforementioned \nformats plus PostScript. It can grab a portion of the X display, manipulate on \nit, and save it in one of the available formats. The program was updated 5/92; \nsee the file contrib/xv-2.21.tar.Z on export.lcs.mit.edu.\n\n\tThe Fuzzy Pixmap Manipulation, by Michael Mauldin <mlm@nl.cs.cmu.edu>.\nConversion and manipulation package, similar to PBMPLUS.  Version 1.0 available\nvia FTP as nl.cs.cmu.edu:/usr/mlm/ftp/fbm.tar.Z, uunet.uu.net:pub/fbm.tar.Z, \nand ucsd.edu:graphics/fbm.tar.Z.\n\n\tThe Img Software Set, by Paul Raveling <raveling@venera.isi.edu>, reads\nand writes its own image format, displays on an X11 screen, and does some image\nmanipulations.  Version 1.3 is available via FTP on expo.lcs.mit.edu as\ncontrib/img_1.3.tar.Z, along with large collection of color images.\n\n\tThe Utah RLE Toolkit is a conversion and manipulation package similar \nto PBMPLUS.  Available via FTP as cs.utah.edu:pub/urt-*, \nweedeater.math.yale.edu:pub/urt-*, and freebie.engin.umich.edu:pub/urt-*.\n\n\tXim, The X Image Manipulator, by Philip Thompson, does essential \ninteractive displaying, editing, filtering, and converting of images. There is \na version in the X11R4 contrib area; but a more recent version (using R4 and \nMotif 1.1) is available from gis.mit.edu (18.80.1.118). Xim reads/writes gif, \nxwd, xbm, tiff, rle, xim, (writes level 2 eps) and other formats and also has a\nlibrary and command-line utilities for building your own applications.\n\n\tImageMagick [2.3; 2/93] by cristy@dupont.com can be retrieved from \nexport's contrib area. It is a collection of utilities to transform and display\nimages on any X server. The tool uses the MIFF format; filters to and from MIFF\nfrom other popular formats (PPM, TIFF, GIF, SUN Raster, etc) are included.\n\n\txtiff is a tool for viewing a TIFF file in an X window.  It was written\nto handle as many different kinds of TIFF files as possible while remaining\nsimple, portable and efficient.  xtiff illustrates some common problems\nwith building pixmaps and using different visual classes.  It is distributed\nas part of Sam Leffler's libtiff package and it is also available on\nexport.lcs.mit.edu, uunet.uu.net and comp.sources.x. [dbs@decwrl.dec.com,10/90]\nxtiff 2.0 was announced in 4/91; it includes Xlib and Xt versions.\n\n\tA version of Lee Iverson's (leei@McRCIM.McGill.EDU) image-viewing tool\nis available as contrib/vimage-0.9.3.tar.Z on export.lcs.mit.edu.  The package \nalso includes an ImageViewPort widget and a FileDialog widget. [12/91;5/92] \n\n[some material from Larry Carroll (larryc@poe.jpl.nasa.gov), 5/91]\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject:  28)  How can I change the titlebar of my xterm window?\n\n\tThe solution involves sending an escape sequence to xterm which will\ncause it to update the property which the window manager relies upon for the\nstring which appears in the window titlebar.\n\tA solution is as easy as typing this in an xterm running a shell:\n\t\techo \"ESC]2;TEXT^G\"\nwhere ESC is the escape key, TEXT is the string you wish to have displayed,\nand ^G is a Control-G (the BEL character).\n\n\tHere is a more complicated csh alias which changes the titlebar to\nthe current working directory when you change directories:\n\t\talias newcd 'cd \\!*; echo -n ESC]2\\;$cwd^G'\n\n\tThe digit '2' in these strings indicates to xterm that it should \nchange only the title of the window; to change both the title and the name \nused in the icon, use the digit '0' instead, and use '1' to change only the \nicon name.\n\n\tNote: another way to do this, which prevents an incorrect display of\nthe local directory if a modified `cd` is used in a subshell, is to wrap the\nescape sequences into the PS1 prompt itself.\n\n\tNote: on an IBM RS/6000 is may be necessary to begin the sequence with\na ^V.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject:  29)  Where can I find the xterm control sequences?\n\nThe best source of such information is in your R5 sources in the file \nctlseqs.ms; a PostScript version is in mit/hardcopy/clients/ctlseqs.PS.Z.\n\nO'Reilly's Volume 3, the X User's Guide, includes an R5 version of the control \nsequences; the standard volume will be available 3/93, and a Motif version of \nthe book is available now. The current (R4) guide includes an outdated version\nof the control sequences. [1/93]\n\nOther good sources of information include the R4 version of that document\nand also the file in the R4 sources called mit/clients/xterm/ctlseq2.txt, a \ncompilation put together by Skip Montanaro (GE CR&D) listing the VT100 \nsequences. It dates from R3 but is fairly accurate.  A hardcopy version was \npublished in the December 1989 XNextEvent (the XUG newsletter).\n\nIn a pinch, a VT100 manual will do.\n\n[last updated 10/91]\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject:  30)- Why does the R3 xterm, et al, fail against the R4 server?\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject:  31)  How can I use characters above ASCII 127 in xterm ?\n\n\tIn order to use special characters such as the o-umlaut, you need to \n\"stty pass8\" but also to use a charcell ISO8859 font, such as \n\tXTerm*font: \t-*-*-medium-r-normal-*-*-130-*-*-c-*-iso8859-1\n\tXTerm*boldfont:\t-*-*-bold-r-normal-*-*-130-*-*-c-*-iso8859-1\n[The family is intentionally unspecified in this example.]\n\nIn addition, you may want to set this in your shell:\n\tsetenv LC_CTYPE iso_8859_1\n\n        For a given character above 127, you can determine the key to use with \nthe Alt modifier by finding the equivalent character below 127 (try using\n`man ascii`). For example, o-umlaut (v) is Alt-v and the section character (') \nis Alt-'. \n\n[thanks to Greg Holmberg (greg%thirdi@uunet.uu.net) and Stephen Gildea \n(gildea@expo.lcs.mit.edu); 6/92]\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject:  32)  Why are my xterm menus so small?\n\n\tYou are probably setting the geometry small accidentally. If you give \na resource specification like this:\n\t\txterm*geometry: 80x24\nthen you are asking for all widgets under xterm to have their geometry set to\n80x24. For the main window, this is OK, as it uses characters for its size. \nBut its popup menus don't; they are in pixels and show up small. To set only\nthe terminal widget to have the specified geometry, name it explicitly:\n\t\txterm*VT100.geometry: 80x24\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject:  33)  How can I print the current selection?\n\n\tYou could paste it into an xterm after executing the lpr command. \nHowever, a program by Richard Hesketh (rlh2@ukc.ac.uk) specifically for \nmanipulating the selection will help; e.g. \n\t% xselection PRIMARY | lpr\nfinds the primary selection and prints it. This command can be placed in a \nwindow-manager menu or in shell-scripts. xselection also permits the setting of\nthe selection and other properties. A version is on export.\n\tAlso available is ria.ccs.uwo.ca:pub/xget_selection.tar.Z, which can be\nadapted to do this.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject:  34)  How does Xt use environment variables in loading resources?\n\n\tYou can use several environment variables to control how resources are \nloaded for your Xt-based programs -- XFILESEARCHPATH, XUSERFILESEARCHPATH, and \nXAPPLRESDIR.  These environment variables control where Xt looks for \napplication-defaults files as an application is initializing.  Xt loads at most\none app-defaults file from the path defined in XFILESEARCHPATH and another from\nthe path defined in XUSERFILESEARCHPATH.\n\n\tSet XFILESEARCHPATH if software is installed on your system in such a \nway that app-defaults files appear in several different directory hierarchies.\nSuppose, for example, that you are running Sun's Open Windows, and you also \nhave some R4 X applications installed in /usr/lib/X11/app-defaults. You could \nset a value like this for XFILESEARCHPATH, and it would cause Xt to look up \napp-defaults files in both /usr/lib/X11 and /usr/openwin/lib (or wherever your\nOPENWINHOME is located):\n\tsetenv XFILESEARCHPATH /usr/lib/X11/%T/%N:$OPENWINHOME/lib/%T/%N\n\nThe value of this environment variable is a colon-separated list of pathnames.  The pathnames contain replacement characters as follows (see \nXtResolvePathname()):\n\n        %N      The value of the filename parameter, or the\n                application's class name.\n        %T      The value of the file \"type\".  In this case, the\n                literal string \"app-defaults\"\n        %C      customization resource (R5 only)\n        %S      Suffix.  None for app-defaults.\n        %L      Language, locale, and codeset (e.g. \"ja_JP.EUC\")\n        %l      Language part of %L  (e.g. \"ja\")\n        %t      The territory part of the display's language string\n        %c      The codeset part of the display's language string\n\n\tLet's take apart the example.  Suppose the application's class name is \n\"Myterm\". Also, suppose Open Windows is installed in /usr/openwin. (Notice the \nexample omits locale-specific lookup.)\n\t/usr/lib/X11/%T/%N        means /usr/lib/X11/app-defaults/Myterm\n\t$OPENWINHOME/lib/%T/%N    means /usr/openwin/lib/app-defaults/Myterm\n\n\tAs the application initializes, Xt tries to open both of the above \napp-defaults files, in the order shown.  As soon as it finds one, it reads it \nand uses it, and stops looking for others.  The effect of this path is to \nsearch first in /usr/lib/X11, then in /usr/openwin.\n\n\tLet's consider another example. This time, let's set \nXUSERFILESEARCHPATH so it looks for the file Myterm.ad in the current working \ndirectory, then for Myterm in the directory ~/app-defaults.\n\tsetenv XUSERFILESEARCHPATH ./%N.ad:$HOME/app-defaults/%N\n\n\tThe first path in the list expands to ./Myterm.ad.  The second expands \nto $HOME/app-defaults/Myterm.  This is a convenient setting for debugging \nbecause it follows the Imake convention of naming the app-defaults file \nMyterm.ad in the application's source directory, so you can run the application\nfrom the directory in which you are working and still have the resources loaded\nproperly.  NOTE: when looking for app-default files with XUSERFILESEARCHPATH,\nfor some  bizarre reason, neither the type nor file suffix is defined so %T and\n%S are useless.\n\n\tWith R5, there's another twist.  You may specify a customization \nresource value.  For example, you might run the \"myterm\" application like this:\n\tmyterm -xrm \"*customization: -color\"\n\n\tIf one of your pathname specifications had the value\n\"/usr/lib/X11/%T/%N%C\" then the expanded pathname would be\n\"/usr/lib/X11/app-defaults/Myterm-color\" because the %C substitution character \ntakes on the value of the customization resource.\n\n\tThe default XFILESEARCHPATH, compiled into Xt, is:\n\t\t/usr/lib/X11/%L/%T/%N%C:\\  (R5)\n\t\t/usr/lib/X11/%l/%T/%N%C:\\  (R5)\n\t\t/usr/lib/X11/%T/%N%C:\\     (R5)\n\t\t/usr/lib/X11/%L/%T/%N:\\\n\t\t/usr/lib/X11/%l/%T/%N:\\\n\t\t/usr/lib/X11/%T/%N\n\n\t(Note: some sites replace /usr/lib/X11 with a ProjectRoot in\nthis batch of default settings.)\n\n\tThe default XUSERFILESEARCHPATH, also compiled into Xt, is \n\t\t<root>/%L/%N%C:\\  (R5)\n\t\t<root>/%l/%N%C:\\  (R5)\n\t\t<root>/%N%C:\\     (R5)\n\t\t<root>/%L/%N:\\\n\t\t<root>/%l/%N:\\\n\t\t<root>/%N:\n\n\t<root> is either the value of XAPPLRESDIR or the user's home directory \nif XAPPLRESDIR is not set.  If you set XUSERFILESEARCHPATH to some value other \nthan the default, Xt ignores XAPPLRESDIR altogether.\n\n\tNotice that the quick and dirty way of making your application find \nyour app-defaults file in your current working directory is to set XAPPLRESDIR \nto \".\", a single dot.  In R3, all this machinery worked differently; for R3 \ncompatibilty, many people set their XAPPLRESDIR value to \"./\", a dot followed \nby a slash.\n\n[Thanks to Oliver Jones (oj@world.std.com); 2/93.]\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject:  35)  How to I have the R4 xdm put a picture behind the log-in window?\n\nThe answer lies in changing xdm's xrdb resource in the xdm-config file to run a\nprogram to change the background before loading the resources; for example, \nyour /usr/lib/X11/xdm/xdm-config file may add the line \n\tDisplayManager.0.authorize: false \nto permit unrestricted access to the display before log-in (beware!) and also \n\tDisplayManager*xrdb:\t/usr/lib/X11/xdm/new.xrdb\nwhere that file does something (for all connections) along the lines of:\n\t#!/bin/sh\n\t#comes in with arguments: -display :0 -load /usr/lib/X11/xdm/Xresources\n\t/usr/bin/X11/xsetroot -display $2 -bitmap /usr/lib/X11/xdm/new.bitmap\n\t/usr/bin/X11/xrdb $*\nSubstitute xloadimage or xv for xsetroot, to taste.  Note that this is a \ngeneral hack that can be used to invoke a console window or any other client.\n\n[Thanks to Jay Bourland (jayb@cauchy.stanford.edu), 9/91]\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject:  36)  Why isn't my PATH set when xdm runs my .xsession file?\n\n\tWhen xdm runs your .xsession it doesn't source your .cshrc or .login\nfiles. You can set the path explicitly as you normally could for any SH script;\nor you can place all environment-setting statements in a separate file and\nsource it from both the .xsession file and your shell configuration file; or,\nif you set your PATH in your .cshrc file, the normal place, you can make your \n.xsession have PATH set simply by making it a csh script, i.e. by starting\nyour .xsession file off with \"#!/bin/csh\". \n\tIf this doesn't work, also try starting off with:\n\t\t#!/bin/sh\n\t\t# Reset path:\n\t\tPATH=`csh -c 'echo $PATH'` ; export PATH\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject:  37)  How do I keep my $DISPLAY when I rlogin to another machine?\n\n\tThere are several ways to avoid having to do a \"setenv DISPLAY ...\"\nwhenever you log in to another networked UNIX machine running X.\n\tOne solution is to use the clients/xrsh on the R5 contrib tape.  It \nincludes xrsh, a script to start an X application on remote machine, and\nxrlogin, a script to start a local xterm running rlogin to a remote machine.\nA more recent version is on export in xrsh-5.4.shar.\n\tOne solution is to use the xrlogin program from der Mouse\n(mouse@larry.mcrcim.mcgill.edu). You can ftp caveat-emptor versions from\n132.206.1.1, in X/xrlogin.c and X/xrlogind.c. The program packages up $TERM and\n$DISPLAY into a single string, which is stuffed into $TERM.  rlogin then \npropagates $TERM normally; your .cshrc on the remote machine should contain\n\t\teval `xrlogind`\nwhere xrlogind is a program that checks $TERM and if it is of the special \nformat it recognizes, unpacks it and spits out setenv and unsetenv commands to \nrecreate the environment variables. [11/90]\n\n\tIn addition, if all you need to do is start a remote X process on \nanother host, and you find\n\t\trsh <HOST> -n /usr/bin/X11/xterm -display $DISPLAY \ntoo simple (DISPLAY must have your real hostname), then this version of xrsh \ncan be used to start up remote X processes. The equivalent usage would be \n\t\txrsh <HOST> xterm\n\n  #! /bin/sh\n  # start an X11 process on another host\n  # Date: 8 Dec 88 06:29:34 GMT\n  # From: Chris Torek <chris@mimsy.umd.edu>\n  # rsh $host -n \"setenv DISPLAY $DISPLAY; exec $@ </dev/null >&/dev/null\"\n  #\n  # An improved version:\n  # rXcmd (suggested by John Robinson, jr@bbn.com)\n  #       (generalized for sh,ksh by Keith Boyer, keith@cis.ohio-state.edu)\n  #\n  # but they put the rcmd in ()'s which left zombies again.

See Ollie Jones's article in the November 91 X \nJournal for more information.\n\tThe R3 contrib/ area (in fonts/utils/ and in clients/xtroff) contained \na number of useful utilities, including some to convert between BDF font format\nand a simple character format which can be edited with any text editor.\n\tAn easier way is to use the \"xfed\" client to modify an existing font; a\nversion is on the R4 or R5 X11R5 contrib tape in contrib/clients/xfed. Xfed is \navailable for anonymous ftp on ftp.Informatik.Uni-Dortmund.DE [129.217.64.63], \npossibly as file /pub/windows/X/Diverse-X11-Sourcen/xfed.tar.Z. It can produce\nBDF-format fonts which can be compiled for a variety of X servers.\n\tThe xfedor client from Group Bull permits creation of bitmaps, cursors,\nXPM1 pixmaps, and fonts. Binaries for common machines are on avahi.inria.fr in\n/pub; in addition, the sources (an old Xlib implementation) have been placed \n[5/91] in export:/contrib. \n\tIf you are a MetaFont user you can use \"mftobdf\" from the SeeTeX\ndistribution to convert PK, GF, and PXL fonts to BDF format; the distribution\nis on ftp.cs.colorado.edu and on export.lcs.mit.edu.\n\tThe GNU package fontutils-0.4.tar.Z on prep.ai.mit.edu includes xbfe,\na font editor, and a number of utilities for massaging font formats.\n\tThe O'Reilly X Resource issue #2 contains an article on using these\ntools to modify a font.\n\tFonts can be resized with Hiroto Kagotani's bdfresize; a new version is\nin ftp.cs.titech.ac.jp:/X11/contrib.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject:  39)  Why does adding a font to the server not work (sic)?\n\n\tAfter you have built the font using your system's font-compiler, \ninstalled it in some directory, and run `mkfontdir` or your system's equivalent\n(e.g. bldfamily for OpenWindows) in that directory, be sure to use `xset +fp \n$dir` to add that full path-name to the server's font-path, *or* if the \ndirectory is already in the path, use `xset fp rehash` so that the new fonts in\nthat directory are actually found; it is this last step that you're probably \nleaving out. (You can also use `xset q` to make sure that that directory is in \nthe path.)\n\tSometimes your \"xset +fp $dir\" command fails with a BadValue error:\n\t\tX Error of failed request:BadValue\n\t\t\t(integer parameter out of range for operation)\n\t\tMajor opcode of failed request:  51 (X_SetFontPath)\n\n\tThis means the X server cannot find or read your font directory, or\nthat your directory does not look like a font directory to the server.  (The\nmention of an \"integer parameter\" in the message is spurious.)\n\n-- Is the font directory you're specifying readable from the SERVER's file\n   system?  Remember, it's the server, not the client, which interprets your\n   font directory.  Trouble in this area is especially likely when you issue an\n   xset command with shell metacharacters in it (e.g. \"xset +fp ~/myfonts\") and\n   the server is an X terminal or managed by xdm.\n\n-- Is the directory really a font directory?  If you're running an MIT server\n   (or most varieties of vendor servers) look in the directory for the file\n   \"fonts.dir\".  If you can't find that file, run mkfontdir(1).  (If you're\n   running OpenWindows, look for the file \"Families.list\".  If you can't find\n   it, run bldfamily(1).)\n\n-- If you're in a site where some people run X11Rn servers and others run a\n   proprietary server with nonstandard font formats (OpenWindows, for\n   example), make sure the font directory is right for the server you're using.\n   Hint: if the directory contains .pcf and/or .snf files, it won't work for\n   Open Windows.  If the directory contains .ff and/or .fb files, it won't work\n   for X11Rn.\n\n[thanks to der Mouse (mouse@larry.mcrcim.mcgill.edu) and to Oliver Jones \n(oj@pictel.com); 7/92 ]\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject:  40)  How do I convert a \".snf\" font back to \".bdf\" font?\n\n\tA tool called \"snftobdf 1.4\" is part of the bdftools package, which is \navailable from export.lcs.mit.edu:contrib/bdftools.tar.Z and from \ncrl.nmsu.edu:pub/misc/bdftools.tar.Z.  [2/91]\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject:  41)  What is a general method of getting a font in usable format?\n\n\tder Mouse's getbdf is one solution; it connects to a server and \nproduces a .BDF file for any font the server is willing to let it.  It can be \nused as an anything-to-BDF converter, but requires access to a server that can \nunderstand the font file, thus is both more and less powerful than other tools \nsuch as snftobdf. getbdf is on 132.206.1.1 in X/getbdf.c or available via mail \nfrom mouse@larry.McRCIM.McGill.EDU. [5/91]\n\tIn addition, the R5 program \"fstobdf\" can produce bdf for any font that\nthe R5 server has access to.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject:  42)  How do I use DECwindows fonts on my non-DECwindows server?\n\n\tThe DECwindows fonts typically don't exist on a non-DEC installation,\nbut rewrite rules can be used to alias fonts used by DECwindows applications to\nstandard MIT fonts of similar characteristics and size. Pick up the file \ncontrib/DECwindows_on_X11R4_font.aliases from export.lcs.mit.edu; this file is \nfor a standard MIT R4 server.  It can also serve as a starting point for \ncreating a similar aliases file for the Open Windows server or other servers \nwhich do not use the MIT font scheme.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject:  43)  How do I add \".bdf\" fonts to my DECwindows server?\n\n\tThe format of fonts preferred by DEC's X server is the \".pcf\" format.\nYou can produce this compiled format from the .bdf format by using DEC's dxfc\nfont-compiler. Note that the DEC servers can also use raw .bdf fonts, with a\nperformance hit.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject:  44)! How can I set backgroundPixmap in a defaults file? (What is XPM?)\nI want to be able to do something like this:\n\txclock*backgroundPixmap:      /usr/include/X11/bitmaps/rootweave\n\n\tYou can't do this. The backgroundPixmap resource is a pixmap of the \nsame depth as the screen, not a bitmap (which is a pixmap of depth 1). Because \nof this, writing a generic String to Pixmap converter is impossible, since \nthere is no accepted convention for a file format for pixmaps. Therefore, \nneither the X Toolkit or the Athena widget set define a String to Pixmap \nconverter, because there is no converter you cannot specify this value as a \nresource.  The Athena widget set does define a String to Bitmap converter for \nuse in many of its widgets, however.\n[courtesy Chris D. Peterson (now kit@ics.com), 4/90]\n\nHowever:\n\tA specific converter which encapsulates much of the functionality of \nthe xloadimage package by Jim Frost was posted 12/90 by Sebastian Wangnick \n(basti@unido.informatik.uni-dortmund.de); it permits loading of a number of \nimage formats as a pixmap.\n\n\tThe leading general-purpose format for pixmaps is the XPM format used \nby Groupe Bull in several of its programs, including the GWM window manager, by\nAT&T in its olpixmap editor, and by ICS in its interface builder. XPM \ndistribution, available on export as contrib/xpm.tar.Z, includes read/write \nroutines which can easily be adapted to converters by new widgets which want to\nallow specification of pixmap resources in the above manner.  See information\non the xpm-talk mailing list above. XPM 3.0f was announced in 3/93 and is\navailable from export.lcs.mit.edu and avahi.inria.fr; an older version is on \nthe R5 contrib tape.

Only the first item works.\n\n\tYou probably have an extra space after the specification of the first \nitem, like this:\n\tbasic*text.translations:  #override \\\n\tCtrl<Key>a:    beginning-of-line() \\n\\ \t\n\tCtrl<Key>e:    end-of-line()\n\t\t\t\t\t      ^ extra space\nThe newline after that space is ending the translation definition.\n[Thanks to Timothy J. Horton, 5/91]\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject:  46)  How can I have xclock or oclock show different timezones?\n\n\tOne solution is xchron, in Volume 6 of comp.sources.x, which can show\nthe time for timezones other than the local one. \n\tAlternatively, you can probably set the timezone in the shell from\nwhich you invoke the xclock or oclock, or use a script similar to this:\n\t#!/bin/sh\n\tTZ=PST8PDT xclock -name \"San_Luis_Obispo_CA\" 2> /dev/null &\n\tTZ=EST5EDT xclock -name \"King_Of_Prussia_PA\" 2> /dev/null &\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject:  47)  I have xmh, but it doesn't work. Where can I get MH?\n\n\tThe xmh mail-reader requires the Rand MH mail/message handling system,\nwhich is not part of the UNIX software distribution for many machines. A list \nof various ftp, uucp, e-mail and US-mail sites for both xmh and MH is given in \nthe monthly MH FAQ; one source is ics.uci.edu in the file pub/mh/mh-6.7.tar.Z.\nIf you do not receive the comp.mail.mh newsgroup or the MH-users mailing list, \nyou can request a copy of the FAQ, which also includes a section on xmh, \nby sending mail to mail-server@pit-manager.mit.edu containing the request\n\"send usenet/news.answers/mh-faq\".\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nSubject:  48)  Why am I suddenly unable to connect to my Sun X server?\nAfter a seemingly random amount of time after the X server has been started, no\nother clients are able to connect to it.\n\n\tThe default cron cleanup jobs supplied by Sun (for 4.0.3, at least)\ndelete \"old\" (unreferenced) files from /tmp -- including /tmp/.X11-unix, which \ncontains the socket descriptor used by X.

{"text":"Classify the following data: I'd like to share my thoughts on this topic of \"arrogance of\nChristians\" and look forward to any responses.  In my\nencounters with Christians, I find myself dismayed by their\nbelief that their faith is total truth.  According to them,\ntheir beliefs come from the Bible and the bible is the word of\nGod and God is truth - thus they know the truth.  This stance\nmakes it difficult to discuss other faiths with them and my own\nhesitations about Christianity because they see no other way.\nTheir way is the 'truth.'\n\nBut I see their faith arising from a willful choice to believe\na particular way.  That choice is part faith and part reason,\nbut it seems to me a choice.\n\nMy discussions with some Christians remind me of schoolyard\ndiscussions when I was in grade school:\n\nA kid would say, \"All policemen are jerks!\"  I'd ask, \"How do\nyou know?\"  \"Because my daddy told me so!\"  \"How do you know\nyou're daddy is right?\"  \"He says he's always right!\"\n\nWell the argument usually stops right there.  In the end,\naren't we all just kids, groping for the truth?  If so, do we have\nthe authority to declare all other beliefs besides our own as\nfalse?\n\n-------------\n\nThis is only my third time browsing through this newsgroup.  I\napologize if I'm covering tired old ground.  Some of the\ndiscussions on this topic have piqued my interest and I welcome\nany comments.\n\n-- \n\n[I'm sort of mystified about how a Christian might respond to this.  I\ncan understand criticisms of Christianity that say there's not enough\nevidence to believe it, or that there's just as good evidence for\nother religions.  I don't agree, but clearly there are plenty of\nintelligent people who don't find the evidence convincing.  But that\ndoesn't seem to be your point.  Rather, you seem upset that people who\nbelieve Christianity is true also believe that things which contradict\nit are false.\n\nThis suggests a model of spiritual things that's rather different than\nthe Christian one.  It sounds more like an existentialist view, where\npeople choose what value to follow, but there's no actual independent\nspiritual reality, and so no way to say that a specific choice is in\nsome unique sense right.  This sort of model -- with modifications of\none sort or another -- may be appropriate for some religions.  But\nChristianity is in its essense a \"historical\" religion.  That is, it's\nbased on the concept that there are actual spiritual entities out\nthere, that one of them has intervened in history in specific ways,\nand that we see evidence of that in history.  In the \"mundane\" world,\nwe are not free to choose how things work.  When we drop something, it\nfalls (aside from well-defined situations where it doesn't).  The\nChristian concept is that spiritual matters, there is also an actual\nexternal reality.  I hope we're all honest enough not to claim that we\nhave perfect understanding.  But while we may not think we know\neverything, we are confident that we know some things.  And that\nimplies that we think things that contradict them are false.  I don't\nsee how else we could proceed.\n\nThis needn't result in arrogance.  I'm certainly interested in talking\nwith people of other religions.  They may have things to teach me, and\neven if they don't, I respect them as fellow human beings.  But it's\ngot to be possible to respect people and also think that on some\nmatters they are wrong.  Maybe even disasterously wrong.","label":"soc.religion.christian"}

Gibbons, Director, Office of Science and Technology\nPolicy, outlined to the members-designate of the Advisory Committee on the\nRedesign of the Space Station on April 3, three budget options as guidance\nto the committee in their deliberations on the redesign of the space\nstation.\n\n        A low option of $5 billion, a mid-range option of $7 billion and a\nhigh option of $9 billion will be considered by the committee.  Each\noption would cover the total expenditures for space station from fiscal\nyear 1994 through 1998 and would include funds for development,\noperations, utilization, Shuttle integration, facilities, research\noperations support, transition cost and also must include adequate program\nreserves to insure program implementation within the available funds.\n\n        Over the next 5 years, $4 billion is reserved within the NASA\nbudget for the President's new technology investment.  As a result,\nstation options above $7 billion must be accompanied by offsetting\nreductions in the rest of the NASA budget.  For example, a space station\noption of $9 billion would require $2 billion in offsets from the NASA\nbudget over the next 5 years.\n\n        Gibbons presented the information at an organizational session of\nthe advisory committee.  Generally, the members-designate focused upon\nadministrative topics and used the session to get acquainted.  They also\nreceived a legal and ethics briefing and an orientation on the process the\nStation Redesign Team is following to develop options for the advisory\ncommittee to consider.\n\n        Gibbons also announced that the United States and its\ninternational partners -- the Europeans, Japanese and Canadians -- have\ndecided, after consultation, to give \"full consideration\" to use of\nRussian assets in the course of the space station redesign process.\n\n        To that end, the Russians will be asked to participate in the\nredesign effort on an as-needed consulting basis, so that the redesign\nteam can make use of their expertise in assessing the capabilities of MIR\nand the possible use of MIR and other Russian capabilities and systems.\nThe U.S. and international partners hope to benefit from the expertise of\nthe Russian participants in assessing Russian systems and technology.  The\noverall goal of the redesign effort is to develop options for reducing\nstation costs while preserving key research and exploration capabilitiaes.\nCareful integration of Russian assets could be a key factor in achieving\nthat goal.\n\n        Gibbons reiterated that, \"President Clinton is committed to the\nredesigned space station and to making every effort to preserve the\nscience, the technology and the jobs that the space station program\nrepresents.  However, he also is committed to a space station that is well\nmanaged and one that does not consume the national resources which should\nbe used to invest in the future of this industry and this nation.\"\n\n        NASA Administrator Daniel S.  Goldin said the Russian\nparticipation will be accomplished through the East-West Space Science\nCenter at the University of Maryland under the leadership of Roald\nSagdeev.","label":"sci.space"}

{"text":"Classify the following data: Hi,\n\nI've just returned from a visit with my OB/GYN and I have a few \nconcerns that maybe y'all can help me with.  I've been seeing \nher every 4 weeks for the past few months (I'm at week 28) \nand during the last 2 visits I've gained 9 to 9 1/2 pounds every \n4 weeks.  She said this was unacceptable over any 4 week period. \nAs it stands I've thus far gained 26 pounds.  Also she says that \nthough I'm at 28 weeks the baby's size is 27 weeks, I think she \nmentioned 27 inches for the top of the fundus.  When I was 13 \nweeks the baby's size was 14 weeks.  I must also add, that I had \nan operation a few years ago for endometriosis and I've had no \nproblems with endometriosis but apparently it is causing me pain \nin my pelvic region during the pregnancy, and I have a very \ndifficult time moving, and the doc has recommended I not walk or \nmove unless I have to. (I have a little handicapped sticker for \nwhen I do need to go out.) \n\nAnyway that's 1/2 of the situation the other is that almost from \nthe beginning of pregnancy I was getting sick (throwing up) about \n2-3 times a day and mostly it was bile that was being eliminated.  \n(I told her about this).  I know this because I wasn't eating \nvery much due to the nausea and could see the 'results'.  Well \nnow I only get sick about once every 1-2 weeks, and it is still bile \nrelated.  But in addition I had begun to feel movement near my \nupper right abdomen, just below the right breast, usually when I \nwas lying on my right side.  It began to get worse though because \nit started to hurt when I lay on my right side, and then it hurt  \nno matter what position I was in.  Next, I noticed that when I \nate greasy or fatty foods I felt like my entire abdomen had \nturned to stone, and the pain in the area got worse.  However if \nI ate sauerkraut or vinegar or something to 'cut' the fat it \nwasn't as much of a problem.\n\nSo the doctor says I have cholistatis, and that I should avoid \nfatty foods.  This makes sense, and because I was already aware \nof what seemed to me this cause and effect relationship I have \nbeen avoiding these foods on my own.  But I'm still able to eat \nfoods with Ricotta cheese for instance and other low fat foods.  \n\nBut doc wants me to be on a non-fat diet.  This means no meat \nexcept fish and chicken w/o skin (I do this anyway).  No nuts, \nfried food, cheese etc.  I am allowed skim milk.  She said I \nshould avoid anything sweet (e.g. bananas).  Also I must only \nhave one serving of something high in carbohydrates a day ( \npotatoes, pasta, rice)!  She said I can't even cook vegetables in \na little bit of oil and that I should eat vegetables raw or \nsteamed.  I'm concerned because I understand you need to have \nsome fat in your diet to help in the digestive process.  And if \nI'm not taking in fat, is she expecting the baby will take it \nfrom my stores?  And why this restriction on carbohydrates if \nshe's concerned about fat?  I'm not clear how much of her \nrecommendation is based on my weight gain and how much on \ncholistatis, which I can't seem to find any information on.  She \noriginally said that I should only gain 20 pounds during the \nentire pregnancy since I was about 20 lbs overweight when I \nstarted.  But my sister gained 60 lbs during her pregnancy and \nshe's taken it all off and hasn't had any problems.  She also \nasked if any members of my family were obese, which none of them \nare.  Anyway I think she is overly concerned about weight gain, \nand feel like I'm being 'punished' by a severe diet.  She did \nwant to see me again in one week so I think she the diet may be \ntemporary for that one week. \n\nWhat I want to know is how reasonable is this non-fat diet?  I \nwould understand if she had said low-fat diet, since I'm trying \nthat anyway, even if she said really low-fat diet.

{"text":"Classify the following data: As our local.religion.christian BBS group seems moribund, I'm posting here.\n\nOn one of the Sundays just before Easter I went to church.  The sermon was\nbased on a story in the Book of Joshua.  (The one about Joshua sending out\nspies to the land he was planning to take)  What I particularly remember,\nbecause of having heard part of a CBC radio documentary on Bosnia, was that\nthe Rahab (the woman who sheltered the spies) said that the people were\n\"melting in fear.\"  What with having heard that CBC radio documentary and\nknowing that the Muslims in Bosnia were losing the war, I felt\nuncomfortable.  After all, the Serbs are driving non-Christians out.  On\nthe other hand, ministers do say that the Bible is opposed to the values\nheld by our secular society.  Anyhow members of that church are involved in\nout-of-country missionary work.  Also, the pastor has talked of spiritual\nwarfare and of bringing Christ to the nonreligious people of our area.\n\nThe next Sunday, the sermon was about Joshua 6 (where the Israelites\ntake Jericho and then proceed to massacre everybody there --- except\nfor Rahab, who had sheltered the spies).  With those reports about\nBosnia in my mind, I felt uncomfortable about the minister saying that\nthe massacre (the one in Joshua) was right.  But what really bothered\nme was that, if I was going to try taking Christianity seriously, I\nshouldn't be so troubled about the reports of \"ethnic cleansing\" in\nBosnia.  Certainly, my sympathies shouldn't be with the Moslims.\nConsidering that the Bosnian Muslims are descendants of Christians\nwho, under Turkish rule, converted to Islam could the Serbs be doing\nGod's work?","label":"soc.religion.christian"}

A principle, standard, or quality\nconsidered inherently worthwhile or desirable. 5. Precise meaning, as\nof a word. 6. An assigned or calculated numerical quantity. 7. Mus. \nThe relative duratation of a tone or rest. 8. The relative darkness or\nlightness of a color. 9.

In fact, if one\nconcludes that a scientific set of measurements (values) are based on\nsystems derived from observation, then it must follow that in a\nscientific context, there is no such thing as there is no such thing as\n\"objective values.\"\n\nBack to the present. This has nothing to do with a moral system anyhow.\nJust because the word \"values\" is used in both contexts does not mean\nthat there is a relationship between the two contexts.\n\nIf one is to argue for objective values (in a moral sense) then one must\nfirst start by demonstrating that morality itself is objective. Considering\nthe meaning of the word \"objective\" I doubt that this will ever happen.\n\nSo, back to the original question:\n\nAnd objective morality is.....?\n\nIf you can provide an objective foundation for \"morality\" then that will\nbe a good beginning.\n","label":"talk.religion.misc"}

{"text":"Classify the following data: 04/19/1993 0000  Lezghis Astir\n\nBy NEJLA SAMMAKIA\n Associated Press Writer\n   \nGUSSAR, Azerbaijan (AP) -- The 600,000 Lezghis of Azerbaijan and Russia have\nbegun clamoring for their own state, threatening turmoil in a tranquil corner \nof the Caucasus.\n\nThe region has escaped the ethnic warfare of neighboring Nagorno-Karabakh,\nAbkhazia and Ossetia, but Lezhgis could become the next minority in the former\nSoviet Union to fight for independence.\n\nLezghis, who are Muslim descendents of nomadic shepherds, are angry about the\nconscription of their young men to fight in Azerbaijan's 5-year-old undeclared\nwar with Armenia.\n\nThey also want to unite the Lezghi regions of Azerbaijan and Russia, which\nwere effectively one until the breakup of the Soviet Union created national\nborders that had been only lines on a map.\n\nA rally of more than 3,000 Lezghis in March to protest conscription and\ndemand a separate \"Lezghistan\" alarmed the Azerbaijani government.\n\nOfficials in Baku, the capital, deny rumors that police shot six\ndemonstrators to death. But the government announced strict security measures\nand began cooperating with Russian authorities to control the movement of\nLezhgis living across the border in the Dagestan region of Russia.\n\nVisitors to Gussar, the center of Lezhgi life, found the town quiet soon\nafter the protest. Children played outdoors in the crisp mountain air.\n\nAt the Sunday bazaar, men in heavy coats and dark fur hats gathered to\ndiscuss grievances ranging from high customs duties at the Russian border to a\nwar they say is not theirs.\n\n\"I have been drafted, but I won't go,\" said Shamil Kadimov, gold teeth\nglinting in the sun. \"Why must I fight a war for the Azerbaijanis? I have\nnothing to do with Armenia.\"\n\nMore than 3,000 people have died in the war, which centers on the disputed\nterritory of Nagorno-Karabakh, about 150 miles to the southeast.\n\nMalik Kerimov, an official in the mayor's office, said only 11 of 300 locals\ndrafted in 1992 had served.\n\n\"The police don't force people to go,\" he said. \"They are afraid of an\nuprising that could be backed by Lezghis in Dagestan.\"\n\nAll the men agreed that police had not fired at the demonstrators, but\ndisagreed on how the protest came about.\n\nSome said it occurred spontaneously when rumors spread that Azerbaijan was\nabout to draft 1,500 men from the Gussar region, where 75,000 Lezghis live.\n\nOthers said the rally was ordered by Gen. Muhieddin Kahramanov, leader of the\nLezhgi underground separatist movement, Sadval, based in Dagestan.\n\n\"We organized the demonstration when families came to us distraught about\ndraft orders,\" said Kerim Babayev, a mathematics teacher who belongs to Sadval.\n\n\"We hope to reunite peacefully, by approaching everyone -- the Azerbaijanis, \nthe Russians.\"\n\nIn the early 18th century, the Lezhgis formed two khanates, or sovereignties,\nin what are now Azerbaijan and Dagestan. They roamed freely with their sheep\nover the green hills and mountains between the two khanates.\n\nBy 1812, the Lezghi areas were joined to czarist Russia. After 1917, they\ncame under Soviet rule. With the disintegration of the Soviet Union, the \n600,000 Lezghis were faced for the first time with strict borders.\n\nAbout half remained in Dagestan and half in newly independent Azerbaijan.\n\n\"We have to pay customs on all this, on cars, on wine,\" complained Mais\nTalibov, a small trader. His goods, laid out on the ground at the bazaar,\nincluded brandy, stomach medication and plastic shoes from Dagestan.\n\n\"We want our own country,\" he said. \"We want to be able to move about easily.\nBut Baku won't listen to us.\"\n\nPhysically, it is hard for outsiders to distinguish Lezhgis from other\nAzerbaijanis. In many villages, they live side by side, working at the same \njobs and intermarrying to some degree.\n\nBut the Lezhgis have a distinctive language, a mixture of Arabic, Turkish and\nPersian with strong guttural vowels.\n\nAzerbaijan officially supports the cultural preservation of its 10 largest\nethnic minorities. The Lezghis have weekly newspapers and some elementary \nschool classes in their language.\n\nAutonomy is a different question. If the Lezghis succeeded in separating from\nAzerbaijan, they would set a precedent for other minorities, such as the \nTalish in the south, the Tats in the nearby mountains and the Avars of eastern\nAzerbaijan.\n\n\n\n","label":"talk.politics.mideast"}

{"text":"Classify the following data: I have a question about tires for my Guzzi. It is a '75 850-T. The tires that\nwere on it when I just bought it are old and cracked. I do not have an\nowners manual for it (yet), but the tires listed in the Haynes manual are:\nFront, 3,50 H 18 ; Rear 4.10 H 18, and pressures recommended are 26 front and\n33 rear. Oddly, the pressure for the same tire on the T-3 is listed at 29 psi\ninstead. Anyone know the reason? As I know though, the pressure I should run\nat is that recommended by the manufacturer of the new tires I purchase.\n\nThe real question I have is this. The old tires that are on the bike are for\nthe front, a Metzler Touring Special, 4.10 H 18, and for the rear an Avon\nRoadrunner 4.70 H 18, (120/90) H 18 as marked on each tire. Both are larger\nthan that listed in the Haynes Manual. What does the owners manual recommend,\nand was it common to go up one size for this bike? Also, this will be my first\nmotorcycle with innertubes. Any comments on the various manufacturers inner\ntube qualities?\n\nThe above sizes are inches (except for the additional mark on the current\nrear tire). What is the best metric match? The local BMW dealer thought\n100/90 H 18 on the front and 120/90 H 18 on the back. He also happens to be\nvery good at getting close to matching mail order prices.\n\nI am thinking of going with a Metzler ME33 Laser (possibly Comp K) on the\nfront and ME88 on the back, both in MBS variety if possible (the longer \nlasting belting system). I already use the ME33 on both the Vision and\nFJ for the front, and like it, and I thought that with the shaft drive\nbehavior and torque from the Guzzi that the ME88 might give more predictable\nback end control and sliding behavior than a ME55 might, as well as giving\nmuch better tire milage life. Any comments?\n\nA friend told me he thought that my bike had Boranni rims which are very\ngood, but are relatively soft and have delicate sidewalls. I do not wish to\nmount the tires myself this first time, so aside from warning the shop to be\ncareful, any other comments I should make? I havn't looked at the rim to\ncheck out the make yet, if it is marked. He just told me late yesterday and\nI havn't had a chance to check the rim type.\n\nOn another note. I will remove the ugly (but in good shape....anyone want it?)\nVetter fairing, and I will run without a windscreen for a while, but eventually\nI would like a simple rounded cafe' style quarter fairing for it. It could be\nfork/handlebar mounted. Any suggestions? Is there such a thing as a frame\nmounted quarter fairing of the cafe' style for this bike? How about lower\nbars/clip-ons for it? I would like to restore the bike into a good condition\nrunner with a few modern updates, but while not being historically exactly\naccurate still have it reflect relatively well a representation of the cafe'\nstyle. (Yes I know to be picky, that period really predates this bike....it is\njust that this bike has such potential for _that_ look.)\n\n-----------------------------Edward Walsh----Hewlett-Packard Company-------\n                             edw@boi.hp.com  Disk Memory Division, MS475\n                             (208)323-2174   P.O.

The latter was written with\n    simplicity of exposition and suitability of digital computation in mind\n    (spherical trig formulae also appear, as do digitally-plotted examples).\n\n    More than you ever cared to know about map projections is in John\n    Snyder's USGS publication \"Map Projections--A Working Manual\", USGS\n    Professional Paper 1395. This contains detailed descriptions of 32\n    projections, with history, features, projection formulas (for both\n    spherical earth and ellipsoidal earth), and numerical test cases. It's a\n    neat book, all 382 pages worth. This one's $20.\n\n    You might also want the companion volume, by Snyder and Philip Voxland,\n    \"An Album of Map Projections\", USGS Professional Paper 1453. This\n    contains less detail on about 130 projections and variants. Formulas are\n    in the back, example plots in the front. $14, 250 pages.\n\n    You can order these 2 ways. The cheap, slow way is direct from USGS:\n    Earth Science Information Center, US Geological Survey, 507 National\n    Center, Reston, VA 22092. (800)-USA-MAPS. They can quote you a price and\n    tell you where to send your money.

For sanity's sake we must assume, if we believe in Him at all,\nthat His message comes through somehow.  The question is whether it comes \nthrough immediately to every individual, or is contained in a complex \ncanon that must be interpreted by experts in consultation with one another, \nor is transmitted directly through appointed representatives who are free\nto interpret, extend and modify the canon.  If God's message is indeed\nmediated, the further problem arises as to whether the individual under-\nstands the mediated message fully and clearly.

(If they *understood*\n  some Wittgenstein, 98% would disappear. :-))\" -- Michael L Siemon\n\n \n\nThere is a convention called a `smiley', which looks like this:   :-)  .\nIt is supposed to look like a sideways smiley-face, and indicates that the\npreceding comment is supposed to be funny.\n\n\nAnd, I'll note that I have participated on talk.religion.misc for over\nfive years -- I'd say Mr Siemon was not too far off.  8^)\n\n *\n\nIn the meat of his reply, Mr Boundary serves up an excellent example of what\nI meant by \"There is no way out of the loop\".  I wrote that human brains \"are\ninfested with sin\", and can be trusted only in limited circumstances.\n\n\n\nWhich just moves the problem back one level: how do you tell if your\nconscience is properly formed?\n\nThe only way to tell is to presuppose that you are capable of judging the\nformed-ness of your own conscience.  In other words, you can only be sure\nthat your conscience is `properly formed' if you assume that your evaluation\ncan be trusted.  Assuming your conclusions saves you a lot of time, I'll\ngrant, but it's not a valid way of reasoning.\n\nUnless you are infallible, your judgements about your own thinking cannot be\ncertain.  Therefore, it is not possible to be certain your conscience is\n`properly formed'.  (Whatever that is supposed to mean.)\n\n\nMr Boundary then gives another paradigm example of the problem:\n\n\nThe Church is `by necessity' the infallible interpreter of divine revelation?\nHow do you know?  Presumably, you believe this because of some argument or\nanother -- how do you know that the argument contains no mistakes?\n\nYou write:\n\n\nBut there is a huge difference between `confidence in our ability to\ndistinguish what is true from what is not true' and `infallible'.  I am\nconfident about a lot of things, but absolute certainty is a very long way\nfrom `confident'.\n\nThis discussion is about the arrogance of claiming to be absolutely certain\n(really, go check the subject line).  Saying you are absolutely certain is\nsignificantly different than saying you are confident.  When you say that\nyou are confident, that invites people to ask why.\n\nExcept in very limited circumstances, when you say that you are absolutely\ncertain, it invites people to dismiss you as someone who does not have any\nidea of his own fallibility.\n\n\nI have yet to meet anyone who believed in a knowably-infallible source of\ntruth who would admit the possibility of errors in his reasoning.  All of\nthem -- every last one -- has claimed that he was himself infallible.\nThe result has been to convince me that they had no idea what was going on.\n\n\nDarren F Provine / kilroy@gboro.rowan.edu\n\n[This particular discussion may not be entirely relevant to the\noriginal criticism.  I get the feeling that the original poster\nregarded as arrogant the very idea that there are right and wrong\nanswers in religion, and that the difference can have eternal\nconsequences.  When I say that I think there is a hell and that he is\nat least in significant danger of ending up there, I will admit that\n-- as you say -- the reasoning processes I used to reach this are\nfallible.  Thus at least in principle I could be wrong.  But these\nbasic facts are clearly enough taught in the Bible that I think it's\nunlikely that I'm misinterpreting it.  (In order to get this level of\nconfidence, I've tried to frame my statement sufficiently carefully as\nto sidestep a number of the more controversial issues.  I haven't, for\nexample said that all non-Christians will definitely end up in hell,\nand I haven't attempted to describe hell in any detail.)  I have a\nfeeling that my view is going to be regarded as arrogant and\nintolerant even though I acknowledge that I'm fallible and so there's\nsome chance I'm wrong.\n\nDon't get me wrong -- I think there are a lot of genuinely arrogant\nChristians, and often criticism of us is justified.  But in at least\nsome cases I think the criticisms constitute blaming the messenger.\nIf the universe is set up so that there are eternal consequences for\ncertain decisions, it's not my fault -- I'm just telling it the way I\nthink it is.  You may think God is immoral for setting things up that\nway.  It's one of the critiques of Christianity that I find it most\ndifficult to respond to.  But it's not arrogance for me to tell what\nI think is the truth.","label":"soc.religion.christian"}

During the Russian occupation of Erzurum, no Armenian\n was permitted to approach the city and its environs.\n\n While the Commander of the First Army Corps, General Kaltiyin remained\n in power, troops including Armenian enlisted men, were not sent to the\n area. When the security measures were lifted, the Armenians began to \n attack Erzurum and its surroundings. Following the attacks came the\n plundering of the houses in the city and the villages and the murder\n of the owners of these houses...Plundering was widely committed by\n the soldiers. This plunder was mainly committed by Armenian soldiers\n who had remained in the rear during the war.\n\n One day, while passing through the streets on horseback, a group of\n soldiers including an Armenian soldier began to drag two old men of\n seventy years in a certain direction. The roads were covered with mud,\n and these people were dragging the two helpless Turks through the mud\n and dirt...\n\n It was understood later that all these were nothing but tricks and\n traps. The Turks who joined the gendarmarie soon changed their minds\n and withdrew. The reason was that most of the Turks who were on night\n patrol did not return, and no one knew what had happened to them. The \n Turks who had been sent outside the city for labour began to disappear\n also. Finally, the Court Martial which had been established for the\n trials of murderers and plunderers, began to liquidate itself for\n fear that they themselves would be punished. The incidents of murder\n and rape, which had decreased, began to occur more frequently.\n\n Sometime in January and February, a leading Turkish citizen Haci Bekir\n Efendi from Erzurum, was killed one night at his home. The Commander\n in Chief (Odiselidge) gave orders to find murderers within three days.\n The Commander in Chief has bitterly reminded the Armenian intellectuals\n that disobedience among the Armenian enlisted men had reached its\n highest point, that they had insulted and robbed the people and half\n of the Turks sent outside the city had not returned.\n\n ...We learnt the details this incident from the Commander-in-Chief,\n Odishelidge. They were as follows:\n\n The killings were organized by the doctors and the employers, and the\n act of killing was committed solely by the Armenian renegades...\n More than eight hundred unarmed and defenceless Turks have been\n killed in Erzincan. Large holes were dug and the defenceless \n Turks were slaughtered like animals next to the holes. Later, the\n murdered Turks were thrown into the holes. The Armenian who stood \n near the hole would say when the hole was filled with the corpses:\n 'Seventy dead bodies, well, this hole can take ten more.' Thus ten\n more Turks would be cut into pieces, thrown into the hole, and when\n the hole was full it would be covered over with soil.\n\n The Armenians responsible for the act of murdering would frequently\n fill a house with eighty Turks, and cut their heads off one by one.\n Following the Erzincan massacre, the Armenians began to withdraw\n towards Erzurum... The Armenian renegades among those who withdrew\n to Erzurum from Erzincan raided the Moslem villages on the road, and\n destroyed the entire population, together with the villages.\n\n During the transportation of the cannons, ammunition and the carriages\n that were outside the war area, certain people were hired among the \n Kurdish population to conduct the horse carriages. While the travellers\n were passing through Erzurum, the Armenians took advantage of the time\n when the Russian soldiers were in their dwellings and began to kill\n the Kurds they had hired. When the Russian soldiers heard the cries\n of the dying Kurds, they attempted to help them. However, the \n Armenians threatened the Russian soldiers by vowing that they would\n have the same fate if they intervened, and thus prevented them from\n acting. All these terrifying acts of slaughter were committed with\n hatred and loathing.\n\n Lieutenant Medivani from the Russian Army described an incident that\n he witnessed in Erzurum as follows: An Armenian had shot a Kurd. The\n Kurd fell down but did not die. The Armenian attempted to force the\n stick in his hand into the mouth of the dying Kurd. However, since\n the Kurd had firmly closed his jaws in his agony, the Armenian failed\n in his attempt. Having seen this, the Armenian ripped open the abdomen\n of the Kurd, disembowelled him, and finally killed him by stamping\n him with the iron heel of his boot.\n\n Odishelidge himself told us that all the Turks who could not escape\n from the village of Ilica were killed. Their heads had been cut off\n by axes. He also told us that he had seen thousands of murdered\n children. Lieutenant Colonel Gryaznov, who passed through the village\n of Ilica, three weeks after the massacre told us the following:\n\n There were thousands of dead bodies hacked to pieces, on the roads.\n Every Armenian who happened to pass through these roads, cursed and\n spat on the corpses. In the courtyard of a mosque which was about\n 25x30 meter square, dead bodies were piled to a height of 140 \n centimeters. Among these corpses were men and women of every age,\n children and old people. The women's bodies had obvious marks of\n rape. The genitals of many girls were filled with gun-powder.\n\n A few educated Armenian girls, who worked as telephone operators\n for the Armenian troops were called by Lieutenant Colonel Gryaznov\n to the courtyard of the mosque and he bitterly told them to be \n proud of what the Armenians had done. To the lieutenant colonel's\n disgusted amazement, the Armenian girls started to laugh and giggle,\n instead of being horrified. The lieutenant colonel had severely\n reprimanded those girls for their indecent behaviour. When he told\n the girls that the Armenians, including women, were generally more\n licentious than even the wildest animals, and that their indecent\n and shameful laughter was the most obvious evidence of their inhumanity\n and barbarity, before a scene that appalled even veteran soldiers,\n the Armenian girls finally remembered their sense of shame and\n claimed they had laughed because they were nervous.\n\n An Armenian contractor at the Alaca Communication zone command\n narrated the following incident which took place on February 20:\n\n The Armenians had nailed a Turkish women to the wall. They had cut\n out the women's heart and placed the heart on top of her head.\n The great massacre in Erzurum began on February 7... The enlisted men \n of the artillery division caught and stripped 270 people. Then they\n took these people into the bath to satisfy their lusts. 100 people\n among this group were able to save their lives as the result of\n my decisive attempts. The others, the Armenians claimed, were \n released when they learnt that I understood what was going on. \n Among those who organized this treacherous act was the envoy to the\n Armenian officers, Karagodaviev. Today, some Turks were murdered\n on the streets.\n\n On February 12, some Armenians have shot more than ten innocent\n Moslems. The Russian soldiers who attempted to save these people were\n threatened with death. Meanwhile I imprisoned an Armenian for\n murdering an innocent Turk. \n\n When an Armenian officer told an Armenian murderer that he would \n be hanged for his crime, the killer shouted furiously: 'How dare\n you hang an Armenian for killing a Turk?' In Erzurum, the \n Armenians burned down the Turkish market. On February 17, I heard\n that the entire population of Tepekoy village, situated within\n the artillery area, had been totally annihilated. On the same \n day when Antranik entered Erzurum, I reported the massacre to\n him, and asked him to track down the perpetrators of this horrible\n act. However no result was achieved.\n\n In the villages whose inhabitants had been massacred, there was a\n natural silence. On the night of 26/27 February, the Armenians deceived\n the Russians, perpetrated a massacre and escaped for fear of the \n Turkish soldiers. Later, it was understood that this massacre had\n been based upon a method organized and planned in a circular. \n The population had been herded in a certain place and then killed\n one by one. The number of murders committed on that night reached\n three thousand. It was the Armenians who bragged to about the details\n of the massacre. The Armenians fighting against the Turkish soldiers\n were so few in number and so cowardly that they could not even\n withstand the Turkish soldiers who consisted of only five hundred\n people and two cannons, for one night, and ran away. The leading\n Armenians of the community could have prevented this massacre.\n However, the Armenian intellectuals had shared the same ideas with\n the renegades in this massacre, just as in all the others. The lower\n classes within the Armenian community have always obeyed the orders\n of the leading Armenian figures and commanders. \n\n I do not like to give the impression that all Armenian intellectuals\n were accessories to these murders. No, for there were people who\n opposed the Armenians for such actions, since they understood that\n it would yield no result. However, such people were only a minority.\n Furthermore, such people were considered as traitors to the Armenian\n cause. Some have seemingly opposed the Armenian murders but have\n supported the massacres secretly. Some, on the other hand, preferred\n to remain silent. There were certain others, who, when accused by\n the Russians of infamy, would say the following: 'You are Russians.\n You can never understand the Armenian cause.' The Armenians had a\n conscience. They would commit massacres and then would flee in fear\n of the Turkish soldiers.\"\n\n\nSerdar Argic","label":"talk.politics.mideast"}

It is surprising to note that a large majority of\npeople, at least in Finland, seem to be apatheists - even though\n90 % of the population are members of the Lutheran Church of Finland,\nreligious people are actually a minority. \n\nCould it be possible that many people believe in god \"just in case\"?\nIt seems people do not want to seek the truth; they fall prey to Pascal's\nWager or other poor arguments. A small minority of those who do believe\nreads the Bible regularly. The majority doesn't care - it believes,\nbut doesn't know what or how. \n\nPeople don't usually allow their beliefs to change their lifestyle,\nthey only want to keep the virtual gate open. A Christian would say\nthat they are not \"born in the Spirit\", but this does not disturb them.\nReligion is not something to think about. \n\nI'm afraid a society with a true atheist majority is an impossible\ndream. Religions have a strong appeal to people, nevertheless - \na promise of life after death is something humans eagerly listen to.\nCoupled with threats of eternal torture and the idea that our\nmorality is under constant scrutiny of some cosmic cop, too many\npeople take the poison with a smile. Or just pretend to swallow\n(and unconsciously hope god wouldn't notice ;-) )\n\n: Also, how many atheists out there would actually take the stance and accor a\n: higher value to their way of thinking over the theistic way of thinking.  The\n: typical selfish argument would be that both lines of thinking evolved from the\n: same inherent motivation, so one is not, intrinsically, different from the\n: other, qualitatively.  But then again a measuring stick must be drawn\n: somewhere, and if we cannot assign value to a system of beliefs at its core,\n: than the only other alternative is to apply it to its periphery; ie, how it\n: expresses its own selfishness.\n\nIf logic and reason are valued, then I would claim that atheistic thinking\nis of higher value than the theistic exposition. Theists make unnecessary\nassumptions they believe in - I've yet to see good reasons to believe\nin gods, or to take a leap of faith at all. A revelation would do.\n\nHowever, why do we value logic and reasoning? This questions bears\nsome resemblance to a long-disputed problem in science: why mathematics\nworks? Strong deep structuralists, like Atkins, have proposed that\nperhaps, after all, everything _is_ mathematics. \n\nIs usefulness any criterion?\n\nPetri\n","label":"alt.atheism"}

Denying the obvious?\n\n\nSource: Hovannisian, Richard G.: Armenia on the Road to Independence, 1918.\nUniversity of California Press (Berkeley and Los Angeles), 1967, p. 13.\n\n\"The addition of the Kars and Batum oblasts to the Empire increased the\n area of Transcaucasia to over 130,000 square miles. The estimated population\n of the entire region in 1886 was 4,700,000, of whom 940,000 (20 percent) were\n Armenian, 1,200,000 (25 percent) Georgian, and 2,220,000 (45 percent) Moslem.\n Of the latter group, 1,140,000 were Tatars. Paradoxically, barely one-third\n of Transcaucasia's Armenians lived in the Erevan guberniia, where the \n Christians constituted a majority in only three of the seven uezds. Erevan\n uezd, the administrative center of the province, had only 44,000 Armenians\n as compared to 68,000 Moslems. By the time of the Russian Census of 1897,\n however, the Armenians had established a scant majority, 53 percent, in the\n guberniia; it had risen by 1916 to 60 percent, or 670,000 of the 1,120,000\n inhabitants. This impressive change in the province's ethnic character \n notwithstanding, there was, on the eve of the creation of the Armenian \n Republic, a solid block of 370,000 Tartars who continued to dominate the \n southern districts, from the outskirts of Ereven to the border of Persia.\" \n (See also Map 1.

Our troops surrounded village after village. \n Little resistance was offered. Our artillery knocked the huts \n into heaps of stone and dust and when the villages became untenable \n and inhabitants fled from them into fields, bullets and bayonets \n completed the work. Some of the Tartars escaped of course. They \n found refuge in the mountains or succeeded in crossing the border \n into Turkey. The rest were killed. And so it is that the whole \n length of the borderland of Russian Armenia from Nakhitchevan to \n Akhalkalaki from the hot plains of Ararat to the cold mountain \n plateau of the North were dotted with mute mournful ruins of \n Tartar villages.

{"text":"Classify the following data: All of the arguments concerning the Sabbath ought to make the point\npretty clear - anyone outside of the Catholic or Orthodox orAnglican or\nMonophysite churches ourght to worship on Saturday if they are really\nsola scriptura.

The argument against the Sabbath is\nthat it is part of the ceremonial law, and like the rest of the\nceremonial law is not binding on Christians.  This argument is based\non Paul's letters, Acts, and in a more general sense, Jesus'\nteachings.  Further, most people argue that Scripture shows worship\noccuring on Sunday, and Paul endorsing it.  I understand that these\npoints are disputed, and do not want to go around the dispute one more\ntime.  The point I'm making here is not that these arguments are\nright, but that the backing they claim is Scripture.\n\nAccepting the principle of \"sola scriptura\" does not commit us to\nobeying the entire Jewish Law.  Acts 15 and Paul's letters are quite\nclear on that.  I think even the SDA's accept it.  The disagreement is\non where the Bible would have us place the line.\n\nBy the way, Protestants do give authority to the church, in matters\nthat are not dictated by God.  That's why churches are free to\ndetermine their own liturgies, church polity, etc.  If you accept that\nthe Sabbath is not binding on Christians, then the day of worship\nfalls into the category of items on which individual Christians or\n(since worship is by its nature a group activity) churches are free to\ndecide.","label":"soc.religion.christian"}

And, the\nproposed scheme *is* a major improvement in telephone security to what\nexists now.\n \n   The problem is that, with any security scheme of this kind, you have to\nconcern yourself with the weakest link in the chain.  I suspect that NSA\nhas put a fairly strong encryption algorithm in this wiretap chip of theirs,\nprobably at least as strong as (say) DES in OFB-mode.  Unfortunately, the\nexistence of the key-registry system seems to make possible all kinds of\npossible attacks at a small fraction of the expense of trying to build (say)\na DES keysearch machine.\n \n   As originally described, it sounded like any police / court combination\ncould acquire the key for a given chip.

{"text":"Classify the following data: In an earlier article, I explained that what many people find arrogant about\nChristians is that some Christians profess absolute certianty about their\nbeliefs and doctrines.  That is, many Christians insist that they CANNOT have\nmade any mistakes when discovering their beliefs, which amounts to saying\nthat they are infallible.\n\nImpicitly claiming to be infallible is pretty arrogant, most of us will\nprobably agree.\n\nIn short, the problem is that no matter how good your sources are, if any\npart of your doctrines or beliefs rest on your own thinking and reasoning,\nthen those doctrines are suspect.  So long as your own brain is involved,\nthere is a possibility for error.  I summarised the problem by writing \"There\nis no way out of the loop.\"\n\n\nSomeone called `REXLEX' has claimed that there IS a way out of the loop, but\nhe did not bother to explain what it was, preferring instead to paraphrase\nSartre, ramble about Wittgenstein, and say that the conclusion of my argument\nleads to relativism.\n\nAs I have explained to him before, you cannot reject an argument as false\nbecause you dislike where it leads: the facts do not change just because\n\n\nHowever, as any first-year philosophy student can explain, what `REXLEX' has\nwritten does not constitute a refutation.  All he has said is that he does\nnot like what I wrote -- he has done nothing at all to dispute it.\n\n *\n\nThere were two sentences in `REXLEX's post that seemed relevant to the\npoint at hand:\n\n\nI do not dispute that some truths can be verified through experience.  I\nhave, for example, direct experience of adding numbers.  I don't claim to\nbe infallible at it -- in fact I remember doing sums incorrectly -- but I\ndo claim that I have direct experience of reasoning about numbers.\n\nHowever, once we go past experiencing things and start reasoning about\nthem, we are on much shakier ground.  That was the point of the earlier\narticle.  Human brains are infested with sin, and they can only be trusted\nin very limited circumstances.\n\n\n\nBut how far does that get you?  Once God's revelation stops, and your own\nreasoning begins, possibility for error appears.\n\nFor example, let's suppose that our modern Bible translations include a\nperfect rendering of Jesus words at the Last Supper, and that Jesus said,\nexactly, \"This is my body.\"\n\nWe'll presume that what he said was totally without error and absolutely\ntrue.  What can we be certain of?  Not much.\n\nAt the moment he stops speaking, and people start interpreting, the\npossibility of error appears.  Did he mean that literally or not?  We do\nnot have any record that he elaborated on the words.  Was he thinking of\nTran- or Con- substatiation?   He didn't say.  We interpret this passage\nusing our brains; we think and reason and draw conclusions.  But we know\nthat our brains are not perfect: our thinking often leads us wrong.  (This\nis something that most of us have direct experience of.  8-)\n\nWhy should anyone believe that his reasoning -- which he knows to be\nfallible -- can lead him to perfect conclusions?\n\nSo, given the assumptions in this example, what we can be certain of is\nthat Jesus said \"This is my body.\"  Beyond that, once we start making up\ndoctrines and using our brains to reason about what Christ revealed, we\nget into trouble.\n\nUnless you are infallible, there are very few things you can be certain\nof.  To the extent that doctrines rely on fallible human thinking, they\ncannot be certain.\n\n\n\nThat is the problem of seeming arrogant.  The non-Christians around us know\nthat human beings make mistakes, just as surely as we know it.  They do not\nbelieve we are infallible, any more than we do.\n\nWhen Christians speak as if they believe their own reasoning can never lead\nthem astray -- when we implicitly claim that we are infallible -- the non-\nChristians around us rarely believe that implicit claim.  Witnessing is\nhardly going to work when the person you are talking to believes that you\nare either too foolish to recognise your own limits, or intentionally trying\nto cover them up.\n\nI think it would be far better to say what things we are certain of and what\nthings we are only \"very confident\" of.  For example, we might say that we\nknow our sin, for recognising sin is something we directly experience.  But\nother things, whether based on reasoning from Scripture or extra-Biblical\nthinking, should not be labled as infallible: we should say that we are\nvery confident of them, and be ready to explain our reasoning.\n\nBut, so far as I am aware, none of us is infallible -- speaking or acting\nas if our thinking is flawless is ridiculous.\n\n *\n\n`REXLEX' suggested that people read _He is There and He is Not Silent_, by\nFrancis Schaeffer.  I didn't think very highly of it, but I think that\nMr Schaeffer is grossly overrated by many Evangelical Christians.  Somebody\nelse might like it, though, so don't let my opinion stop you from reading it.\n\nIf someone is interested in my opinion, I'd suggest _On Certainty_, by\nLudwig Wittgenstein.\n","label":"soc.religion.christian"}
{"text":"Classify the following data: Government-Mandated Energy Conservation is Unnecessary and Wastful, Study Finds\n\n  Washington, DC -- The energy tax and subsidized energy-efficiency\n  measures supported by President Clinton and Energy Secretary Hazel\n  O'Leary are based on faulty assumptions, a new study from the Cato\n  Institute points out.\n\n    According to Jerry Taylor, Cato's director of natural resource studies,\n  we are not running out of sources of energy. The world now has almost 10\n  times the proven oil reserves it had in 1950 and twice the reserves of\n  1970. Proven reserves of coal and natural gas have increased just as\n  dramatically.\n\n    When standards of living, population densities, and industrial\n  structures are controlled for, the United States is no less energy\n  efficient than Japan and more energy efficient than many of the Group\n  of Seven nations.\n\n    Energy independence provides little protection against domestic oil\n  price shocks because the energy economy is global. Moreover, since the\n  cost of oil represents only about 2 percent of gross national product,\n  even large increases in the price of oil would have little impact on the\n  overall U.S. economy.\n\n    Market economies are, on average, 2.75 times more energy efficient per\n  $1,000 of GNP than are centrally planned economies.\n\n    Utilities' subsidized energy-efficiency measurs, known as demand-side\n  management programs, encourage free riders, overuse of competing resource\n  inputs, an competitive inequities. Furthermore, DSM programs do not\n  reduce demand.\n\n    Taylor concludes that government-mandated energy conservation imposes\n  unnecessary costs on consumers and wastes, not conserves, energy; that\n  subsidizing energy-conservation technologies will stymie, not advance,\n  gains in energy conservation; and that central control over the lifeblood\n  of modern society--energy--would transfer tremendous power to the state\n  at the expense of the individual.\n\n    \"Energy Conservation and Efficiency: The Case Against Coercion\" is no.\n  189 in the Policy Analysis series published by the Cato Institute, an\n  independent public policy research organization in Washington, DC.\n\n\n\nAvailable from:\n  Cato Institute\n  224 Second Street SE\n  Washington, DC  20003\n\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\n\n                        The Cato Institute\n\n    Founded in 1977, the Cato Institute is a public policy research\n  foundation dedicated to broadening the parameters of policy debate\n  to allow consideration of more options that are consistent with the\n  traditional American principles of limited government, individual\n  liberty, and peace.  To that end, the Institute strives to achieve\n  greater involvement of the intelligent, concerned lay public in \n  questions of policy and the proper role of government.\n    The Institute is named for Cato's Letters, libertarian pamphlets\n  that were widely read in the American Colonies in the early 18th\n  century and played a major role in laying the philosophical foundation\n  of the American Revolution.\n    Despite the achievement of the nation's Founders, today virtually\n  no aspect of life is free from government encroachment.  A pervasive\n  intolerance for individual rights is shown by government's arbitrary\n  intrusions into private economic transactions and its disregard for\n  civil liberties.\n    To counter that trend the Cato Institute undertakes an extensive\n  publications program that addresses the complete spectrum of policy\n  issues.  Books, monographs, and shorter studies are commissioned\n  to examine the federal budget, Social Security, regulation, military\n  spending, international trade, and myriad other issues.  Major policy\n  conferences are held throughout the year, from which papers are\n  published thrice yearly in the Cato Journal.\n    In order to maintain its independence, the Cato Institute accepts\n  no government funding.

Am I mistaken with this understanding?\n\n= But if you claim that there must be\n= an answer to \"how\" did the universe (our spacetime)  emerge from \n= \"nothing\", science has some good candidates for an answer.\n\nAll of which require something we Christians readily admit to: ``Faith''.\n\nThe fact that there are several candidates belies that *none* are conclusive.  \nWith out conclusive evidence, we are left with faith.\n\nIt could even be argued that one of these hypotheses may one day be proven (as\nbest as a non-repeatable event can be \"proven\").  But I ask, what holds  \nsomeone *today* to the belief that any or all of them are correct, except by \nfaith?\n\n[ a couple of paragraphs deleted.  Summary: we ask \"Why does the\nuniverse exist\" ]\n\n= I think this question should actually be split into two parts, namely\n= \n= 1) Why is there existence? Why anything exists?\n= \n= and\n= \n= 2) How did the universe emerge from nothing?\n= \n= It is clear science has nothing to say about the first question. However,\n= is it a meaningful question, after all?\n=\n= I would say it isn't. Consider the following:\n\nApparently it *is* for many persons.  Hence, we *have* religions.\n\n= The question \"why anything exists\" can be countered by\n= demanding answer to a question \"why there is nothing in nothingness,\n= or in non-existence\".  Actually, both questions turn out to be\n= devoid of meaning. Things that exist do, and things that don't exist\n= don't exist. Tautology at its best.\n\nCarefully examine the original question, and then the \"counter-question\". \nThe first asks \"Why\", while the second is a request for definition.  It \ndoesn't address why something does or does not exist, but asks to define \nthe lack of existence.  The second question is unanswerable indeed, for\nhow do we identify something as \"nothing\" (aren't they mutually exclusive\nterms)?.  How do we identify a state of non-existence (again, this is\nnearing the limits of this simple layman's ability to comprehend, and I\nwould appreciate an explanation). \n\nI might add, the worldview of \"Things that exist do, and things that\ndon't...don't\" is as grounded in the realm of the non-falsifiable,\nas does the theist's belief in God.  It is based on the assumption\nthat there is *not* a reason for being, something as ultimately\n(un)supportable as the position of there being a reason.  Its very\nfoundation exists in the same soil as that of one who claims there *is* a\nreason.\n\nWe come to this. Either \"I am, therefore I am.\", or \"I am for a reason.\"\nIf the former is a satisfactory answer, then you are done, for you are\nsatisfied, and need not a doctor.  If the latter, your search is just\nbeginning.  \n\n= I seriously doubt God could have an answer to this question.\n\nTime will tell. 8^)\n\n= \n= Some Christians I have talked to have said that actually, God is\n= Himself the existence. However, I see several problems with this\n= answer. First, it inevitably leads to the conclusion that God is\n= actually _all_ existence, good and evil, devils and angels, us and\n= them. This is pantheism, not Christianity.\n\nAgreed.  It would lead me to question their definition of Christianity as\nwell.\n\n= Another answer is that God is the _source_ of all existence.\n= This sounds much better, but I am tempted to ask: Does God\n= Himself exist, then? If God is the source of His own existence,\n= it can only mean that He has, in terms of human time, always\n= existed. But this is not the same as the source of all existence.\n\nThis does not preclude His existence.  It only seeks to identify His\n*qualities* (implying He exists to *have* qualities, BTW).\n\n= The best answer I have heard is that human reasoning is incapable\n= of understanding such questions. Being an atheist myself, I do not\n= accept such answers, since I do not have any other methods.\n\nLike the theist, we come to a statement of faith, for this position assumes \nthat the evidence at hand is conclusive.  Note, I am not arguing against \nscientific endeavor, for science is useful for understanding the universe in\nwhich we exist. But I differ from the atheist in a matter of perspective.  I\nseek to understand what exists to understand and appreciate the art of the\nCreator.\n\nI also have discovered science is an inadequate tool to answer \"why\".   It\nappears that M. Pihko agrees (as we shall see).  But because a tool is\ninadequate to answer a question does not preclude the question.  Asserting\nthat 'why' is an invalid question does not provide an answer.  \n\n= : As far as I can tell, the very laws of nature demand a \"why\".  That isn't\n= : true of something outside of nature (i.e., *super*natural).\n= \n= This is not true. Science is a collection of models telling us \"how\",\n= not why, something happens. I cannot see any good reason why the \"why\"\n= questions would be bound only to natural things, assuming that the\n= supernatural domain exists. If supernatural beings exist, it is\n= as appropriate to ask why they do so as it is to ask why we exist.\n\nMy apologies.  I was using why as \"why did this come to be\".  Why did\npre-existence become existence.  Why did pre-spacetime become spacetime.\n\nBut we come to the admission that science fails to answer \"Why?\".  Because\nit can't be answered in the realm of modern science, does that make the\nquestion invalid?\n= : I don't believe *any*\n= : technology would be able to produce that necessary *spark* of life, despite\n= : having all of the parts available. Just my opinion.\n= \n= This opinion is also called vitalism; namely, that living systems are\n= somehow _fundamentally_ different from inanimate systems. Do Christians\n= in general adopt this position? What would happen when scientists announce\n= they have created primitive life (say, small bacteria) in a lab?\n\nI suppose we would do the same thing as when Galileo or Capernicus was \n*vindicated*  (before someone starts jumping up and down screaming\n\"Inquisition!\", note I said *vindicated*.  I certainly hope we've gotten\nbeyond the \"shooting the messenger\" stage).\n\nM. Pihko does present a good point though.  We may need to ask \"What do I \nas an individual Christian base my faith on?\"  Will it be shaken by the\nproduction of evidence that shatters our \"sacred cows\" or will we seek to\nunderstand if a new discovery truly disagrees with what God *said* (and\ncontinues to say) in his Word?\n\n\"Why do I ask why?\" (apologies to Budweiser and company 8^]).\n\nJason.\n\n\n","label":"soc.religion.christian"}

{"text":"Classify the following data: Sixteen days I had put off test driving the Honda ST1100.  Finally,\nthe 17th was a Saturday without much rain.  In fact it cleared up, \nbecame warm and sunny, and the wind died.  About three weeks ago, I\ntook a long cool ride on the Hawk down to Cycles! 128 for a test ride.\nThey had sold, and delivered, the demo ST1100 about fifteen hours\nbefore I arrived.  And the demo VFR was bike-locked in the showroom --\nsurrounded by 150 other bikes, and not likely to move soon.\n\nToday was different.  There were even more bikes.  50 used dirt bikes,\n50 used street bikes, 35 cars, and a big tent full of Outlandishly Fat\nTouring Bikes With Trailers were all squeezed in the parking lot.\nSome sort of fat bike convention.  Shelly and Dave were running one\nMSF course each, at the same time.  One in the classroom and one on\nthe back lot.  Plus, there was the usuall free cookout food that\nCycles! gives away every weekend in the summer.  Hmmm, it seemed like\na big moto party.\n\nAfter about ten minutes of looking for Rob C, cheif of sales slime,\nand another 5 minutes reading and signing a long disclosure/libility/\npray-to-god form I helped JT push the ST out into the mess in the\nparking lot.  We went over the the controls, I put the tank bag from \nthe Hawk into the right saddlebag, and my wife put everything else\ninto the left saddlebag.  ( Thats nice.... )  Having helped push the \nST out to the lot, I thought it best to have JT move it to the edge of\nthe road, away from the 100+ bikes and 100+ people.  He rode it like a\nbicycle!  'It cant be that heavy' I thought.\n\nWell I was wrong.  As I sat on the ST, both feet down, all I could \nthink was \"big\".  Then I put one foot up.  \"Heavy\" came to mind very\nquickly.  With Cindy on the back -- was she on the back?  Hard to \ntell with seat three times as large as a Hawk seat -- the bike seemed\nnearly out of control just idling on the side of the road.\n\nBy 3000 rpm in second gear, all the weight seemed to dissappear.  Even\non bike with 4.1 miles on the odometer, slippery new tires, and pads that \ndid not yet bite the disks, things seems smooth and sure.  Cycles! is\non a section of 128 that few folks ever ride.  About 30 miles north\nof the computer concentration, about five miles north of where I95\nsplits away, 128 is a lighly travelled, two lane limited access\nhighway.  It goes through heavily forested sections of Hamilton, \nManchester-by-the-Sea and Newbury on its way to Gloucester.\nOn its way there, it meets 133, a road that winds from the sea about\n30 miles inland to Andover.  On its way it goes through many\nthoroughly New England spots.  Perfect, if slow, sport touring sections.\n\nCindy has no difficulty with speed.  3rd gear, 4th gear, purring along\nin top gear.  This thing has less low rpm grunt that my Hawk.  Lane \nchanges were a new experience.  A big heft is required to move this \nthing.  Responds well though.   No wallowing or complaint.  Behind the\nfairing it was fairly quiet, but the helmet buffeting was\nnon-trivial.  Top gear car passing at 85mph was nearly effortless.\nSmooth, smooth, smooth.   Not sure what the v4 sound reminds me of,\nbut it is pleasant.  If only the bars were not transmitting an endless\nbuzz.\n\nThe jump on to 133 caused me to be less than impressed with the\nbrakes.  Its a down hill, reversing camber, twice-reversing radius,\ndecreasing radius turn.  A real squeeze is needed on the front binder.  \nThe section of 133 we were on was tight, but too urban.  The ST works ok\nin this section, but it shows its weight.  We went by the clam shack\noft featured in \"Spencer for Hire\" -- a place where you could really \nfind \"Spencer\", his house was about 15 miles down 133.  After putting\nthrough traffic for a while, we turned and went back to 128.\n\nAbout half way through the onramp, I yanked Cindy's wrist, our singal\nfor \"hold on tight\".  Head check left,  time to find redline.  Second\ngear gives a good shove.  Third too.  Fourth sees DoD speed with a \nshort shift into top.  On the way to 133 we saw no cops and very light\ntraffic.  Did not cross into DoD zone because the bike was too new.\nWell, now it had 25 miles on it, so it was ok.  Tried some high effort\nlane changes, some wide sweeping turns.  Time to wick it up?  I went \nuntil the buffeting was threating to pull us off the seat.  And stayed\nthere.  When I was comfortable with the wind and the steering, \nI looked down to find an indicated 135mph.  Not bad for 2-up touring.\n\nBeverly comes fast at more than twice the posted limit.  At the \"get\noff in a mile\" sign, I rolled off the throttle and coasted.  I wanted\nto re-adjust to the coming slowness.  It was a good idea:  there were\nseveral manhole-sized patches of sand on the exit ramp.  Back to the \nslow and heavy behavior.  Cycles! is about a mile from 128.  I could \nsee even more cars stacked up outside right when I got off.  I managed\nto thread the ST through the cars to the edge of the concrete pad\nout front.  Heavy.  It took way too much effort for Cindy and I to put\nthe thing on the center stand.  I am sure that if I used the side\nstand the ST would have been on its side within a minute.\n\n\nMy demo opinion?  Heavy.  Put it on a diet.  Smooth, comfortable,\nhardly notices the DoD speed.   I'd buy on for about $3000 less than \nlist, just like it is.  Too much $ for the bike as it is.","label":"rec.motorcycles"}

{"text":"Classify the following data: [reply to zazen@austin.ibm.com (E. H. Welbon)]\n \n \n \n \nFor many atheists, the lack of belief in gods is secondary to an\nepistemological consideration:  what do we accept as a reliable way of\nknowing?  There are no known valid logical arguments for the existence\nof gods, nor is there any empirical evidence that they exist.  Most\nphilosophers and theologians agree that the idea of a god is one that\nmust be accepted on faith.  Faith is belief without a sound logical\nbasis or empirical evidence.  It is a reliable way of knowing?\n \nThere is probably nothing else most people would accept in the absence\nof any possibility of proof.  Even when we agree to take someone elses\nword \"on faith\", we just mean that having found this person to be\nreliable in the past, we judge him likely to be a reliable source now.\nIf we find faith less reliable than logic and empirical evidence\neverywhere else, why assume it will provide reliable knowledge about\ngods?\n \nThe difference between the atheist and the theist is fundamentally then\none of whether or not faith is held to be a reliable way of knowing,\nrather than, as some agnostic posters would have it, whether ones faith\nis in gods or no gods.  The theist believes that faith is an acceptable\nbasis for a belief in gods, even if he rejects faith as reliable at\nother times, for example in his work as a scientist.  The atheist\nbelieves that only logic and empirical evidence lead to reliable\nknowledge.  Agnosticism seems to me a less defensible position than\ntheism or atheism, unless one is a sceptic in regards to all other\nknowledge.  Without evidence, why should we believe in gods rather than\nSanta Claus or the Easter Bunny?\n \nI would also like to point out as others have that the atheist doesn't\nrequire absolute knowledge of the lack of gods.  I don't believe that\nthere is any such thing as absolute knowledge.  Atheism is the best and\nsimplest theory to fit the (lack of) facts and so should be held until\ncontrary evidence is found.","label":"alt.atheism"}

JPEG is designed for compressing either\nfull-color or gray-scale digital images of \"natural\", real-world scenes.\nIt does not work so well on non-realistic images, such as cartoons or line\ndrawings.\n\nJPEG does not handle black-and-white (1-bit-per-pixel) images, nor does it\nhandle motion picture compression.  Standards for compressing those types\nof images are being worked on by other committees, named JBIG and MPEG\nrespectively.\n\nJPEG is \"lossy\", meaning that the image you get out of decompression isn't\nquite identical to what you originally put in.  The algorithm achieves much\nof its compression by exploiting known limitations of the human eye, notably\nthe fact that small color details aren't perceived as well as small details\nof light-and-dark.  Thus, JPEG is intended for compressing images that will\nbe looked at by humans.  If you plan to machine-analyze your images, the\nsmall errors introduced by JPEG may be a problem for you, even if they are\ninvisible to the eye.\n\nA useful property of JPEG is that the degree of lossiness can be varied by\nadjusting compression parameters.  This means that the image maker can trade\noff file size against output image quality.  You can make *extremely* small\nfiles if you don't mind poor quality; this is useful for indexing image\narchives, making thumbnail views or icons, etc. etc.  Conversely, if you\naren't happy with the output quality at the default compression setting, you\ncan jack up the quality until you are satisfied, and accept lesser compression.\n\n\n[2]  Why use JPEG?\n\nThere are two good reasons: to make your image files smaller, and to store\n24-bit-per-pixel color data instead of 8-bit-per-pixel data.\n\nMaking image files smaller is a big win for transmitting files across\nnetworks and for archiving libraries of images.  Being able to compress a\n2 Mbyte full-color file down to 100 Kbytes or so makes a big difference in\ndisk space and transmission time!  (If you are comparing GIF and JPEG, the\nsize ratio is more like four to one.  More details below.)\n\nIf your viewing software doesn't support JPEG directly, you'll have to\nconvert JPEG to some other format for viewing or manipulating images.  Even\nwith a JPEG-capable viewer, it takes longer to decode and view a JPEG image\nthan to view an image of a simpler format (GIF, for instance).  Thus, using\nJPEG is essentially a time/space tradeoff: you give up some time in order to\nstore or transmit an image more cheaply.\n\nIt's worth noting that when network or phone transmission is involved, the\ntime savings from transferring a shorter file can be much greater than the\nextra time to decompress the file.  I'll let you do the arithmetic yourself.\n\nThe other reason why JPEG will gradually replace GIF as a standard Usenet\nposting format is that JPEG can store full color information: 24 bits/pixel\n(16 million colors) instead of 8 or less (256 or fewer colors).  If you have\nonly 8-bit display hardware then this may not seem like much of an advantage\nto you.  Within a couple of years, though, 8-bit GIF will look as obsolete as\nblack-and-white MacPaint format does today.  Furthermore, for reasons detailed\nin section 7, JPEG is far more useful than GIF for exchanging images among\npeople with widely varying color display hardware.  Hence JPEG is considerably\nmore appropriate than GIF for use as a Usenet posting standard.\n\n\n[3]  When should I use JPEG, and when should I stick with GIF?\n\nJPEG is *not* going to displace GIF entirely; for some types of images,\nGIF is superior in image quality, file size, or both.  One of the first\nthings to learn about JPEG is which kinds of images to apply it to.\n\nAs a rule of thumb, JPEG is superior to GIF for storing full-color or\ngray-scale images of \"realistic\" scenes; that means scanned photographs and\nsimilar material.  JPEG is superior even if you don't have 24-bit display\nhardware, and it is a LOT superior if you do.  (See section 7 for details.)\n\nGIF does significantly better on images with only a few distinct colors,\nsuch as cartoons and line drawings.  In particular, large areas of pixels\nthat are all *exactly* the same color are compressed very efficiently indeed\nby GIF.  JPEG can't squeeze these files as much as GIF does without\nintroducing visible defects.  This sort of image is best kept in GIF form.\n(In particular, single-color borders are quite cheap in GIF files, but they\nshould be avoided in JPEG files.)\n\nJPEG also has a hard time with very sharp edges: a row of pure-black pixels\nadjacent to a row of pure-white pixels, for example.  Sharp edges tend to\ncome out blurred unless you use a very high quality setting.  Again, this\nsort of thing is not found in scanned photographs, but it shows up fairly\noften in GIF files: borders, overlaid text, etc.  The blurriness is\nparticularly objectionable with text that's only a few pixels high.\nIf you have a GIF with a lot of small-size overlaid text, don't JPEG it.\n\nComputer-drawn images (ray-traced scenes, for instance) usually fall between\nscanned images and cartoons in terms of complexity.  The more complex and\nsubtly rendered the image, the more likely that JPEG will do well on it.\nThe same goes for semi-realistic artwork (fantasy drawings and such).\n\nPlain black-and-white (two level) images should never be converted to JPEG.\nYou need at least about 16 gray levels before JPEG is useful for gray-scale\nimages.  It should also be noted that GIF is lossless for gray-scale images\nof up to 256 levels, while JPEG is not.\n\nIf you have an existing library of GIF images, you may wonder whether you\nshould convert them to JPEG.  You will lose a little image quality if you do.\n(Section 7, which argues that JPEG image quality is superior to GIF, only\napplies if both formats start from a full-color original.  If you start from\na GIF, you've already irretrievably lost a great deal of information; JPEG\ncan only make things worse.)  However, the disk space savings may justify\nconverting anyway.  This is a decision you'll have to make for yourself.\nIf you do convert a GIF library to JPEG, see section 14 for hints.  Be\nprepared to leave some images in GIF format, since some GIFs will not\nconvert well.\n\n\n[4]  How well does JPEG compress images?\n\nPretty darn well.  Here are some sample file sizes for an image I have\nhandy, a 727x525 full-color image of a ship in a harbor.  The first three\nfiles are for comparison purposes; the rest were created with the free JPEG\nsoftware described in section 6B.\n\nFile\t   Size in bytes\t\tComments\n\nship.ppm\t1145040  Original file in PPM format (no compression; 24 bits\n\t\t\t or 3 bytes per pixel, plus a few bytes overhead)\nship.ppm.Z\t 963829  PPM file passed through Unix compress\n\t\t\t compress doesn't accomplish a lot, you'll note.\n\t\t\t Other text-oriented compressors give similar results.\nship.gif\t 240438  Converted to GIF with ppmquant -fs 256 | ppmtogif\n\t\t\t Most of the savings is the result of losing color\n\t\t\t info: GIF saves 8 bits/pixel, not 24.  (See sec. 7.)\n\nship.jpg95\t 155622  cjpeg -Q 95    (highest useful quality setting)\n\t\t\t This is indistinguishable from the 24-bit original,\n\t\t\t at least to my nonprofessional eyeballs.\nship.jpg75\t  58009  cjpeg -Q 75    (default setting)\n\t\t\t You have to look mighty darn close to distinguish this\n\t\t\t from the original, even with both on-screen at once.\nship.jpg50\t  38406  cjpeg -Q 50\n\t\t\t This has slight defects; if you know what to look\n\t\t\t for, you could tell it's been JPEGed without seeing\n\t\t\t the original.  Still as good image quality as many\n\t\t\t recent postings in Usenet pictures groups.\nship.jpg25\t  25192  cjpeg -Q 25\n\t\t\t JPEG's characteristic \"blockiness\" becomes apparent\n\t\t\t at this setting (djpeg -blocksmooth helps some).\n\t\t\t Still, I've seen plenty of Usenet postings that were\n\t\t\t of poorer image quality than this.\nship.jpg5o\t   6587  cjpeg -Q 5 -optimize  (-optimize cuts table overhead)\n\t\t\t Blocky, but perfectly satisfactory for preview or\n\t\t\t indexing purposes.  Note that this file is TINY:\n\t\t\t the compression ratio from the original is 173:1 !\n\nIn this case JPEG can make a file that's a factor of four or five smaller\nthan a GIF of comparable quality (the -Q 75 file is every bit as good as the\nGIF, better if you have a full-color display).  This seems to be a typical\nratio for real-world scenes.\n\n\n[5]  What are good \"quality\" settings for JPEG?\n\nMost JPEG compressors let you pick a file size vs. image quality tradeoff by\nselecting a quality setting.  There seems to be widespread confusion about\nthe meaning of these settings.  \"Quality 95\" does NOT mean \"keep 95% of the\ninformation\", as some have claimed.  The quality scale is purely arbitrary;\nit's not a percentage of anything.\n\nThe name of the game in using JPEG is to pick the lowest quality setting\n(smallest file size) that decompresses into an image indistinguishable from\nthe original.  This setting will vary from one image to another and from one\nobserver to another, but here are some rules of thumb.\n\nThe default quality setting (-Q 75) is very often the best choice.  This\nsetting is about the lowest you can go without expecting to see defects in a\ntypical image.  Try -Q 75 first; if you see defects, then go up.  Except for\nexperimental purposes, never go above -Q 95; saying -Q 100 will produce a\nfile two or three times as large as -Q 95, but of hardly any better quality.\n\nIf the image was less than perfect quality to begin with, you might be able to\ngo down to -Q 50 without objectionable degradation.  On the other hand, you\nmight need to go to a HIGHER quality setting to avoid further degradation.\nThe second case seems to apply much of the time when converting GIFs to JPEG.\nThe default -Q 75 is about right for compressing 24-bit images, but -Q 85 to\n95 is usually better for converting GIFs (see section 14 for more info).\n\nIf you want a very small file (say for preview or indexing purposes) and are\nprepared to tolerate large defects, a -Q setting in the range of 5 to 10 is\nabout right.  -Q 2 or so may be amusing as \"op art\".\n\n(Note: the quality settings discussed in this article apply to the free JPEG\nsoftware described in section 6B, and to many programs based on it.  Other\nJPEG implementations, such as Image Alchemy, may use a completely different\nquality scale.  Some programs don't even provide a numeric scale, just\n\"high\"/\"medium\"/\"low\"-style choices.)\n\n\n[6]  Where can I get JPEG software?\n\nMost of the programs described in this section are available by FTP.\nIf you don't know how to use FTP, see the FAQ article \"How to find sources\".\n(If you don't have direct access to FTP, read about ftpmail servers in the\nsame article.)  That article appears regularly in news.answers, or you can\nget it by sending e-mail to mail-server@rtfm.mit.edu with\n\"send usenet/news.answers/finding-sources\" in the body.  The \"Anonymous FTP\nList FAQ\" may also be helpful --- it's usenet/news.answers/ftp-list/faq in\nthe news.answers archive.\n\nNOTE: this list changes constantly.  If you have a copy more than a couple\nmonths old, get the latest JPEG FAQ from the news.answers archive.\n\n\n[6A]  If you are looking for \"canned\" software, viewers, etc:\n\nThe first part of this list is system-specific programs that only run on one\nkind of system.  If you don't see what you want for your machine, check out\nthe portable JPEG software described at the end of the list.  Note that this\nlist concentrates on free and shareware programs that you can obtain over\nInternet; but some commercial programs are listed too.\n\nX Windows:\n\nJohn Bradley's free XV (version 2.00 and up) is an excellent viewer for JPEG,\nGIF, and other image formats.  It's available for FTP from export.lcs.mit.edu\nor ftp.cis.upenn.edu.  The file is called 'xv-???.tar.Z' (where ??? is the\nversion number, currently 2.21); it is located in the 'contrib' directory on\nexport or the 'pub/xv' directory at upenn.  XV reduces all images to 8 bits\ninternally, which means it's not a real good choice if you have a 24-bit\ndisplay (you'll still get only 8-bit color).  Also, you shouldn't use XV to\nconvert full-color images to JPEG, because they'll get color-quantized first.\nBut XV is a fine tool for converting GIF and other 8-bit images to JPEG.\nCAUTION: there is a glitch in versions 2.21 and earlier: be sure to check\nthe \"save at normal size\" checkbox when saving a JPEG file, or the file will\nbe blurry.\n\nAnother good choice for X Windows is John Cristy's free ImageMagick package,\nalso available from export.lcs.mit.edu, file contrib/ImageMagick.tar.Z.\nThis package handles many image processing and conversion tasks.  The\nImageMagick viewer handles 24-bit displays correctly; for colormapped\ndisplays, it does better (though slower) color quantization than XV or the\nbasic free JPEG software.\n\nBoth of the above are large, complex packages.  If you just want a simple\nimage viewer, try xloadimage or xli.  xloadimage supports JPEG in its latest\nrelease, 3.03.  xloadimage is free and available from export.lcs.mit.edu,\nfile contrib/xloadimage.3.03.tar.Z.  xli is a variant version of xloadimage,\nsaid by its fans to be somewhat faster and more robust than the original.\n(The current xli is indeed faster and more robust than the current\nxloadimage, at least with respect to JPEG files, because it has the IJG v4\ndecoder while xloadimage 3.03 is using a hacked-over v1.  The next\nxloadimage release will fix this.)  xli is also free and available from\nexport.lcs.mit.edu, file contrib/xli.1.14.tar.Z.  Both programs are said\nto do the right thing with 24-bit displays.\n\n\nMS-DOS:\n\nThis covers plain DOS; for Windows or OS/2 programs, see the next headings.\n\nOne good choice is Eric Praetzel's free DVPEG, which views JPEG and GIF files.\nThe current version, 2.4a, is available by FTP from sunee.uwaterloo.ca\n(129.97.50.50), file pub/jpeg/viewers/dvpeg24a.zip.  This is a good basic\nviewer that works on either 286 or 386/486 machines.  The user interface is\nnot flashy, but it's functional.\n\nAnother freeware JPEG/GIF/TGA viewer is Mohammad Rezaei's Hiview.  The\ncurrent version, 1.2, is available from Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE\nbelow), file msdos/graphics/hv12.zip.  Hiview requires a 386 or better CPU\nand a VCPI-compatible memory manager (QEMM386 and 386MAX work; Windows and\nOS/2 do not).  Hiview is currently the fastest viewer for images that are no\nbigger than your screen.  For larger images, it scales the image down to fit\non the screen (rather than using panning/scrolling as most viewers do).\nYou may or may not prefer this approach, but there's no denying that it\nslows down loading of large images considerably.  Note: installation is a\nbit tricky; read the directions carefully!\n\nA shareware alternative is ColorView for DOS ($30).  This is easier to\ninstall than either of the two freeware alternatives.  Its user interface is\nalso much spiffier-looking, although personally I find it harder to use ---\nmore keystrokes, inconsistent behavior.  It is faster than DVPEG but a\nlittle slower than Hiview, at least on my hardware.  (For images larger than\nscreen size, DVPEG and ColorView seem to be about the same speed, and both\nare faster than Hiview.)  The current version is 2.1, available from\nSimtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/dcview21.zip.\nRequires a VESA graphics driver; if you don't have one, look in vesadrv2.zip\nor vesa-tsr.zip from the same directory.  (Many recent PCs have a built-in\nVESA driver, so don't try to load a VESA driver unless ColorView complains\nthat the driver is missing.)\n\nA second shareware alternative is Fullview, which has been kicking around\nthe net for a while, but I don't know any stable archive location for it.\nThe current (rather old) version is inferior to the above viewers anyway.\nThe author tells me that a new version of Fullview will be out shortly\nand it will be submitted to the Simtel20 archives at that time.\n\nThe well-known GIF viewer CompuShow (CSHOW) supports JPEG in its latest\nrevision, 8.60a.  However, CSHOW's JPEG implementation isn't very good:\nit's slow (about half the speed of the above viewers) and image quality is\npoor except on hi-color displays.  Too bad ... it'd have been nice to see a\ngood JPEG capability in CSHOW.  Shareware, $25.  Available from Simtel20 and\nmirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/gif/cshw860a.zip.\n\nDue to the remarkable variety of PC graphics hardware, any one of these\nviewers might not work on your particular machine.  If you can't get *any*\nof them to work, you'll need to use one of the following conversion programs\nto convert JPEG to GIF, then view with your favorite GIF viewer.  (If you\nhave hi-color hardware, don't use GIF as the intermediate format; try to\nfind a TARGA-capable viewer instead.  VPIC5.0 is reputed to do the right\nthing with hi-color displays.)\n\nThe Independent JPEG Group's free JPEG converters are FTPable from Simtel20\nand mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/jpeg4.zip (or\njpeg4386.zip if you have a 386 and extended memory).  These files are DOS\ncompilations of the free source code described in section 6B; they will\nconvert JPEG to and from GIF, Targa, and PPM formats.\n\nHandmade Software offers free JPEG<=>GIF conversion tools, GIF2JPG/JPG2GIF.\nThese are slow and are limited to conversion to and from GIF format; in\nparticular, you can't get 24-bit color output from a JPEG.  The major\nadvantage of these tools is that they will read and write HSI's proprietary\nJPEG format as well as the Usenet-standard JFIF format.  Since HSI-format\nfiles are rather widespread on BBSes, this is a useful capability.  Version\n2.0 of these tools is free (prior versions were shareware).  Get it from\nSimtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/gif2jpg2.zip.\nNOTE: do not use HSI format for files to be posted on Internet, since it is\nnot readable on non-PC platforms.\n\nHandmade Software also has a shareware image conversion and manipulation\npackage, Image Alchemy.  This will translate JPEG files (both JFIF and HSI\nformats) to and from many other image formats.  It can also display images.\nA demo version of Image Alchemy version 1.6.1 is available from Simtel20 and\nmirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/alch161.zip.\n\nNOTE ABOUT SIMTEL20: The Internet's key archive site for PC-related programs\nis Simtel20, full name wsmr-simtel20.army.mil (192.88.110.20).  Simtel20\nruns a non-Unix system with weird directory names; where this document\nrefers to directory (eg) \"msdos/graphics\" at Simtel20, that really means\n\"pd1:<msdos.graphics>\".  If you are not physically on MILnet, you should\nexpect rather slow FTP transfer rates from Simtel20.  There are several\nInternet sites that maintain copies (mirrors) of the Simtel20 archives;\nmost FTP users should go to one of the mirror sites instead.  A popular USA\nmirror site is oak.oakland.edu (141.210.10.117), which keeps Simtel20 files\nin (eg) \"/pub/msdos/graphics\".  If you have no FTP capability, you can\nretrieve files from Simtel20 by e-mail; see informational postings in\ncomp.archives.msdos.announce to find out how.  If you are outside the USA,\nconsult the same newsgroup to learn where your nearest Simtel20 mirror is.\n\nMicrosoft Windows:\n\nThere are several Windows programs capable of displaying JPEG images.\n(Windows viewers are generally slower than DOS viewers on the same hardware,\ndue to Windows' system overhead.  Note that you can run the DOS conversion\nprograms described above inside a Windows DOS window.)\n\nThe newest entry is WinECJ, which is free and EXTREMELY fast.  Version 1.0\nis available from ftp.rahul.net, file /pub/bryanw/pc/jpeg/wecj.zip.\nRequires Windows 3.1 and 256-or-more-colors mode.  This is a no-frills\nviewer with the bad habit of hogging the machine completely while it\ndecodes; and the image quality is noticeably worse than other viewers.\nBut it's so fast you'll use it anyway, at least for previewing...\n\nJView is freeware, fairly fast, has good on-line help, and can write out the\ndecompressed image in Windows BMP format; but it can't create new JPEG\nfiles, and it doesn't view GIFs.  JView also lacks some other useful\nfeatures of the shareware viewers (such as brightness adjustment), but it's\nan excellent basic viewer.  The current version, 0.9, is available from\nftp.cica.indiana.edu (129.79.20.84), file pub/pc/win3/desktop/jview090.zip.\n(Mirrors of this archive can be found at some other Internet sites,\nincluding wuarchive.wustl.edu.)\n\nWinJPEG (shareware, $20) displays JPEG,GIF,Targa,TIFF, and BMP image files;\nit can write all of these formats too, so it can be used as a converter.\nIt has some other nifty features including color-balance adjustment and\nslideshow.  The current version is 2.1, available from Simtel20 and mirror\nsites (see NOTE above), file msdos/windows3/winjp210.zip.  (This is a slow\n286-compatible version; if you register, you'll get the 386-only version,\nwhich is roughly 25% faster.)\n\nColorView is another shareware entry ($30).  This was an early and promising\ncontender, but it has not been updated in some time, and at this point it\nhas no real advantages over WinJPEG.  If you want to try it anyway, the\ncurrent version is 0.97, available from ftp.cica.indiana.edu, file\npub/pc/win3/desktop/cview097.zip.  (I understand that a new version will\nbe appearing once the authors are finished with ColorView for DOS.)\n\nDVPEG (see DOS heading) also works under Windows, but only in full-screen\nmode, not in a window.\n\nOS/2:\n\nThe following files are available from hobbes.nmsu.edu (128.123.35.151).\nNote: check /pub/uploads for more recent versions --- the hobbes moderator\nis not very fast about moving uploads into their permanent directories.\n/pub/os2/2.x/graphics/jpegv4.zip\n    32-bit version of free IJG conversion programs, version 4.\n/pub/os2/all/graphics/jpeg4-16.zip\n    16-bit version of same, for OS/2 1.x.\n/pub/os2/2.x/graphics/imgarc11.zip\n    Image Archiver 1.01: image conversion/viewing with PM graphical interface.\n    Strong on conversion functions, viewing is a bit weaker.  Shareware, $15.\n/pub/os2/2.x/graphics/pmjpeg11.zip\n    PMJPEG 1.1: OS/2 2.x port of WinJPEG, a popular viewer for Windows\n    (see description in Windows section).  Shareware, $20.\n/pub/os2/2.x/graphics/pmview84.zip\n    PMView 0.84: JPEG/GIF/BMP viewer.  GIF viewing very fast, JPEG viewing\n    fast if you have huge amounts of RAM, otherwise about the same speed\n    as the above programs.  Strong 24-bit display support.  Shareware, $20.\n\nMacintosh:\n\nMost Mac JPEG programs rely on Apple's JPEG implementation, which is part of\nthe QuickTime system extension; so you need to have QuickTime installed.\nTo use QuickTime, you need a 68020 or better CPU and you need to be running\nSystem 6.0.7 or later.  (If you're running System 6, you must also install\nthe 32-bit QuickDraw extension; this is built-in on System 7.)  You can get\nQuickTime by FTP from ftp.apple.com, file dts/mac/quicktime/quicktime.hqx.\n(As of 11/92, this file contains QuickTime 1.5, which is better than QT 1.0\nin several ways.  With respect to JPEG, it is marginally faster and\nconsiderably less prone to crash when fed a corrupt JPEG file.  However,\nsome applications seem to have compatibility problems with QT 1.5.)\n\nMac users should keep in mind that QuickTime's JPEG format, PICT/JPEG, is\nnot the same as the Usenet-standard JFIF JPEG format.  (See section 10 for\ndetails.)  If you post images on Usenet, make sure they are in JFIF format.\nMost of the programs mentioned below can generate either format.\n\nThe first choice is probably JPEGView, a free program for viewing images\nthat are in JFIF format, PICT/JPEG format, or GIF format.  It also can\nconvert between the two JPEG formats.  The current version, 2.0, is a big\nimprovement over prior versions.  Get it from sumex-aim.stanford.edu\n(36.44.0.6), file /info-mac/app/jpeg-view-20.hqx.  Requires System 7 and\nQuickTime.  On 8-bit displays, JPEGView usually produces the best color\nimage quality of all the currently available Mac JPEG viewers.  JPEGView can\nview large images in much less memory than other Mac viewers; in fact, it's\nthe only one that can deal with JPEG images much over 640x480 pixels on a\ntypical 4MB Mac.  Given a large image, JPEGView automatically scales it down\nto fit on the screen, rather than presenting scroll bars like most other\nviewers.  (You can zoom in on any desired portion, though.)  Some people\nlike this behavior, some don't.  Overall, JPEGView's user interface is very\nwell thought out.\n\nGIFConverter, a shareware ($40) image viewer/converter, supports JFIF and\nPICT/JPEG, as well as GIF and several other image formats.  The latest\nversion is 2.3.2.  Get it from sumex-aim.stanford.edu, file\n/info-mac/art/gif/gif-converter-232.hqx.  Requires System 6.0.5 or later.\nGIFConverter is not better than JPEGView as a plain JPEG/GIF viewer, but\nit has much more extensive image manipulation and format conversion\ncapabilities, so you may find it worth its shareware fee if you do a lot of\nplaying around with images.  Also, the newest version of GIFConverter can\nload and save JFIF images *without* QuickTime, so it is your best bet if\nyour machine is too old to run QuickTime.  (But it's faster with QuickTime.)\nNote: If GIFConverter runs out of memory trying to load a large JPEG, try\nconverting the file to GIF with JPEG Convert, then viewing the GIF version.\n\nJPEG Convert, a Mac version of the free IJG JPEG conversion utilities, is\navailable from sumex-aim.stanford.edu, file /info-mac/app/jpeg-convert-10.hqx.\nThis will run on any Mac, but it only does file conversion, not viewing.\nYou can use it in conjunction with any GIF viewer.\n\nPrevious versions of this FAQ recommended Imagery JPEG v0.6, a JPEG<=>GIF\nconverter based on an old version of the IJG code.  If you are using this\nprogram, you definitely should replace it with JPEG Convert.\n\nApple's free program PictPixie can view images in JFIF, QuickTime JPEG, and\nGIF format, and can convert between these formats.  You can get PictPixie\nfrom ftp.apple.com, file dts/mac/quicktime/qt.1.0.stuff/pictpixie.hqx.\nRequires QuickTime.  PictPixie was intended as a developer's tool, and it's\nreally not the best choice unless you like to fool around with QuickTime.\nSome of its drawbacks are that it requires lots of memory, it produces\nrelatively poor color image quality on anything less than a 24-bit display,\nand it has a relatively unfriendly user interface.  Worse, PictPixie is an\nunsupported program, meaning it has some minor bugs that Apple does not\nintend to fix.  (There is an old version of PictPixie, called\nPICTCompressor, floating around the net.  If you have this you should trash\nit, as it's even buggier.  Also, the QuickTime Starter Kit includes a much\ncleaned-up descendant of PictPixie called Picture Compressor.  Note that\nPicture Compressor is NOT free and may not be distributed on the net.)\n\nStorm Technology's Picture Decompress is a free JPEG viewer/converter.\nThis rather old program is inferior to the above programs in many ways, but\nit will run without System 7 or QuickTime, so you may be forced to use it on\nolder systems.  (It does need 32-bit QuickDraw, so really old machines can't\nuse it.)  You can get it from sumex-aim.stanford.edu, file\n/info-mac/app/picture-decompress-201.hqx.  You must set the file type of a\ndownloaded image file to 'JPEG' to allow Picture Decompress to open it.\n\nIf your machine is too old to run 32-bit QuickDraw (a Mac Plus for instance),\nGIFConverter is your only choice for single-program JPEG viewing.  If you\ndon't want to pay for GIFConverter, use JPEG Convert and a free GIF viewer.\n\nMore and more commercial Mac applications are supporting JPEG, although not\nall can deal with the Usenet-standard JFIF format.  Adobe Photoshop, version\n2.0.1 or later, can read and write JFIF-format JPEG files (use the JPEG\nplug-in from the Acquire menu).  You must set the file type of a downloaded\nJPEG file to 'JPEG' to allow Photoshop to recognize it.\n\nAmiga:\n\n(Most programs listed in this section are stored in the AmiNet archive at\namiga.physik.unizh.ch (130.60.80.80).  There are many mirror sites of this\narchive and you should try to use the closest one.  In the USA, a good\nchoice is wuarchive.wustl.edu; look under /mirrors/amiga.physik.unizh.ch/...)\n\nHamLab Plus is an excellent JPEG viewer/converter, as well as being a\ngeneral image manipulation tool.  It's cheap (shareware, $20) and can read\nseveral formats besides JPEG.  The current version is 2.0.8.  A demo version\nis available from amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror sites), file\namiga/gfx/edit/hamlab208d.lha.  The demo version will crop images larger\nthan 512x512, but it is otherwise fully functional.\n\nRend24 (shareware, $30) is an image renderer that can display JPEG, ILBM,\nand GIF images.  The program can be used to create animations, even\ncapturing frames on-the-fly from rendering packages like Lightwave.  The\ncurrent version is 1.05, available from amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror\nsites), file amiga/os30/gfx/rend105.lha.  (Note: although this directory is\nsupposedly for AmigaDOS 3.0 programs, the program will also run under\nAmigaDOS 1.3, 2.04 or 2.1.)\n\nViewtek is a free JPEG/ILBM/GIF/ANIM viewer.  The current version is 1.04,\navailable from amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror sites), file\namiga/gfx/show/ViewTek104.lha.\n\nIf you're willing to spend real money, there are several commercial packages\nthat support JPEG.  Two are written by Thomas Krehbiel, the author of Rend24\nand Viewtek.  These are CineMorph, a standalone image morphing package, and\nImageFX, an impressive 24-bit image capture, conversion, editing, painting,\neffects and prepress package that also includes CineMorph.  Both are\ndistributed by Great Valley Products.  Art Department Professional (ADPro),\nfrom ASDG Inc, is the most widely used commercial image manipulation\nsoftware for Amigas.  ImageMaster, from Black Belt Systems, is another\nwell-regarded commercial graphics package with JPEG support.\n\nThe free IJG JPEG software is available compiled for Amigas from\namiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror sites) in directory amiga/gfx/conv, file\nAmigaJPEGV4.lha.  These programs convert JPEG to/from PPM,GIF,Targa formats.\n\nThe Amiga world is heavily infested with quick-and-dirty JPEG programs, many\nbased on an ancient beta-test version of the free IJG JPEG software (thanks\nto a certain magazine that published same on its disk-of-the-month, without\nso much as notifying the authors).  Among these are \"AugJPEG\", \"NewAmyJPEG\",\n\"VJPEG\", and probably others I have not even heard of.  In my opinion,\nanything older than IJG version 3 (March 1992) is not worth the disk space\nit's stored on; if you have such a program, trash it and get something newer.\n\nAtari ST:\n\nThe free IJG JPEG software is available compiled for Atari ST, TT, etc,\nfrom atari.archive.umich.edu, file /atari/Graphics/jpeg4bin.zoo.\nThese programs convert JPEG to/from PPM, GIF, Targa formats.\n\nI have not heard of any free or shareware JPEG-capable viewer for Ataris,\nbut surely there must be one by now?  Pointers appreciated.\n\nAcorn Archimedes:\n\n!ChangeFSI, supplied with RISC OS 3 version 3.10, can convert from and view\nJPEG JFIF format.  Provision is also made to convert images to JPEG,\nalthough this must be done from the CLI rather than by double-clicking.\n\nRecent versions (since 7.11) of the shareware program Translator can handle\nJPEG, along with about 30 other image formats.  While older versions can be\nfound on some Archimedes bboards, the current version is only available by\nregistering with the author, John Kortink, Nutterbrink 31, 7544 WJ, Enschede,\nThe Netherlands.  Price 35 Dutch guilders (about $22 or 10 pounds).\n\nThere's also a commercial product called !JPEG which provides JPEG read/write\nfunctionality and direct JPEG viewing, as well as a host of other image\nformat conversion and processing options.  This is more expensive but not\nnecessarily better than the above programs.  Contact: DT Software, FREEPOST,\nCambridge, UK.  Tel: 0223 841099.\n\n\nPortable software for almost any system:\n\nIf none of the above fits your situation, you can obtain and compile the free\nJPEG conversion software described in 6B.  You'll also need a viewer program.\nIf your display is 8 bits or less, any GIF viewer will do fine; if you have a\ndisplay with more color capability, try to find a viewer that can read Targa\nor PPM 24-bit image files.\n\nThere are numerous commercial JPEG offerings, with more popping up every\nday.  I recommend that you not spend money on one of these unless you find\nthe available free or shareware software vastly too slow.  In that case,\npurchase a hardware-assisted product.  Ask pointed questions about whether\nthe product complies with the final JPEG standard and about whether it can\nhandle the JFIF file format; many of the earliest commercial releases are\nnot and never will be compatible with anyone else's files.\n\n\n[6B]  If you are looking for source code to work with:\n\nFree, portable C code for JPEG compression is available from the Independent\nJPEG Group, which I lead.  A package containing our source code,\ndocumentation, and some small test files is available from several places.\nThe \"official\" archive site for this source code is ftp.uu.net (137.39.1.9\nor 192.48.96.9).  Look under directory /graphics/jpeg; the current release\nis jpegsrc.v4.tar.Z.  (This is a compressed TAR file; don't forget to\nretrieve in binary mode.)  You can retrieve this file by FTP or UUCP.\nIf you are on a PC and don't know how to cope with .tar.Z format, you may\nprefer ZIP format, which you can find at Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE\nabove), file msdos/graphics/jpegsrc4.zip.  This file will also be available on\nCompuServe, in the GRAPHSUPPORT forum (GO PICS), library 15, as jpsrc4.zip.\nIf you have no FTP access, you can retrieve the source from your nearest\ncomp.sources.misc archive; version 4 appeared as issues 55-72 of volume 34.\n(If you don't know how to retrieve comp.sources.misc postings, see the FAQ\narticle \"How to find sources\", referred to at the top of section 6.)\n\nThe free JPEG code provides conversion between JPEG \"JFIF\" format and image\nfiles in GIF, PBMPLUS PPM/PGM, Utah RLE, and Truevision Targa file formats.\nThe core compression and decompression modules can easily be reused in other\nprograms, such as image viewers.  The package is highly portable; we have\ntested it on many machines ranging from PCs to Crays.\n\nWe have released this software for both noncommercial and commercial use.\nCompanies are welcome to use it as the basis for JPEG-related products.\nWe do not ask a royalty, although we do ask for an acknowledgement in\nproduct literature (see the README file in the distribution for details).\nWe hope to make this software industrial-quality --- although, as with\nanything that's free, we offer no warranty and accept no liability.\n\nThe Independent JPEG Group is a volunteer organization; if you'd like to\ncontribute to improving our software, you are welcome to join.\n\n\n[7]  What's all this hoopla about color quantization?\n\nMost people don't have full-color (24 bit per pixel) display hardware.\nTypical display hardware stores 8 or fewer bits per pixel, so it can display\n256 or fewer distinct colors at a time.  To display a full-color image, the\ncomputer must map the image into an appropriate set of representative\ncolors.  This process is called \"color quantization\".  (This is something\nof a misnomer, \"color selection\" would be a better term.  We're stuck with\nthe standard usage though.)\n\nClearly, color quantization is a lossy process.  It turns out that for most\nimages, the details of the color quantization algorithm have MUCH more impact\non the final image quality than do any errors introduced by JPEG (except at\nthe very lowest JPEG quality settings).\n\nSince JPEG is a full-color format, converting a color JPEG image for display\non 8-bit-or-less hardware requires color quantization.  This is true for\n*all* color JPEGs: even if you feed a 256-or-less-color GIF into JPEG, what\ncomes out of the decompressor is *not* 256 colors, but thousands of colors.\nThis happens because JPEG's lossiness affects each pixel a little\ndifferently, so two pixels that started with identical colors will probably\ncome out with slightly different colors.  Each original color gets \"smeared\"\ninto a group of nearby colors.  Therefore quantization is always required to\ndisplay a color JPEG on a colormapped display, regardless of the image\nsource.  The only way to avoid quantization is to ask for gray-scale output.\n\n(Incidentally, because of this effect it's nearly meaningless to talk about\nthe number of colors used by a JPEG image.  Even if you attempted to count\nthe number of distinct pixel values, different JPEG decoders would give you\ndifferent results because of roundoff error differences.  I occasionally see\nposted images described as \"256-color JPEG\".  This tells me that the poster\n(a) hasn't read this FAQ and (b) probably converted the JPEG from a GIF.\nJPEGs can be classified as color or gray-scale (just like photographs), but\nnumber of colors just isn't a useful concept for JPEG.)\n\nOn the other hand, a GIF image by definition has already been quantized to\n256 or fewer colors.  (A GIF *does* have a definite number of colors in its\npalette, and the format doesn't allow more than 256 palette entries.)\nFor purposes of Usenet picture distribution, GIF has the advantage that the\nsender precomputes the color quantization, so recipients don't have to.\nThis is also the *disadvantage* of GIF: you're stuck with the sender's\nquantization.  If the sender quantized to a different number of colors than\nwhat you can display, you have to re-quantize, resulting in much poorer\nimage quality than if you had quantized once from a full-color image.\nFurthermore, if the sender didn't use a high-quality color quantization\nalgorithm, you're out of luck.\n\nFor this reason, JPEG offers the promise of significantly better image quality\nfor all users whose machines don't match the sender's display hardware.\nJPEG's full color image can be quantized to precisely match the user's display\nhardware.  Furthermore, you will be able to take advantage of future\nimprovements in quantization algorithms (there is a lot of active research in\nthis area), or purchase better display hardware, to get a better view of JPEG\nimages you already have.  With a GIF, you're stuck forevermore with what was\nsent.\n\nIt's also worth mentioning that many GIF-viewing programs include rather\nshoddy quantization routines.  If you view a 256-color GIF on a 16-color EGA\ndisplay, for example, you are probably getting a much worse image than you\nneed to.  This is partly an inevitable consequence of doing two color\nquantizations (one to create the GIF, one to display it), but often it's\nalso due to sloppiness.  JPEG conversion programs will be forced to use\nhigh quality quantizers in order to get acceptable results at all, and in\nnormal use they will quantize directly to the number of colors to be\ndisplayed.  Thus, JPEG is likely to provide better results than the average\nGIF program for low-color-resolution displays as well as high-resolution ones!\n\nFinally, an ever-growing number of people have better-than-8-bit display\nhardware already: 15-bit \"hi-color\" PC displays, true 24-bit displays on\nworkstations and Macintoshes, etc.  For these people, GIF is already\nobsolete, as it cannot represent an image to the full capabilities of their\ndisplay.  JPEG images can drive these displays much more effectively.\nThus, JPEG is an all-around better choice than GIF for representing images\nin a machine-independent fashion.\n\n\n[8]  How does JPEG work?\n\nThe buzz-words to know are chrominance subsampling, discrete cosine\ntransforms, coefficient quantization, and Huffman or arithmetic entropy\ncoding.  This article's long enough already, so I'm not going to say more\nthan that here.  For technical information, see the comp.compression FAQ.\nThis is available from the news.answers archive at rtfm.mit.edu, in files\n/pub/usenet/news.answers/compression-faq/part[1-3].  If you need help in\nusing the news.answers archive, see the top of this article.\n\n\n[9]  What about lossless JPEG?\n\nThere's a great deal of confusion on this subject.  The JPEG committee did\ndefine a truly lossless compression algorithm, i.e., one that guarantees the\nfinal output is bit-for-bit identical to the original input.  However, this\nlossless mode has almost nothing in common with the regular, lossy JPEG\nalgorithm, and it offers much less compression.  At present, very few\nimplementations of lossless JPEG exist, and all of them are commercial.\n\nSaying \"-Q 100\" to the free JPEG software DOES NOT get you a lossless image.\nWhat it does get rid of is deliberate information loss in the coefficient\nquantization step.  There is still a good deal of information loss in the\ncolor subsampling step.  (With the V4 free JPEG code, you can also say\n\"-sample 1x1\" to turn off subsampling.  Keep in mind that many commercial\nJPEG implementations cannot cope with the resulting file.)\n\nEven with both quantization and subsampling turned off, the regular JPEG\nalgorithm is not lossless, because it is subject to roundoff errors in\nvarious calculations.  The maximum error is a few counts in any one pixel\nvalue; it's highly unlikely that this could be perceived by the human eye,\nbut it might be a concern if you are doing machine processing of an image.\n\nAt this minimum-loss setting, regular JPEG produces files that are perhaps\nhalf the size of an uncompressed 24-bit-per-pixel image.  True lossless JPEG\nprovides roughly the same amount of compression, but it guarantees\nbit-for-bit accuracy.\n\nIf you have an application requiring lossless storage of images with less\nthan 6 bits per pixel (per color component), you may want to look into the\nJBIG bilevel image compression standard.  This performs better than JPEG\nlossless on such images.  JPEG lossless is superior to JBIG on images with\n6 or more bits per pixel; furthermore, JPEG is public domain (at least with a\nHuffman back end), while the JBIG techniques are heavily covered by patents.\n\n\n[10]  Why all the argument about file formats?\n\nStrictly speaking, JPEG refers only to a family of compression algorithms;\nit does *not* refer to a specific image file format.  The JPEG committee was\nprevented from defining a file format by turf wars within the international\nstandards organizations.\n\nSince we can't actually exchange images with anyone else unless we agree on\na common file format, this leaves us with a problem.  In the absence of\nofficial standards, a number of JPEG program writers have just gone off to\n\"do their own thing\", and as a result their programs aren't compatible with\nanybody else's.\n\nThe closest thing we have to a de-facto standard JPEG format is some work\nthat's been coordinated by people at C-Cube Microsystems.  They have defined\ntwo JPEG-based file formats:\n  * JFIF (JPEG File Interchange Format), a \"low-end\" format that transports\n    pixels and not much else.\n  * TIFF/JPEG, aka TIFF 6.0, an extension of the Aldus TIFF format.  TIFF is\n    a \"high-end\" format that will let you record just about everything you\n    ever wanted to know about an image, and a lot more besides :-).  TIFF is\n    a lot more complex than JFIF, and may well prove less transportable,\n    because different vendors have historically implemented slightly different\n    and incompatible subsets of TIFF.  It's not likely that adding JPEG to the\n    mix will do anything to improve this situation.\nBoth of these formats were developed with input from all the major vendors\nof JPEG-related products; it's reasonably likely that future commercial\nproducts will adhere to one or both standards.\n\nI believe that Usenet should adopt JFIF as the replacement for GIF in\npicture postings.  JFIF is simpler than TIFF and is available now; the\nTIFF 6.0 spec has only recently been officially adopted, and it is still\nunusably vague on some crucial details.  Even when TIFF/JPEG is well\ndefined, the JFIF format is likely to be a widely supported \"lowest common\ndenominator\"; TIFF/JPEG files may never be as transportable.\n\nA particular case that people may be interested in is Apple's QuickTime\nsoftware for the Macintosh.  QuickTime uses a JFIF-compatible format wrapped\ninside the Mac-specific PICT structure.  Conversion between JFIF and\nQuickTime JPEG is pretty straightforward, and several Mac programs are\navailable to do it (see Mac portion of section 6A).  If you have an editor\nthat handles binary files, you can strip a QuickTime JPEG PICT down to JFIF\nby hand; see section 11 for details.\n\nAnother particular case is Handmade Software's programs (GIF2JPG/JPG2GIF and\nImage Alchemy).  These programs are capable of reading and writing JFIF\nformat.  By default, though, they write a proprietary format developed by\nHSI.  This format is NOT readable by any non-HSI programs and should not be\nused for Usenet postings.  Use the -j switch to get JFIF output.  (This\napplies to old versions of these programs; the current releases emit JFIF\nformat by default.  You still should be careful not to post HSI-format\nfiles, unless you want to get flamed by people on non-PC platforms.)\n\n\n[11]  How do I recognize which file format I have, and what do I do about it?\n\nIf you have an alleged JPEG file that your software won't read, it's likely\nto be HSI format or some other proprietary JPEG-based format.  You can tell\nwhat you have by inspecting the first few bytes of the file:\n\n1.  A JFIF-standard file will start with the characters (hex) FF D8 FF E0,\n    followed by two variable bytes (often hex 00 10), followed by 'JFIF'.\n\n2.  If you see FF D8 at the start, but not the rest of it, you may have a\n    \"raw JPEG\" file.  This is probably decodable as-is by JFIF software ---\n    it's worth a try, anyway.\n\n3.  HSI files start with 'hsi1'.  You're out of luck unless you have HSI\n    software.  Portions of the file may look like plain JPEG data, but they\n    won't decompress properly with non-HSI programs.\n\n4.  A Macintosh PICT file, if JPEG-compressed, will have a couple hundred\n    bytes of header followed by a JFIF header (scan for 'JFIF').  Strip off\n    everything before the FF D8 and you should be able to read it.\n\n5.  Anything else: it's a proprietary format, or not JPEG at all.  If you are\n    lucky, the file may consist of a header and a raw JPEG data stream.\n    If you can identify the start of the JPEG data stream (look for FF D8),\n    try stripping off everything before that.\n\nIn uuencoded Usenet postings, the characteristic JFIF pattern is\n\n\t\"begin\" line\n\tM_]C_X ...\n\nwhereas uuencoded HSI files will start with\n\n\t\"begin\" line\n\tM:'-I ...\n\nIf you learn to check for the former, you can save yourself the trouble of\ndownloading non-JFIF files.\n\n\n[12]  What about arithmetic coding?\n\nThe JPEG spec defines two different \"back end\" modules for the final output\nof compressed data: either Huffman coding or arithmetic coding is allowed.\nThe choice has no impact on image quality, but arithmetic coding usually\nproduces a smaller compressed file.  On typical images, arithmetic coding\nproduces a file 5 or 10 percent smaller than Huffman coding.  (All the\nfile-size numbers previously cited are for Huffman coding.)\n\nUnfortunately, the particular variant of arithmetic coding specified by the\nJPEG standard is subject to patents owned by IBM, AT&T, and Mitsubishi.\nThus *you cannot legally use arithmetic coding* unless you obtain licenses\nfrom these companies.  (The \"fair use\" doctrine allows people to implement\nand test the algorithm, but actually storing any images with it is dubious\nat best.)\n\nAt least in the short run, I recommend that people not worry about\narithmetic coding; the space savings isn't great enough to justify the\npotential legal hassles.  In particular, arithmetic coding *should not*\nbe used for any images to be exchanged on Usenet.\n\nThere is some small chance that the legal situation may change in the\nfuture.  Stay tuned for further details.\n\n\n[13]  Does loss accumulate with repeated compression/decompression?\n\nIt would be nice if, having compressed an image with JPEG, you could\ndecompress it, manipulate it (crop off a border, say), and recompress it\nwithout any further image degradation beyond what you lost initially.\nUnfortunately THIS IS NOT THE CASE.  In general, recompressing an altered\nimage loses more information, though usually not as much as was lost the\nfirst time around.\n\nThe next best thing would be that if you decompress an image and recompress\nit *without changing it* then there is no further loss, i.e., you get an\nidentical JPEG file.  Even this is not true; at least, not with the current\nfree JPEG software.  It's essentially a problem of accumulation of roundoff\nerror.  If you repeatedly compress and decompress, the image will eventually\ndegrade to where you can see visible changes from the first-generation\noutput.  (It usually takes many such cycles to get visible change.)\nOne of the things on our to-do list is to see if accumulation of error can\nbe avoided or limited, but I am not optimistic about it.\n\nIn any case, the most that could possibly be guaranteed would be that\ncompressing the unmodified full-color output of djpeg, at the original\nquality setting, would introduce no further loss.  Even such simple changes\nas cropping off a border could cause further roundoff-error degradation.\n(If you're wondering why, it's because the pixel-block boundaries move.\nIf you cropped off only multiples of 16 pixels, you might be safe, but\nthat's a mighty limited capability!)\n\nThe bottom line is that JPEG is a useful format for archival storage and\ntransmission of images, but you don't want to use it as an intermediate\nformat for sequences of image manipulation steps.  Use a lossless format\n(PPM, RLE, TIFF, etc) while working on the image, then JPEG it when you are\nready to file it away.  Aside from avoiding degradation, you will save a lot\nof compression/decompression time this way :-).\n\n\n[14]  What are some rules of thumb for converting GIF images to JPEG?\n\nAs stated earlier, you *will* lose some amount of image information if you\nconvert an existing GIF image to JPEG.  If you can obtain the original\nfull-color data the GIF was made from, it's far better to make a JPEG from\nthat.  But if you need to save space and have only the GIF to work from,\nhere are some suggestions for getting maximum space savings with minimum\nloss of quality.\n\nThe first rule when converting a GIF library is to look at each JPEG, to\nmake sure you are happy with it, before throwing away the corresponding GIF;\nthat will give you a chance to re-do the conversion with a higher quality\nsetting if necessary.  Some GIFs may be better left as GIFs, as explained in\nsection 3; in particular, cartoon-type GIFs with sixteen or fewer colors\ndon't convert well.  You may find that a JPEG file of reasonable quality\nwill be *larger* than the GIF.  (So check the sizes too.)\n\nExperience to date suggests that large, high-visual-quality GIFs are the best\ncandidates for conversion to JPEG.  They chew up the most storage so offer\nthe most potential savings, and they convert to JPEG with least degradation.\nDon't waste your time converting any GIF much under 100 Kbytes.  Also, don't\nexpect JPEG files converted from GIFs to be as small as those created\ndirectly from full-color originals.  To maintain image quality you may have\nto let the converted files be as much as twice as big as straight-through\nJPEG files would be (i.e., shoot for 1/2 or 1/3rd the size of the GIF file,\nnot 1/4th as suggested in earlier comparisons).\n\nMany people have developed an odd habit of putting a large constant-color\nborder around a GIF image.  While useless, this was nearly free in terms of\nstorage cost in GIF files.  It is NOT free in JPEG files, and the sharp\nborder boundary can create visible artifacts (\"ghost\" edges).  Do yourself\na favor and crop off any border before JPEGing.  (If you are on an X Windows\nsystem, XV's manual and automatic cropping functions are a very painless\nway to do this.)\n\ncjpeg's default Q setting of 75 is appropriate for full-color input, but\nfor GIF inputs, Q settings of 85 to 95 often seem to be necessary to avoid\nimage degradation.  (If you apply smoothing as suggested below, the higher\nQ setting may not be necessary.)\n\nColor GIFs of photographs or complex artwork are usually \"dithered\" to fool\nyour eye into seeing more than the 256 colors that GIF can actually store.\nIf you enlarge the image, you will see that adjacent pixels are often of\nsignificantly different colors; at normal size the eye averages these pixels\ntogether to produce the illusion of an intermediate color value.  The\ntrouble with dithering is that, to JPEG, it looks like high-spatial-frequency\ncolor noise; and JPEG can't compress noise very well.  The resulting JPEG\nfile is both larger and of lower image quality than what you would have\ngotten from JPEGing the original full color image (if you had it).\nTo get around this, you want to \"smooth\" the GIF image before compression.\nSmoothing averages together nearby pixels, thus approximating the color that\nyou thought you saw anyway, and in the process getting rid of the rapid\ncolor changes that give JPEG trouble.  Appropriate use of smoothing will\noften let you avoid using a high Q factor, thus further reducing the size of\nthe compressed file, while still obtaining a better-looking output image\nthan you'd get without smoothing.\n\nWith the V4 free JPEG software (or products based on it), a simple smoothing\ncapability is built in.  Try \"-smooth 10\" or so when converting GIFs.\nValues of 10 to 25 seem to work well for high-quality GIFs.  Heavy-handed\ndithering may require larger smoothing factors.  (If you can see regular\nfine-scale patterns on the GIF image even without enlargement, then strong\nsmoothing is definitely called for.)  Too large a smoothing factor will blur\nthe output image, which you don't want.  If you are an image processing\nwizard, you can also do smoothing with a separate filtering program, such as\npnmconvol from the PBMPLUS package.  However, cjpeg's built-in smoother is\na LOT faster than pnmconvol...\n\nThe upshot of all this is that \"cjpeg -quality 85 -smooth 10\" is probably a\ngood starting point for converting GIFs.  But if you really care about the\nimage, you'll want to check the results and maybe try a few other settings.\n\n\n---------------------\n\nFor more information about JPEG in general or the free JPEG software in\nparticular, contact the Independent JPEG Group at jpeg-info@uunet.uu.net.\n","label":"comp.graphics"}

{"text":"Classify the following data: Is life a pass/fail course, and does God grade on a\ncurve?\n\tI'm new here, and only vaguely religious, but I want to\nknow what some of you people think.  Specifically, are there an\ninfinite number of Heavens, and a person goes to the one that\nhe/she deserves?  Or is it simply Heaven or nothing (Hell?)\nAlso, are we \"graded\" by those around us, or has there always\nbeen some unchanging method?  Is the person's childhood taken\ninto account?\n\tI'm sure these must sound like over-simplifications to\nmost of you, but I figure that you're the experts.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t-Quinn\n\n[Eschatology is an area on which Christians do not agree.  I suspect\nthat's because our primary source of information is prophets and\nvisionaries, and their writings tend to be highly symbolic.  However\nboth Jesus' teachings in the Gospels and books such as the Revelation\nto John talk primarily about the difference between eternal life and\neternal death.  On a number of occasions Jesus does say things that\nimply some sort of differentiation, e.g. Lk 10:14 and a number of\nsimilar passages where Jesus says things like \"even XXX will be better\noff than you in the judgement.\"  Also, I Cor 3 talks about someone who\ngets into heaven, but by the skin of his teeth, as it were.  But these\npassages are not normally interpreted as suggesting separate heavens,\nso much as differing levels of prestige or punishment in heaven or\nhell (and not all Christians would even go as far as that).  The only\nChristian group I know of that believes in multiple heavens is the\nMormons, and they are very far from mainstream Christianity (far\nenough that many of our readers would not call them Christian).  Their\nideas in this area involve specific Mormon revelations, in addition\nto the Bible and \"Holy Tradition\" of a more generic Christian sort.\n\nNote that many Christians will cringe at the very thought of\nassociating grading with God.  The whole point of Christ was to free\nus from the results of a test that we couldn't possibly pass.  If you\nlike test analogies, God grades on a very strict and unbending scale,\nbut he also cheats -- he replaces our test papers with an exam that\nwas prepared by the teacher, before actually doing the grading.\nBecause some people end up in heaven and others in hell, it's easy to\nsee why you'd be inclined to think of it as grading.  While there are\ndifferences among branches of Christianity on details, I think we all\nagree that in one way or another, God cheats.\n\nI am personally very sceptical about anyone who claims to know exactly\nhow far God's cheating extends.  Will he accept people who don't\nexplicitly acknowledge Christ, but somehow still follow him in their\nhearts?  Many Christians believe that this is possible, at least in\nprinciple, but certainly not all do.  Jesus provided us with a clear\ndescription of how to be saved, but it's not clear to me that he\nprovided an exact description of how he's going to place the dividing\nline.  Certainly he made it clear that we can't expect to know whether\nother individuals are saved or not.","label":"soc.religion.christian"}

Perhaps that 10th car, the one that someone, somewhere\ndissaproves of you selling and, presumably, of me buying.\n\nThat someone could go to the government and insist that the government make\nus stop it.  But the government would be powerless to stop us from doing\nwhat we like with our own property, in the abscence of fraud or agression.\nAnd it would be powerless to stop us from associating with each other.\n\nThis does not seem to me to be a utopian dream, but basic human decency\nand common sense.

He made some smart remark so I told him where he could stick it,  \nsnatched back my check and left. Needless to say, they were not pleased by  \nthe turn of events.\n\nEarly the next morning I got a call from the general sales manager wanting  \nto know what happened. I related the story and he apologised profusely and  \nasked if there was anything they could do to change my mind.

He gave me the line about hating to  \nlose a customer and they would try to find a solution, etc, etc. I told  \nhim not to bother, thanks, I'd go somewhere else.\n\nA couple hours later, the owner of the dealership called me, all  \napologetic, etc, etc, etc, and said that they would cover the $150 plus  \nknock another $400 off the price of the truck. I told him I'd think about  \nit and he gave me his private, direct phone number, his secretary's name,  \nand assured me that they valued me as a customer, etc etc etc....\n\nI thought about it for a few hours and discussed it with my wife and we  \ndecided, what the hell...that was a pretty decent deal, so I called him  \nback and accepted his offer. When I went back the next day to pick up the  \ntruck, I received the royal treatment. Everyone seemed to know about the  \nincident, even the lot boy. Everything went smoothly and I was out of  \nthere in my new truck in about 30 mins.\n\nSo, I guess I'm a reasonably satisfied customer. However, it should not  \nhave happened in the first place. I was a bit shocked to have a sales  \nperson talk to me like that. I don't expect them to bow and grovel, but I  \nsure don't expect to be given a hard time either, esp. when it's their  \nmistake.\n\nAnyway, I'm happy with the truck and it turned out to be a couple hundred  \ndollars under invoice and they paid most of the first year's license fee.  \nI'm not sure whether I'll go back to that dealer, tho.","label":"rec.autos"}

And that kind of invisibility was prevalent for the most part\nfor DePalma.  After being called up October 30 against the Tampa Bay Lightning,\nDePalma had an excellent week, scoring 5 points in 3 games while playing good\ndefense.  Unfortunately, the 27-year-old DePalma then disappeared the rest of\nthe way, getting just 3 more points in 15 more games, and generally looked\nlethargic and uninterested on both ends of the ice.  He then was sent down to\nKansas City, walked out from there, and was suspended and later reinstated\nwhen it was revealed that he was injured; he then promptly disappeared from\nthe watching eyes of Shark Bytes (as the mailing list is now known to Sharks\nofficials) faithful, and neither the Sharks nor we miss him.\n\n#10\tJOHAN GARPENLOV\t\tSeason: 3rd\nAcquired:\t'91-92, trade with Detroit for D Bob McGill and 8th round\n\t\tpick in '92 entry draft from Vancouver\nGrade:\t\tA/A-\n\nAfter an early slump, Garpenlov was nothing short of inspirational the rest\nof the way, finishing with 66 points in 79 games, second highest total on the\nteam, as he clicked well with team MVP Kelly Kisio and right wing Rob\nGaudreau.  Kisio got most of the credit, but Garpenlov, finishing second in\nthe MVP voting, clearly demonstrated his playmaking and scoring skills, as he\nwas seen making excellent centering passes as well as finishing passes to him\nby putting the puck past opposing goaltenders, getting a club-high 14 power-\nplay goals.  Contrary to his previous rep, Garpenlov also showed that despite\nhis small size (5' 11\", 183 lbs.), he was willing to throw himself around\nwhen necessary, albeit not very successful yet.  He also still needs to work\non his defense, although he improved tremendously throughout the season, and\nwas actually quite a good penalty killer by the end of the season.  He will\nbe a major key to the offense next year.\n\n#15\tDAVID BRUCE\t\tSeason: 5th\nAcquired:\t'91-92, from St. Louis in expansion draft\nGrade:\t\tI (?)\n\nAfter a banner '91-92, when he led the team in power-play goals (10) and\nwas third in total scoring (38 points in 60 games), Bruce was bothered\nvirtually all of this season with a groin injury, which kept him out of the\nlineup for all by 17 games this season.  Of course, it is difficult to\nspeculate how well he would have done this season had he not been affected by\nthe injury, but the 28-year-old Bruce was effective with a man up or a man\nshort in the Sharks' first season, and was expected to be a strong offensive\nleader this season as well.  The injury appears serious, which is a shame,\nbecause otherwise he may have a much brighter future for now; instead, his\nfuture with the Sharks next season appears clouded.\n\n#18\tMARK PEDERSON\t\tSeason:\t3rd\nAcquired:\t'92-93, trade with Philadelphia for C/LW Dave Snuggerud\nGrade:\t\tI (B)\n\nIt is difficult for me to understand the Flyers' decision to unload Pederson,\nafter a very good offensive season last season (40 points in 58 games), but\nafter riding the pine early in the season, Pederson was summarily sent to the\nSharks in exchange of the defensive-minded Snuggerud, and he finished with\n41 games combined with the Flyers and the Sharks.  He was also limited by\ninjuries this season, and this limited his production (17 points).  But when\nhealthy, Pederson appears impressive, with a good scoring touch, good size\n(and the willingness to throw it around, although he's not considered a\nphysical forward), and good speed.  He also does not appear to be a liability\non defense, but the Sharks probably have to wait until next season to see how\nmuch, exactly, Pederson can do.\n\n#20\tJOHN CARTER\t\tSeason: 4th\nAcquired:\t'91-92, free agent from Boston\nGrade:\t\tI (B+/B)\n\nCarter was definitely one of the hardest workers on the team, and the hard\nwork worked wonders, as at times he looked great on ice.  However, although he\ndid look great at times, the fact that he received just 16 points (in 55\ngames) for his efforts is a sign that there is only so much his hard work can\ndo, and the Sharks confirmed that by sending him to Kansas City with about\n20 games left in the season.  Carter, who will turn 30 on May 6, always\nhussled, but as a result, was sometimes trapped too deep within the offensive\nzone while forechecking, but he was generally a credit on the defensive end,\nbut he is probably of limited utility in that capacity, and he did not impress\noffensively, although he was one of the best Sharks at drawing penalties.  He\nis very unlikely to be back next season.\n\n#28\tJEAN-FRANCOIS QUINTIN\tSeason: 1st\nAcquired:\t'91-92, from Minnesota in dispersal draft\nGrade:\t\tI (B+/B)\n\nI don't understand why the Sharks didn't let Quintin play any more than the\n14 games he played this season.  He was generally hard-working and creating\nopportunities offensively, and appeared, at age 23, ready for regular NHL\nduty, at least for a team like the Sharks, finishing with 7 points in those\n14 games while not being a defensive liability.  Shoulder injury in training\ncamp before the '91-92 season limited Quintin, the team's leading scorer in\nexhibition games despite sitting out the final two, to just 29 games with the\nSharks and the Blades that season, but he looked impressive.  He should be a\nsolid contender for regular duty next season.\n\n#41\tMARK BEAUFAIT\t\tSeason: 1st\nAcquired:\t2nd round pick in 1991 supplemental draft\nGrade:\t\tI (?)\n\nAfter a all-star season at Kansas City, Beaufait got a cup of coffey with the\nSharks late in the season when the Blades knocked down a playoff spot and the\nSharks decimated with injuries, playing 5 games and scoring a goal for his only\nNHL point thus far.  Despite small size (5' 9\", 165 lbs.), Beaufait was not shy\nto throw himself around when necessary, and looked pretty good at times,\nalthough it's too early to judge him based on 5 NHL games, in which he played\nmostly left wing, away from his center position at Northern Michigan and\nKansas City.\n\n#42\tJAROSLAV OTEVREL\tSeason: 1st\nAcquired:\t8th round pick in 1991 entry draft\nGrade:\t\tI (?)\n\nLike Beaufait, Otevrel also played away from his normal position when he was\nup for his cup of tea (7 games) midway through the season.  He was generally\nvery much of a defensive liability, and did not show much offensively either,\nalthough that may be more indicative of the lack of ice time he got in those\n7 games.  He may need another season to work on his defense, but once his\ndefense is acceptable, he should be ready.\n\n#44\tMICHEL PICARD\t\tSeason: 1st\nAcquired:\t'92-93, trade with Hartford for LW Yvon Corriveau\nGrade:\t\tI (B-/C+)\n\nThe 23-year-old Picard, although he perennially tore up the minors, seems to\nbe close to being out of chances, for some reason, after being acquired by the\nSharks but failing to impress the management in 25 games, scoring 4 goals for\nhis only points, and he spent most of the rest of the way in Kansas City.\nHe was not particularly strong defensively, and despite his offensive\nbrilliance in the minors, he has failed thus far to score in the NHL, although\nhe has been given limited opportunities.  He may be the Sharks' bait in the\nexpansion draft.\n\n#45\tDODY WOOD\t\tSeason: 1st\nAcquired:\t3rd round pick in 1991 entry draft\nGrade:\t\tI (D+/D, although perhaps I shouldn't give a grade at all)\n\nI have been accused of knocking on Wood too much. :-)  Then, it is probably\nno surprise to you that I am thoroughly unimpressed by Wood thus far, although\n13 games is a small example.  He was generally a nonfactor on offense, was\nnot particularly good defensively, and took too many silly penalties, losing\nmany fights in the process and gathering 69 penalty minutes in those 13 games,\nprojecting to to 446(!) in an 84-game season.  He's not ready, and needs at\nleast another season at KC, where he can work on his fighting skills, if\nnothing else.  His relatively small size (5' 11\", 181 lbs.) does not give much\npossibility that he can survive, at this stage, as an enforcer.","label":"rec.sport.hockey"}

{"text":"Classify the following data: \nTrue in theory.  In practice?  The technology of cellular phones will\nprobably be spread spectrum and quite difficult to record the crypttext\nwithout the key.  If the frequency path depends on they key, as I\nunderstand it to, it *could* be made effectively impossible to record.\n\nOnce it hits land you can record it if you have telco access.  The\ntelco isn't supposed to give that without a warrant.  That's the rule\ntoday.\n\nBut even so, the evidence would not be admissible, I think, unless the\njudge so ordered.  I think that even interception of the crypttext\nwithout a warrant would be illegal.   Cops can't record today's plain\ncellular calls and then ask a judge, \"Hey, can we have permission to\nlisten to those tapes?\" can they?\n\n\nYes, that is a major concern, but I think that they think they can\nwin just by having 99.5% of the USA use this system.  They don't even\nhave to care about the cautious .5% that's left.  They don't catch the\nreally smart crooks anyway.   John Gotti, who would have to be retarded\nnot to realize he was likely to be wiretapped, glibly chatted away\non his tapped phone about murder plans.  That's why he's in jail now.\nHard to believe, but true.\n\n\nThis scheme can succeed without laws forbidding more, which people would\nfight a lot harder.  They like this enough that they are dropping the so\ncalled \"Digital Telephony\" proposal, according to rumours.  However the\nmeaning of that is complex, since they still want to get at the crypttext\non telco systems, and that requires a bit of work.","label":"sci.crypt"}

{"text":"Classify the following data: From: Center for Policy Research <cpr>\nSubject: Unconventional peace proposal\n\n\nA unconventional proposal for peace in the Middle-East.\n---------------------------------------------------------- by\n\t\t\t  Elias Davidsson\n\nThe following proposal is based on the following assumptions:\n\n1.      Fundamental human rights, such as the right to life, to\neducation, to establish a family and have children, to human\ndignity, the right to free movement, to free expression, etc. are\nmore important to human existence that the rights of states.\n\n2.      In the event of a conflict between basic human rights and\nrights of collectivities, basic human rights should prevail.\n\n3.      Between the collectivities defining themselves as\nJewish-Israeli and Palestinian-Arab, however labelled, an\nunresolved conflict exists.\n\n4.      This conflict has caused great sufferings for millions of\npeople. It moreover poisons relations between communities, peoples\nand nations.\n\n5.      Each year, the United States expends billions of dollars\nin economic and military aid to the conflicting parties.\n\n6.      Attempts to solve the Israeli-Arab conflict by traditional\npolitical means have failed.\n\n7.      As long as the conflict is perceived as that between two\ndistinct ethnical/religious communities/peoples which claim the\nland, there is no just nor peaceful solution possible.\n\n8.      Love between human beings can be capitalized for the sake\nof peace and justice. When people love, they share.\n\nHaving stated my assumptions, I will now state my proposal.\n\n1.      A Fund should be established which would disburse grants\nfor each child born to a couple where one partner is Israeli-Jew\nand the other Palestinian-Arab.\n\n2.      To be entitled for a grant, a couple will have to prove\nthat one of the partners possesses or is entitled to Israeli\ncitizenship under the Law of Return and the other partner,\nalthough born in areas under current Isreali control, is not\nentitled to such citizenship under the Law of Return.\n\n3.      For the first child, the grant will amount to $18.000. For\nthe second the third child, $12.000 for each child. For each\nsubsequent child, the grant will amount to $6.000 for each child.\n\n\n4.      The Fund would be financed by a variety of sources which\nhave shown interest in promoting a peaceful solution to the\nIsraeli-Arab conflict, including the U.S. Government, Jewish and\nChristian organizations in the U.S.  and a great number of\ngovernments and international organizations.\n\n5.      The emergence of a considerable number of 'mixed'\nmarriages in Israel/Palestine, all of whom would have relatives on\n'both sides' of the divide, would make the conflict lose its\nethnical and unsoluble core and strengthen the emergence of a\ntruly civil society. The existence of a strong 'mixed' stock of\npeople would also help the integration of Israeli society into the\nMiddle-East in a graceful manner.\n\nObjections to this proposal will certainly be voiced. I will\nattempt to identify some of these:\n\n1.      The idea of providing financial incentives to selected\nforms of partnership and marriage, is not conventional. However,\nit is based on the concept of affirmative action, which is\nrecognized as a legitimate form of public policy to reverse the\nperverse effects of segregation and discrimination. International\nlaw clearly permits affirmative action when it is aimed at\nreducing racial discrimination and segregation.\n\n2.      It may be objected that the Israeli-Palestinian conflict\nis not primarily a religious or ethnical conflict, but that it is\na conflict between a colonialist settler society and an indigenous\ncolonized society that can only regain its freedom by armed\nstruggle. This objection is based on the assumption that the\n'enemy' is not Zionism as ideology and practice, but\nIsraeli-Jewish society and its members which will have to be\ndefeated. This objection has no merit because it does not fulfill\nthe first two assumptions concerning the primacy of fundamental\nhuman rights over collective rights (see above)\n\n3.      Fundamentalist Jews would certainly object to the use of\nfinancial incentives to encourage 'mixed marriages'. From their\npoint of view, the continued existence of a specific Jewish People\noverrides any other consideration, be it human love, peace of\nhuman rights.  The President of the World Jewish Congress, Edgar\nBronfman, reflected this view a few years ago in an interview he\ngave to Der Spiegel, a German magazine. He called the increasing\nassimilation of Jews in the world a <calamity>, comparable in its\neffects only with the Holocaust. This objection has no merit\neither because it does not fulfill the first two assumptions (see\nabove)\n\n4.      It may objected that only a few people in\nIsrael/Palestine, would request such grants and that it would thus\nnot serve its purpose. To this objection one might respond that\nalthough it is not possible to determine with certainty the effect\nof such a proposal, the existence of such a Fund would help mixed\ncouples to resist the pressure of their respective societies and\nencourage young couples to reject fundamentalist and racist\nattitudes.\n\n5.      It may objected that such a Fund would need great sums to\nbring about substantial demographic changes. This objection has\nmerits. However, it must be remembered that huge sums, more than\n$3 billion, are expended each year by the United States government\nand by U.S. organizations to maintain an elusive peace in the\nMiddle-East through armaments. A mere fraction of these sums would\nsuffice to launch the above proposal and create a more favorable\nclimate towards the existence of 'mixed' marriages in\nIsrael/Palestine, thus encouraging the emergence of a\nnon-segregated society in that worn-torn land.\n\nI would be thankful for critical comments to the above proposal as\nwell for any dissemination of this proposal for meaningful\ndiscussion and enrichment.","label":"talk.politics.mideast"}

Since\nX    1984, this contest demonstrated that a program that simply works\nX    correctly is not sufficient.

The rules, and sometimes the contest Email\nX    address itself, change over time.  A valid entry one year may\nX    be rejected in a later year due to changes in the rules.  The typical\nX    start date for contests is in early March.  Contest rules are normally not\nX    finalized and posted until the beginning of the contest.  The typical\nX    closing date for contests are in early May.\nX\nX    The rules and the guidelines may (and often do) change from year to\nX    year.  You should be sure you have the current rules and guidelines\nX    prior to submitting entries.

(Rom. 4:6-8)\n\nThe biblical perspective seems to be that foregiveness and covering are\nparallel/equivalent concepts in both testaments.  The dispensational\ndistinction is unwarranted.\n\n\nI'm sure Rex has Scripture to back this up.  You're suggesting Jesus is\ngoing to travel around dealing with individual violations of His law -- for\nmillions perhaps billions of people.  Such activity for Moses the lawgiver\nwas considered unwise (cf. Ex. 18:13ff).

Those letters don't provide \"concrete proof\" of anything at all\nin the absence of any case law that demonstrates the method will actu-\nally work for ordinary people in everyday situations.\n\nSpecifically, show us some case law in which the courts have ruled that\nincome tax is illegal and/or that ordinary working types do not have to\npay income tax (and that they can legally avoid paying income tax with-\nout declaring themselves to be churches or some such silliness).  This\nissue is sufficiently important that I think we have a right to expect\nsomething squarely on point from the US Supreme Court (in the case of\nfederal tax) or a state's supreme court (for a state's income tax).\n\nUnless you can do that, I for one am unwilling to call your material\n\"concrete proof\".\n\n\tThere has been no refutation to date.  Have the nay-sayers\n\tfinally given up as defeated?  Sure would like to hear their\n\treasons for disbelief at this point.\n\nRefutation??  Refutation of what?  You haven't made a case yet.  You've\nposted plenty of claims, but you haven't given us any valid reason to\nbelieve that any court in the US will agree with you.  Your claims seem\non the surface to deviate so radically from the legal mainstream that I\nfeel the burden of proof is still on =you= to show that your arguments\nhave any merit whatsoever.  And the cases you've cited involve such\nstrange situations that I see no reason to assume that the rulings are\napplicable to anyone else, or that they will ultimately stand on appeal\nto the Supreme Court.\n\nWhy can't you just cite us a case in which Joe Schmoe, a regular\nemployee earning regular wages from a regular company, refuses to pay\nhis income tax, gets hauled into court, is convicted of wilful tax eva-\nsion, and then has his conviction overturned by the US Supreme Court\nwith a landmark 7-2 majority ruling that income tax is indeed totally\nvoluntary?  What, you say?  No such case exists?  Hmmm, I wonder why\nnot; why haven't you?\n\n\tShall I conclude that the point has been received and the\n\topposition has forfeited the field?\n\nWith all due respect, you can conclude anything you want.  I just hope,\nfor your own sake, that you don't conclude that anyone in a position of\nauthority in the United States or any legitimate or illegitimate polit-\nical subdivision thereof is going to agree with your conclusions.\n\nFor that matter, I confess I'm thoroughly confused as to =why= you would\nbe looking for court rulings in your favor anyway -- since I thought you\ntold us earlier that every court in the US has been in cahoots with big\nbanking interests since the 1938 \"admiralty jurisdiction\" coverup thing.\nDo you honestly expect us to believe that they'd go to all the trouble\nto subvert the system, and yet would still promptly slink back into\ntheir burrows in the face of anyone who knew enough to invoke the right\ncombination of magic spells and mystic mumbo-jumbo?\n\nNot only that, but why do you even =care= what the US courts say anyway?\nDidn't you tell us a while back that you've disavowed all attempts by US\nofficials to classify you as a \"14th Amendment federal citizen\"?  When\nthe FBI comes to haul you away for tax evasion, why don't you just tell\nthem they're out of their jurisdiction and should go back to Washington,\nD.C., where they belong?\n\nOr maybe we should all just go back to mediaeval common law, which you\nsuggested would be better than all these statutes, codes, and the like.\nIf you want to renounce society's legal framework, fine; we can just\ndeclare you an outlaw, OK?, and anyone who sees you driving on the roads\nwith no license plate on your car and no driver's license in your wallet\ncan just take you like a game animal and stew you for their supper (with\nplenty of veggies and a pinch of salt, but WITHOUT PREJUDICE UCC 1-207).\n\nSorry, everyone, it's getting late, and I'm sick and tired of all this\ngarbage.  If I know what's good for me, I'll just clam up and stop try-\ning to refute this nonsense, and if anyone falls for it and winds up in\njail for tax evasion or what-not, it'll be on their own head.\n\nNeedless to say, none of the above represents the opinions of my current\nemployer -- who, in any case, is a Canadian and doesn't really need to\ncare too much about US tax law.  I, on the other hand, am a \"14th Amend-\nment federal citizen\", with a US passport to prove it, and plan to keep\non filing Form 1040's for the foreseeable future (though I will probably\nnot owe any US income tax due to the foreign earned income exclusion\nand/or the foreign tax credit).\n","label":"talk.politics.misc"}

The other important feature\nis to disable repetitive waveform acquisition i.e. being able to lock\nthe instrument into real time capture mode.\n\n\nI agree with you here. The only consolation is that manufacturers are\n_beginning_ to pay attention to ergonomics when designing the menus.\nHowever, to be fair, it seems that first time scope users (our students)\nseem to adjust to menus easier than navigating around the twenty or\nmore knobs required of a \"real\" scope :-)\n\n\nThis is one area that newer DSOs are addressing.

This instrument has\na 100MHz, 500Ms/s spec, meaning that it is _always_ in real time\ncapture mode. The pricing also matches equivalent analogue scopes in\nthe range. The downer is that the instrument uses menus again, but at\nleast they appear to be logically laid out.\n\nOne more thing about the new, \"simpler\", front panels. These instruments\ntend to use digital rotary encoders as knobs now. This is a vast improvement\nover the old oak switch.

Reproduced without permission.]\n\n\n\nDigression 6.1:  Miracle Berries and the Modification of Taste Receptors\n\nAlthough the _miracle berry_, a plant native to West Africa is practically\ntasteless, it temporarily changes the taste of other substances.  Miracle\nberries contain a protein, _miraculin_, that modifies sweet receptors in\nsuch a way that they can be stimulated by acids (Bartoshuk, Gentile, \nMoskowitz, & Meiselman, 1974).  If you ever get a chance to chew a miracle\nberry (and I do recommend it), for about the next half an hour all acids \n(which are normally sour) will taste sweet.  They will continue to taste\nsour as well.\n\nMiraculin was, for a time, commercially available in the United States as a\ndiet aid.  The idea was that dieters could coat their tongue with a miraculin\npill and then eat and drink unsweetened, slightly acidic substances.  Such\nsubstances would taste sweet without providing many calories.\n\nA colleague and I once spent an evening experimenting with miracle berries.\nWe drank straight lemon juice, sauerkraut juice, even vinegar.  All tasted\nextremely sweet.  Somehow we forgot how acidic these substances are.  We \nawoke the next day to find our mouths full of ulcers.\n\n[... continued discussion of a couple other taste-altering substances ...]\n\n\nRefs:  \n\nBartoshuk, L.M., Gentile, R.L., Moskowitz, H.R., & Meiselman, H.L.

{"text":"Classify the following data: \nThis a \"tried and true\" method utilized by guerilla and terrorists groups:\nto conduct operations in the midst of the local populace, thus forcing the\nopposing \"state\" to possible harm innocent civilians in their search or,\nin order to avoid the deaths of civilians, abandon the search. Certainly the\npeople who use the population for cover are *also* to blaim for dragging the\ninnocent civilians into harm's way.\n\nAre you suggesting that, when guerillas use the population for cover, Israel\nshould totally back down? So...the easiest way to get away with attacking\nanother is to use an innocent as a shield and hope that the other respects\ninnocent lives?\n\n\nYour damn right Israel insists on some sort of \"demilitarized\" or \"buffer\"\nzone. Its had to put up with too many years of attacks from the territory\nof Arab states and watched as the states did nothing. It is not exactly\nsurprizing that Israel decided that the only way to stop such actions is to \ndo it themselves.\n\n\nWhat? So the whole bit about attacks on Israel from neighboring Arab states \ncan start all over again? While I also hope for this to happen, it will\nonly occur WHEN Arab states show that they are *prepared* to take on the \nresponsibility and the duty to stop guerilla attacks on Israel from their \nsoil. They have to Prove it (or provide some \"guaratees\"), there is no way\nIsrael is going to accept their \"word\"- not with their past attitude of \ntolerance towards \"anti-Israel guerillas in-residence\".\n\nGood lord, Brad. What in the world goves you the idea that UN troops stop\nanything? They are ONLY stationed in a country because that country allows\nthem in. It can ask them to leave *at any time*; as Nasser did in '56 and\n'67. Somehow, with that \"limitation\" on the troops \"powers\" I don't\nthink that Israel is going to be any more comfortable. Without a *genuine* commitment to peace from the Arab states, and concrete (not intellectual or political exercises in jargon) \"guarantees\" by other parties, the UN is worthless\nto Israel (but, perhaps useful as a \"ruse\"?).\n\n\nPerhaps you are aware that, to most communities of people, there is\nthe feeling that it is better that \"many of us die fighting\nagainst those who attack us than for few to die while we silently \naccept our fate.\" If,however, you call on Israel to see the sense of \nsuffering fewer casualties, I suggest you apply the same to Palestinian,\nArab and Islamic groups.\n\n\nFrom Israel's perspective, \"concessions\" gets it NOTHING...except the \nrealization that it has given \"something\" up and now *can only \nhope* that the other side decides to do likewise. Words *can be taken\nback* by merely doing so; to \"take back\" tangible items (land,\ncontrol of land) requires the sort of action you say Israel should\nstay away from.\n \nIsrael put up with attacks from Arab state territories for decades \nbefore essentially putting a stop to it through its invasion of Lebanon.\nThe entire basis of that reality was exactly as you state above: 1) Israel \nwould express outrage at these attacks and protest to the Arab state \ninvolved, 2) that state promptly ignored the entire matter, secure \nin the knowledge that IT could not be held responsible for the acts \ncommitted by \"private groups\", 3) Israel would prepare for the next \nround of attacks. What would Israel want to return to those days (and\ndon't be so idiotic as to suggest \"trust\" for the motivations of\npresent-day Arab states)?\n\nAh, ok...what is \"different\" about the present situation that tells\nus that the Arab states will *not* pursue their past antagonistic \npolicies towards Israel? Now, don't talk about vague \"political factors\"\nbut about those \"tangible\" (just like that which Israel gave up)\nfactors that \"guarantee\" the responsibility of those states. Your\nassessment of \"difference\" here is based on a whole lot of assumptions,\nand most states don't feel confortable basing their existence on that\nsort of thing.\n\n\nIt has not. Without the support, and active involvement, of Syria,\nLebanon would not have been able to accomplish all that has occurred.\nOnce Syria leaves who is to say that Lebanon will be able to retain \ncontrol? If Syria stays thay may be even more dangerous for Israel.\nTim","label":"talk.politics.mideast"}

{"text":"Classify the following data: Center for Policy Research writes...\n\n\n\n    Your comparison with the Warsaw Ghetto uprising is insulting,\n    and racist beyond belief.  The attempts to quiet any violence\n    in the Gaza Strip are just that.  The efforts to quell murder\n    and mayhem in the Gaza strip were the resluts of violence and\n    came AFTER the violence.  It was not an arbitrary racial move\n    like the nazi treatment of Jews.  Jews had NOT committed acts\n    of violence and murder as have the residents of Gaza.  I find \n    your eagerness to ignore the acts of murder nothing more than\n    anti-Israel bigotry.\n\n\n\n    It is NOT punishment, but protection from repeated attacks by\n    residents of Gaza.  You self-servingly omit any references to\n    WHY Israel has had to take action.  Apparaently the deaths of\n    innocent Israeli civilians do not enter into your equation, a\n    racist ommission on your part.\n\n\n\n    The right of Israel to protect its citizens from murderers is\n    also recognized by international law.  Israeli civilians have\n    been getting stabbed to death on a daily basis.  If this wave\n    of murder does not matter to you, then your posturing for the\n    basic human rights you claim matter so much to you is nothing\n    but an anti-Israel charade.\n\n\n\n    Do you know of residents of Gaza who have applied for Israeli\n    citizenship and were denied?  I have heard of no such denials\n    taking place.  Can you document this, or is this more of your\n    stupid and innacurate propaganda?  The truth is that if Gazan\n    residents applied for citizenship, HAMAS would murder them as\n    collaborators.\n\n\n\t     Many Gazans are born in towns and villages located in\n\n    How dare you use such a disgusting phrase.  How very easy you\n    attack a people, when you omit facts which fly in the face of\n    your pure racism.  Perhaps you are judging a people to be the\n    racists that you are.  Do you believe that all Jews must have   \n    the same bigoted makeup as you?  \n    \n    Here's another little fly in your ointment, about the 'master \n    race,' for you to avoid...\n\n    Two months ago a plane with 86 Bosnian Muslims left Bosnia to\n    seek asylum in the middle east.  Four Arab nations refused to\n    grant them asylum.  Then when Israli Arabs agreed to take the\n    responsibility for them, they were allowed into Israel.  Yes,\n    Israel.  But when the plane landed, the Israeli Arabs who had\n    previously agreed to take care of them refused to be involved\n    with the rescue project, because they felt that it would make\n    Israel look good.  It was more important to avoid any good PR\n    for Israel than to take care of fellow Muslims.  Israel moved\n    them to a kibbutz, where they are safe and secure.  The truth\n    is that time after time the Islamic world has turned its back\n    on Muslims in need more than Israel has.  Even in the case of\n    the 400 deportees, Lebanon was willing to let their so-called\n    Arab brothers freeze to death rather than give them sanctuary\n    in Lebanon.  \n\n    Nearly twice as many Palestinians have been murdered by other\n    Palestinians than in confrontations with Israel.  Hundreds of\n    thousands of Palestinians had been deported from Kuwait, just\n    because they were Palestinian.  The truth is that your phoney\n    concern for the welfare of the Palestinians is nothing but an\n    excuse to attack Israel.  You are part of the ignorant effort\n    to confine all concern for the welfare of the Palestinians to\n    attacking Israel.  But the truth is there are greater reasons\n    than Israel for the plight of the Palestinians.  To disregard\n    Jordan or Kuwait or Saudi Arabia or any of the other oil-rich \n    nations who do nothing for these people, is to use the plight \n    of these poor people as a vehicle for your hatred of Jews, or\n    your hatred of Israel.  Anti-semitism and anti-Zionism is NOT\n    the same as pro-Palestinian and anyone who insists that it is\n    the same really does not give two hoots for their welfare.\n\n\n\n    Your pathetic analogy is so absent of relevant fact that your\n    racism cannot be disguised.  Jews had never declared war on a\n    Polish people.  Jews had never attacked Poles with knives, or\n    had used the Ghetto as a staging ground for attacks.  To take\n    something like the Warsaw Ghetto(the creation of which you do\n    not even bother to discuss!)and the uprising that followed is\n    to degrade the dead, and to show that intelligent debate on a \n    difficult situation is beyond your intellectual purview.  You\n    clearly have never even read a single word of the Covenant of \n    the Islamic Resistance Movement.  Here is arguably the single\n    most anti-semitic genocidal document since Mein Kampf, yet it\n    is totally disregarded in your rantings.  Your racism is most\n    evident in your eagerness to avoid such documentation.  If it\n    were considered, you might actually have to deal with mideast\n    problems in a balanced manner, rather than in an anti-semitic\n    manner.\n\n\n\n    And just how was Gaza obtained?  Do you forget that Israel is\n    not in the habit of grabbing land for the hell of it, but had\n    taken Gaza in a war that it did not start?  Did you know land\n    Israel captures in wars, wars which other nations have ALWAYS\n    started, aren't the same as Israel, and they are subject to a \n    completely different set of international laws?  Since you do\n    continuously refer to international law, would you please say\n    what specific international laws Israel is violating?  \n    \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t   This attitude\n\n    I can cite 6,000,000 reasons why it is not.\n\n\n\n    Where is this quote?  I have never heard Rabin assert that he\n    wished such a thing.  Since you are in general a liar, you'll\n    have to provide the entire quote, with source, or this effort\n    will be regarded as just another one of your fabrications.\n\n\n\n    Only you are led to ask such a loaded, racist, intellectually\n    dishonest question.  You inability to come to terms with what\n    you are has turned you into a racist of the highest order.\n\n\n\n    Why do you not feel the same compassion for the Jews of Iran,\n    or Iraq, or Yemen, or Saudi Arabia, or Syria?  Do you have an\n    inkling of what they have endured over the past decades?  Or,\n    what about the plight of the Palestinians in Kuwait?  Or what\n    about the treatment of the Bosnian Muslims?  Do you think the\n    residents of Gaza are being subjected to what all the Muslims \n    in Bosnia are enduring?  Why are you indifferent to the death\n    and suffering of people?  Why do you not care that these folk\n    are being exterminated?  Why do you not care that only Israel\n    has given any of these people safe haven?  Could it be due to \n    the fact that it is not Israel who is doing the killing?  The\n    people in Gaza are not being exterminated.  They aren't being\n    killed.  They aren't being raped.  They aren't being starved.\n    They aren't being driven from their lands.  They are not kept\n    from receiving food or other supplies.  But the Bosnians are.\n    And the ONLY country which has provided some sanctuary to the\n    Bosnian Muslims is the same nation that you have devoted your \n    life to attacking, in the guise of compassion.    \n\n    Your rantings are so unfettered by the burden of intellectual\n    honesty that you ought to take a deep breath and ask yourself\n    what your real motives are.  Do not flatter yourself into the\n    belief that truth or compassion are what drives you.  In your\n    case, it is clear that hate beats out love every time.  Maybe\n    you are burdened with some kind of guilt for having been born\n    a Jew.  It is obvious that your hatred of your own Judaism is\n    being dumped on all other Jews.  Why else would you suggest a\n    racist idea like breeding Jews out of existence?  Maybe these\n    fits of anti-semitism are a result of being cut off from your \n    own people for an extended period.  Whatever the case may be, \n    it is clear that you are not what you have labored so hard to \n    appear to be.  When you realize that you can't care for other \n    people while you hate yourself you might actually begin to do \n    some good.","label":"talk.politics.mideast"}

{"text":"Classify the following data: I'm quite astonished, shocked, and appalled at this serious frontal \nassault on emerging American freedoms.  The Clinton administration \nnor any other government agency has any legitimate role whatsoever \nin regulating cryptography. To do so is tantamount to regulating \n`acceptable' speech, and is blatantly unconstitutional. Perhaps we \nshould rename this year `1984' in honor of such an illustrious \nproposal.  Let the Crappy Chip live in infamy, and the adminstration\nreceive great shame and discredit for this bizarre misadventure.\n\nI am outraged that my tax money is being used to develop technology\nto restrict my freedoms far beyond reasonable measures.  The U.S.\ngovernment will have my full uncooperation and disobedience on any\nserious threat to my liberties such as this, and I call on everyone\nwith an interest in a sensible government to resist and defy this \nproposal.  The administration does not seem to understand that they\nare merely a subservient instrument to implement the will of the\npublic, and hence anyone involved in this proposal in this respect is \nwholly negligent and remiss in performing their lawful duty.\n\n\nIt seems to me that U.S. Diplomatic communications should be \ntappable by the U.N. whenever any countries produce a warrant to\nthe U.N.  In fact, I think we should stop paying the NSA billions\nof dollars a year to produce unbreakable codes for this reason.\nThese actions violate the sovereignity of international law. (I hope\nMr. Clinton is shrewd enough to recognize my sarcasm and satire here.\nBut if he isn't, it's a modest and reasonable proposal, so he should\nfind merit with it nevertheless.)\n\nCryptography is neutral technology. If everybody has strong \ncryptography (including policemen, bureacrats, businessmen, \nhousewives, thugs and hoodlums), we have a sustainable \nequilibrium.  Anything less is an unworkable anti-egaltarian \narrangement, intrinsically antithetical to American freedoms, and\nguaranteed to collapse under its own weight of inherent \nimpracticality. We don't need to compromise on issues of freedom.\n\n\nFor too long our government has demonstrated itself to be \nincreasingly hostile and a serious obstacle to economic vitality \nand protecting Americans.\n\n\nIt is not possible for the Federal Government\nto ``act quickly'' or develop ``consistent, comprehensive\npolicies'' PERIOD.  And even if by some grandiose miracle such\na thing were possible, it would only be an efficient way to\ndeprive American citizens of fundamental and inalienable rights.\n\nThe administration has to be committed to leaving private \nindustries alone, esp. on this issue.  The government has no \nlegitimate role in regulating the content of communications.\nLaw enforcement agencies must be prepared to forfeit their\nsurveillance bludgeon; they are soon and inevitably to be \ndisarmed of it. \n\n\nNo such laws can be constitutionally sound, and this is equivalent\nto a veiled threat, which I don't appreciate.  This kind of \nextortion tends to agitate me and others into radicalism. I will\ntrade threats for threats, and violation for violation.\n\n\nIf the administration did say this, it would find itself \nimpeached for reckless and outrageous disregard of essential,\nestablished, entrenched, and explicit constitutional privacy \nguarantees. The administration would have no legal standing \nwhatsoever; such an action would be egregiously illegal and\ncriminal, and wholly untolerated and disregarded by vast \nsegments of the population.\n\n\nThe U.S., comprised of a vast majority of people fanatically \ncommitted to preserving their privacy in the face of an \nincreasingly totalitarian government, is saying just that.  \nTake your chips and give them to NSA employees as Christmas bonuses.\nWe can run any algorithm on our computers we damn well please, \nand we will make any chips we please, and we will send any bit \npattern over our data highways we please. And if you try to stop \nus, you will be gradually or abruptly dissolved into nothingness.\n\n[privacy vs. law enforcement]\n\nThis is an outright Dingaling Denning lie.  The two aims of\nprivacy and surveillance are intrinsically and fundamentally \nincompatible, and you have to work for the NSA to think otherwise. \nAmericans are about to discover ways, through the use of technology, \nto preserve their inalienable but forgotten freedoms that have slowly \nbeen eroded away by an increasingly distant and unresponsive and \n*unrepresentative* government.\n\n--","label":"sci.crypt"}

{"text":"Classify the following data: [With Frank's permission, I have added some information here (and in\none case changed the order of his contributions) in order to clarify\nthe historical relationship of the views.  My comments are based\nprimarily on William Rusch's historical summary in \"The Trinitarian\nControversy\", Fortress.  I'm going to save this as an FAQ.  --clh]\n\nMAJOR VIEWS OF THE TRINITY\n \n[SECOND CENTURY\n\nThe writers of the 2nd Cent. are important, because they set up much\nof the context for the later discussions.  Justin Martyr, Aristides,\nAthenagoras, Tatian, and Theophilus of Antioch are known as the\n\"Apologists\".  Their theology has often been described as \"Logos\ntheology\".  Based strongly on wording in John, they took more or less\na two-phase approach.  Through eternity, the Logos was with the\nFather, as his mind or thought.  This \"immanent Word\" became\n\"expressed\" as God revealed himself in history, ultimately in Jesus.\nThus Jesus' full distinction from the Father only became visible in\nhistory, though the Logos had been present in God from eternity.\nRusch regards this view is containing many of the emphases of the\nfinal orthodox position, but in a form which is less sophisticated,\nbecause it did not have the technical language to properly deal with\nthe eternal plurality in the Godhead.\n\nIrenaeus held views somewhat similar to the Apologists.  However he\nwas uncomfortable with the two-stage approach.  He still viewed God as\none personage, with distinctions that did not become fully visible\nexcept through his process of self-revelation (the \"economy\").  The\ndistinctions are present in his essential nature.  Irenaeus emphasized\nthe Holy Spirit more than the Apologists.  Irenaeus' views should\nprobably be called \"economic trinitarianism\", though that term is\nnormally used (as below) to refer to later developments.\n\n\nTHIRD CENTURY\n\n--clh]\n\nDynamic Monarchianism\n \nSource: Theodotus\nAdherents: Paul of Samosota, Artemon, Socinus, Modern Unitarians\nPerception of God's Essence: The unity of God denotes both oneness of nature\nand oneness of person. The Son and the Holy Spirit therefore are\nconsubstantial with the Father's divine essence only as impersonal attributes.\nThe divine dunamis came upon the man Jesus, but he was not God in the strict\nsense of the word.\nPerception of God's Subsistence: The notion of a subsistent God is a palpable\nimpossibility, since his perfect unity is perfectly indivisible. The\n'diversity' of God is apparent and not real, since the Christ event and the\nwork of the Holy Spirit attest only to a dynamic operation within God, not to\na hypostatic union.\nAsignation of Deity/Eternality:\n Father: Unique originator of the universe. He is eternal, self-existent, and\nwithout beginning or end.\n Son: A virtuous (but finite) man in whose life God was dynamically present in\na unique way; Christ definitely was not deity though his humanity was deified.\n Holy Spirit: An impersonal attribute of the Godhead. No deity or eternality\nis ascribed to the Holy Spirit.\nCriticism(s): Elevates reason above the witness of biblical revelation\nconcerning the Trinity. Categorically denies the deity of Christ and of the\nHoly Spirit, thereby undermining the theological undergirding for the biblical\ndoctrine of salvation.\n[In summary, this probably best thought of as not being Trinitarianism\nat all.  God is an undifferentiated one.  Son and Holy Spirit are seen\nas simply names for the man Jesus and the grace of God active in the\nChurch.  --clh]\n\n \nModalistic Monarchianism\n \nSource: Praxeas\nAdherents: Noatus, Sabellius, Swedenborg, Scleiermacher, United Pentecostals\n(Jesus Only)\nPerception of God's Essence: The unity of God is ultra-simplex. He is\nqualitatively characterized in his essence by one nature and person.  This\nessence may be designated interchangeably as Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.\nThey are different names for but identical with the unified, simplex God. The\nthree names are the three modes by which God reveals Himself.\nPerception of God's Subsistence: The concept of a subsistent God is erroneous\nand confounds the real issue of the phenomenon of God's modalistic manifesting\nof himself. The paradox of a subsisting \"three in oneness\" is refuted by\nrecognizing that God is not three persons but one person with three different\nnames and corresponding roles following one another like parts of a drama.\nAsignation of Deity/Eternality:\n Father: Fully God and fully eternal as the primal mode or manifestation of\nthe only unique and unitary God\n Son: Full deity/eternality ascribed only in the sense of his being another\nmode of the one God and identical with his essence. he is the same God\nmanifested in temporal sequence specific to a role (incarnation).\n Holy Spirit: Eternal God only as the tile designates the phase in which the\none God, in temporal sequence, manifested himself pursuant to the role of\nregeneration and sanctification.\nCriticism(s): Depersonalizes the Godhead. To compensate for its Trinitarian\ndeficiencies, this view propounds ideas that are clearly heretical. Its\nconcept of successive manifestations of the Godhead cannot account for such\nsimultaneous appearances of the three persons as at Christ's baptism.\n[Rusch comments that evidence on these beliefs is sketchy.  There are\nactually two slightly different groups included: Noetus and his\nfollowers, and Sabellius.  Noetus was apparently more extreme.\nSabellius followed him, and attempted to use some features of economic\nTrinitarianism to create a more sophisticated view.  Unfortunately,\ninformation about Sabellius comes from a century later, and there\nseems to be some confusion between him and Marcellus of Ancyra. --clh]\n \n[I've moved the following description to be with the other\nthird-century views.  It originally appeared near the end.  --clh]\n\n\"Economic\" Trinitarianism\n \nSource: Hippolytus, Tertullian\nAdherents: Various \"neo-economic\" Trinitarians\nPerception of God's Essence: The Godhead is characterized by triunity: Father,\nSon, and Holy Spirit are the three manifestations of one identical,\nindivisible substance. The perfect unity and consubstantiality are especially\ncomprehended in such manifest Triadic deeds as creation and redemption.\nPerception of God's Subsistence: Subsistence within the Godhead is articulated\nby means of such terms as \"distinction\" and \"distribution\" dispelling\neffectively the notion of separateness or division.\nAsignation of Deity/Eternality:\nThe equal deity of Father, Son, and Holy Spirit is clearly elucidated in\nobservation of the simultaneous relational/operational features of the\nGodhead. Co-eternality, at times, does not intelligibly surface in this\nambiguous view, but it seems to be a logical implication.\nCriticism(s): Is more tentative and ambiguous in its treatment of the\nrelational aspect of the Trinity.\n[Note that this is a development of the Apologists and Irenaeus, as\nmentioned above.  As with them, the threeness is visible primarily in\nthe various ways that God revealed himself in history.  However they\ndid say that this is a manifestation of a plurality that is somehow\npresent in the Godhead from the beginning.  Tertullian talks of\nthe Father, Son, and Holy Spirit as being three that are one in\nsubstance.  Many people regard this view as being essentially\northodox, but with less developed philosophical categories.  --clh]\n\n[Origen, developing further an approach started by Clement, attempted\nto apply neo-Platonism to Christian thought.  He set many of the terms\nof the coming battle.  In Platonic fashion, he sees the Son as a\nmediator, mediating between the absolute One of God and the plurality\nof creating beings.  The Son is generated, but he is \"eternally\ngenerated\".  That is, the relationship between Father and Son is\neternal.  It cannot be said that \"there was once when he was not\" (a\nphrase that will haunt the discussion for centuries).  Having the Son\nis intrinsic to his concept of God.  The Father and Son are described\nas separate \"hypostases\", though this may not have quite the meaning\nof separate subsistence that it had in some contexts.  The union is\none of love and action, but there is some reason to think that he may\nhave used the term homoousios (\"of the same substance\").  The Holy\nSpirit is also an active, personal substance, originated by the Father\nthrough the Son.  Origen's intent is trinitarian, not tritheistic, but\nhe pushes things in the direction of separateness.\n\n\nFOURTH CENTURY\n\n--clh]\n\nSubordinationism  [often called Arianism --clh]\n \nSource: Arius\nMajor Adherents: Modern Jehovah's Witnesses, and several other lesser known\ncults\nPerception of God's Essence: The inherent oneness of God's nature is properly\nidentifiable with the Father only. The Son and the Holy Spirit are discreet\nentities who do not share the divine essence.\nPerception of God's Subsistence: The unipersonal essence of God precludes the\nconcept of divine subsistence with a Godhead. \"Threeness in oneness\" is self-\ncontradictory and violates biblical principles of a monotheistic God.\nAsignation of Deity/Eternality:\n Father: The only one, unbegotten God who is eternal and without beginning.\n Son: A created being and therefore not eternal. Though he is to be venerated,\nhe is not of the divine essence.\n Holy Spirit: A nonpersonal, noneternal emanation of the Father. He is viewed\nas an influence, an expression of God.  Deity is not ascribed to him.\nCriticism(s): It is at variance with abundant scriptural testimony respecting\nthe deity of both Christ and the Holy Spirit. Its hierarchial concept likewise\nasserts three essentially separate persons with regard to the Father, Christ,\nand the Holy Spirit. This results in a totally confused soteriology.\n[Note also that in most versions of this view, the Son is not fully\nhuman either.  He is supernatural and sinless.  That distinguishes this\nview from adoptionism.  --clh]\n \nOrthodox Trinitarianism\n \nSource: Athanasius\nAdherents: Basil, Gregory of Nyssa, Gregory of Nazianzus, Augustine, Thomas\nAquinas, Luther, Calvin, Contemporary orthodox Christianity\nPerception of God's Essence: God's being is perfectly unified and simplex: of\none essence.  This essence of deity is held in common by Father, Son, and Holy\nSpirit. The three persons are consubstantial, coinherent, co-equal, and co-\neternal.\nPerception of God's Subsistence: The divine subsistence is said to occur in\nthree modes of being or hypostases. As such, the Godhead exists \"undivided in\ndivided persons.\" This view contemplates an identity in nature and cooperation\nin function without the denial of distinctions of persons in the Godhead.\nAsignation of Deity/Eternality:\nIn its final distillation, this view unhesitatingly sets forth Father, Son,\nand Holy Spirit as co-equal and co-eternal in the Godhead with regard to both\nthe divine essence and function.\nCriticism(s): The only shortcoming has to do with the limitations inherent in\nhuman language and thought itself: the impossibility of totally describing the\nineffable mystery of \"three in oneness.\"\n[At least in the 4th Cent, there were several different approaches, all\nof which fit the description here, and all regarded as orthodox, but which\nare somewhat different in detail.  Nicea was originally held to respond\nto Arius.  Arius can be thought of as carrying Origen's thought a bit\ntoo far, to the point of making the Son a separate entity.  In general\nthe East tended to take an approach based on Origen's, and it was hard\nto get acceptance of Nicea in the East.  Its final acceptance was\nbased on the work of Athanasius with the Cappadocians: Gregory of Nyssa and\nGregory of Nazianzus, among others.  While starting with three,\nthey show that their unity in nature and and action is such that one\nmust think of them as being a single God.  This allowed the Council\nof Constantinople, in 381, to get wide agreement on the idea of\nthree hypostatese and one ousia.  --clh]\n\nAdapted from _Charts of Christian Theology and Doctrine_, by H.

{"text":"Classify the following data: I've been a Giants season ticket holder for years and never really complained\nabout the old ballyard place. Sure, it's been cold, the food lines were long,\nand the hired hands were surly, but this was all part of the Giants mystique.\nOr so I thought.\n\nI went to Tuesday's game (3 - 1 Giants over the Marlins) and the 'Stick was \na much different place. Nothing short of a dome will eliminate the wind, but \neverything is a lot better. The lines are a lot shorter, the bathrooms are\nCLEAN and have running water, and the hired hands were very polite. \n\nThe new foghorn (lights up and blows after each homerun) and the wooden fence\nare very nice, as are the new bleachers. The bleachers start right at the top\nof the fence and give a great view, and they've got beer stands at the\nbottome of the bleachers. The only complaint is that the electronic \nold-fashioned scoreboard looks electronic - could be better.\n\nThese things should have been done a long time ago, but it took a real \nbusinessman (ex - Safeway President Peter Magowan) to figure it out. Just \nlike he used to tell his checkers, \"If the customers don't come back, I don't\nneed as many checkers\". This isn't a knock on Bob Lurie - he was a competent\nbusinessman but he didn't deal much with the general public.\n\nI'll give an example of how the level of service has changed. The onion \ndispenser jammed as I was using it. An attendant came over, apoligized for\nthe problem and proceeded to fix the machine. After he was done, he cleaned\nthe machine and said he was glad to be able to help. In the old days, there\nwas no attendant and the folks at the concession stands would say \"Go to\nthe stand 100 feet away - they might be able to help\".\n\nAll in all, it was a fun day\n\n","label":"rec.sport.baseball"}

Well, I BEG to differ....\n\nIMHO, Clark deserved to be a first star as much as Gilmour did. His\nfast breaks towards the net and the good opportunites that he\ncreated reminded me of the Clark of old. (But not to take any of the\ncredit away from Gilmour).\n\nI think the Leafs are playing GREAT hockey. WHY? \nWell first look at their injury list which includes, Cullen, Ellet,\nZezel, Macoun. Of course my question is this....how will the Leafs\nfare when they are once again \"healthy\" if they are playing this well\nso far??\n\nSecond, just look at their standings, still second in defence,\nmoved from 11th overall to 6th over in the last month, haven't lost\nat home in last 12 games, 8 game undefeated streak..etc.\n(BTW, am I wrong or was this Potvin's first shut-out? I can't \nremember him having any as of yet.)\n\nWell, as of April 3 we see that the race for first in the Norris\nhas truly begun and it will be a VERY CLOSE race between Chicago and\nToronto. And the best game of the season will probably be their last\nagainst each other.

I originally\nwrote the routines as a kind of exercise for myself, but perhaps someone\nhere will find them useful.  They are certainly useable as they are, but\nare missing some higher-level functionality.  They're intended more as an\nintro to mode 13h programming, a starting point.\n\n*** The library assumes a 386 processor, but it is trivial to modify it\n*** for a 286.

{"text":"Classify the following data: I received the following two notes from Martin Hellman with details\non how Clipper will work.  They are posted with his permission.  The\nimplications of some details are fascinating.\n\n-------\nDate: Sat, 17 Apr 93 23:05:23 PDT\nFrom: \"Martin Hellman\" <hellman@isl.stanford.edu>\nTo: (a long list of recipients)\nSubject: Clipper Chip\n\n\nMost of you have seen the announcement in Friday's NY Times,\netc. about NIST (National Institute of Standards & Technology)\nannouncing the \"Clipper Chip\" crypto device. Several messges\non the net have asked for more technical details, and some have\nbeen laboring under understandable misunderstandings given\nthe lack of details in the news  articles. So here to help out\nis your friendly NSA link: me. I was somewhat surprised Friday\nto get a call from the Agency which supplied many of the missing\ndetails. I was told the info was public, so here it is (the cc of this\nto Dennis Branstad at NIST is mostly as a double check on my\nfacts since I assume he is aware of all this; please let me know\nif I have anything wrong):\n\nThe Clipper Chip will have a secret crypto algorithm embedded in \nSilicon. Each chip will have two secret, 80-bit keys. One will be the \nsame for all chips (ie a system-wide key) and the other will be unit \nspecific. I don't know what NIST and NSA will call them, but I will \ncall them the system key SK and unit key UK in this message. \nThe IC will be designed to be extremely difficult to reverse so \nthat the system key can be kept secret. (Aside: It is clear that \nthey also want to keep the algorithm secret and, in my opinion, \nit may be as much for that as this stated purpose.) The unit key \nwill be generated as the XOR of two 80-bit random numbers K1 \nand K2 (UK=K1+K2) which will be kept by the two escrow \nauthorities. Who these escrow authorities will be is still to be \ndecided by the Attorney General, but it was stressed to me that \nthey will NOT be NSA or law enforcement agencies, that they \nmust be parties acceptable to the users of the system as unbiased. \nWhen a law enforcement agency gets a court order, they will \npresent it to these two escrow authorities and receive K1 and \nK2, thereby allowing access to the unit key UK.\n\nIn addition to the system key, each user will get to choose his \nor her own key and change it as often as desired. Call this key \nplain old K. When a message is to be sent it will first be \nencrypted under K, then K will be encrypted under the unit key UK, \nand the serial number of the unit added to produce a three part \nmessage which will then be encrypted under the system key SK \nproducing\n\n     E{ E[M; K], E[K; UK], serial number;  SK}\n\nWhen a court order obtains K1 and K2, and thence K, the law \nenforcement agency will use SK to decrypt all information \nflowing on the suspected link [Aside: It is my guess that \nthey may do this constantly on all links, with or without a \ncourt order, since it is almost impossible to tell which links \nover which a message will flow.] This gives the agency access to \n\n     E[M; K], E[K; UK], serial number\n\nin the above message. They then check the serial number \nof the unit and see if it is on the \"watch list\" for which they \nhave a court order. If so, they will decrypt E[K; UK] to obtain K, \nand then decrypt E[M; K] to obtain M.\n\nI am still in the process of assessing this scheme, so please do \nnot take the above as any kind of endorsement of the proposed \nscheme. All I am trying to do is help all of us assess the scheme \nmore knowledgably. But I will say that the need for just one court \norder worries me. I would feel more comfortable (though not \nnecessarily comfortable!) if two separate court orders were \nneeded, one per escrow authority. While no explanation is\nneeded, the following story adds some color: In researching\nsome ideas that Silvio Micali and I have been kicking around,\nI spoke with Gerald Gunther, the constitutional law expert\nhere at Stanford and he related the following story: When\nEdward Levi became Pres. Ford's attorney general (right\nafter Watergate), he was visited by an FBI agent asking\nfor \"the wiretap authorizations.\" When Levy asked for\nthe details so he could review the cases as required by\nlaw, the agent told him that his predecessors just turned\nover 40-50 blank, signed forms every time. Levi did not\ncomply and changed the system, but the lesson is clear: \nNo single person or authority should have the power to\nauthorize wiretaps (or worse yet, divulging of personal\nkeys). Sometimes he or she will be an Edward Levi\nand sometimes a John Mitchell.\n\nMartin Hellman\n\n----\n\nDate: Sun, 18 Apr 93 11:41:42 PDT\nFrom: \"Martin Hellman\" <hellman@isl.stanford.edu>\nTo: smb@research.att.com\nSubject: Re: Clipper Chip\n\nIt is fine to post my previous message to sci.crypt \nif you also post this message with it in which:\n\n1.

While the United States and 48 of the fifty states call their\n   highest court \"Supreme Court,\" \"Supreme Judicial Court\" or \"Supreme\n   Court of Appeals,\" Maryland and New York call theirs simply the\n   \"Court of Appeals.\"  To make matters worse, New York also calls its\n   _second-highest_ court the \"Supreme Court, Appellate Division\"...\n\nAtlantic Cement Co._, 26 N.Y.2d 219, 257 N.E.2d 870 (1970)):\n\nOscar H. Boomer, et al., owned land near the Atlantic Cement company's\nplant near Albany, N.Y.  (The fact pattern gives no information as to\nwhich came first, the plaintiff's acquisition of the land or he\ndefendant's start of production at their cement plant.)  In the course\nof its regular operations, the cement plant did injury to the\nplaintiffs' property via dirt, smoke and vibrations emanating from the\nplant.  The plaintiffs sought injunctive relief -- that is, they asked\nthe court to order Atlantic Cement to stop damaging their property.\n\n(Commentary: this seems entirely reasonable to me.  Boomer at al owned\ntheir property and, presumably, a right to quiet enjoyment of it.\nAtlantic Cement's actions were depriving Boomer et al of that right.)\n\nInstead of granting the plaintiffs' request for an injunction, the court\nordered them to accept the damage being done to their property, provided\nthat Atlantic Cement paid them $185,000 in compensatory damages.  In\nother words, the court granted Atlantic Cement Co., a private party, the\npower and authority to _take_ the plaintiffs rights to quiet enjoyment\nof their property by eminent domain.  A taking by eminent domain is\nalways problematical even when it's done by the state; allowing a\nprivate firm to do it is, in my opinion, totally wrong.\n\n(Yes, I know, the _Boomer_ court didn't call it eminent domain.  But if\nit walks like eminent domain and swims like eminent domain and quacks\nlike eminent domain...)\n\nLet me take issue with the way you've presented the case... you say that\n\"What happened in _Boomer_ was that the judge didn't allow the\nplaintiffs to blackmail the cement plant by demanding a multi-million\ndollar plant to be shut down over $185,000 in damages.\"  Blackmail?\n\n    (Pulls out Black's Law Dictionary, Abridged 5th Edition....\n    \"Blackmail: Unlawful demand of money or property under threat to\n    do bodily harm, to injure property, to accuse of crime, or to expose\n    disgraceful defects.  This crime is commonly included under\n    extortion statutes.\")\n\nHow do you define as \"blackmail\" one party's act of demanding the right\nto set its own sale price for a unique piece of property which it owns\nand which another party has expressed an interest in buying?  Or of\ndemanding the right not to sell that property at any price?  As I see\nit, Boomer et al, having found themselves in the fortunate position of\nowning something which Atlantic Cement had to purchase if it wanted to\nstay in business, had every right in the world to set whatever price\nthey wanted.  There isn't, or at least shouldn't be, any law that says\nthat you have to be a nice guy in your private business dealings.\n\nYou go on to say: \"The plant would never have been shut down -- the\nplaintiff's lawyers would have just negotiated a windfall settlement,\nbecause the plaintiffs would prefer an amount greater than $185K to\nhaving the plant shut down, while the plant would prefer any amount less\nthan the value of the plant to have the plant continue in operation.\"\n\nIf so, so what?  Since when are the courts supposed to be in the\nbusiness of preventing parties from reaping windfall settlements from\nother parties when those settlements arise from wrongful acts by those\nother parties?  If Atlantic Cement didn't want to have to face a choice\nbetween paying a windfall settlement or going out of business, well,\nshouldn't Atlantic Cement have thought of that before going _into_\nbusiness?  (I note that as far as the facts show Boomer et al were _not_\nthe parties responsible for bringing about this situation -- that was\nAtlantic Cement's own fault for choosing to build and operate the type\nof plant they did where and when they did.)\n\nAnd then you say: \"Everyone's property rights were protected; the\nplaintiffs were made whole; unnecessary settlement costs were avoided.\"\nAs above, I dispute your claim that the plaintiffs were \"made whole.\"\nThey were, in fact, by court action deprived of their rights as owners\nof property to choose to sell or not sell that property at a price\nacceptable to them.  And for that deprivation they were _not_ made\nwhole.  And again I ask: Since when are the courts supposed to be in the\nbusiness of ensuring that \"unnecessary\" settlement costs are avoided?\n(If so, I've been miseducated -- I always thought that the courts were\nsupposed to be in the business of ensuring that justice is done.)\n\n\n(1) _Boomer_ is not being taught as \"infamous,\" at least not at my\nschool.\n\n(Aside: Northeastern Law usually does a very good job of hiring for\ntheir first-year, mandatory classes (such as Torts, where I first\nencountered _Boomer_) instructors who, regardless of their personal\nopinions, can and do teach the law neutrally.  When the students get\ninto their second and third years, in which the students (a) can pick\nand choose which courses to take (except for the mandatory Professional\nResponsibility, of course) and (b) are presumed to be a bit more worldly\nand self-confident, less likely to be consciously or sub-consciously\nintimidated by Law School Professors and able to learn from openly\nbiased instructors rather than be indoctrinated by them, the instructors\ntend to be more open in expressing their own opinions.  This is\nespecially true of part-time instructors who, in real life, are\npracticing attorneys or sitting judges... this can be _very_\neducational, sometimes far more so than being taught by a somewhat\ncloistered scholar.  End of aside.)\n\nI called it infamous because that's my opinion of it.  For the reasons\nI've stated above, I believe it to be a triumph of something that I can\nonly call \"economic correctness\" over justice.\n\n(2) It is \"completely sensible\" only if you believe that the alleged\nright of the owners of Atlantic Cement to stay in business and avoid\nlosing a lot of their own money due to their own wrongful act, and\nthe alleged right of several hundred Atlantic Cement employees to\nnot have their jobs disappear, should trump the rights of people who\nown property which was damaged by Atlantic Cement's wrongful acts.\n(And if you believe that it is correct for the courts (or any other\nbranch of government) to grant to private parties the right to take\nother people's property by eminent domain.)\n\n\nReally?  I didn't know that... what, if anything, has he had to say\nabout cases like _Boomer_?\n\n\nI've admitted that my understanding of the field generally referred to\nas \"law and economics\" is weak.  If it advocates the use of economical\nanalysis as one of many \"tie-breaker\" factors which courts may use to\nhelp them reach decisions in cases in which the dispute, as measured by\nthe scale of \"justice\", is evenly balanced, fine.  But as illustrated by\n_Boomer_, it is _not_ fine when the courts start viewing the economics\nof a case as being more important than the justice of a case.","label":"talk.politics.misc"}

{"text":"Classify the following data: Vera Shanti Noyes writes;\n\n\nOf course I believe in Predestination.  It's a very biblical doctrine as\nRomans 8.28-30 shows (among other passages).  Furthermore, the Church\nhas always taught predestination, from the very beginning.  But to say\nthat I believe in Predestination does not mean I do not believe in free\nwill.  Men freely choose the course of their life, which is also\naffected by the grace of God.  However, unlike the Calvinists and\nJansenists, I hold that grace is resistable, otherwise you end up with\nthe idiocy of denying the universal saving will of God (1 Timothy 2.4). \nFor God must give enough grace to all to be saved.  But only the elect,\nwho he foreknew, are predestined and receive the grace of final\nperserverance, which guarantees heaven.  This does not mean that those\nwithout that grace can't be saved, it just means that god foreknew their\nobstinacy and chose not to give it to them, knowing they would not need\nit, as they had freely chosen hell.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  ^^^^^^^^^^^\nPeople who are saved are saved by the grace of God, and not by their own\neffort, for it was God who disposed them to Himself, and predestined\nthem to become saints.  But those who perish in everlasting fire perish\nbecause they hardened their heart and chose to perish.  Thus, they were\ndeserving of God;s punishment, as they had rejected their Creator, and\nsinned against the working of the Holy Spirit.\n\n\nWell, I would hold that as God most certainly gives everybody some\nblessing for what good they have done (even if it was only a little),\nfor those He can't bless in the next life, He blesses in this one.  And\nthose He will not punish in the next life, will be chastised in this one\nor in Purgatory for their sins.  Every sin incurs some temporal\npunishment, thus, God will punish it unless satisfaction is made for it\n(cf. 2 Samuel 12.13-14, David's sin of Adultery and Murder were\nforgiven, but he was still punished with the death of his child.)  And I\nneed not point out the idea of punishment because of God's judgement is\nquite prevelant in the Bible.  Sodom and Gommorrah, Moses barred from\nthe Holy Land, the slaughter of the Cannanites, Annias and Saphira,\nJerusalem in 70 AD, etc.\n\nnot a >good parallel, but i'm going to go with it anyway), why should we\nnot >stop the murder and violation of people who may (or may not) be more\n\nWe should stop the slaughter of the innocent (cf Proverbs 24.11-12), but\ndoes that mean that Christians should support a war in Bosnia with the\nU.S. or even the U.N. involved?  I do not think so, but I am an\nisolationist, and disagree with foreign adventures in general.  But in\nthe case of Bosnia, I frankly see no excuse for us getting militarily\ninvolved, it would not be a \"just war.\"  \"Blessed\" after all, \"are the\npeacemakers\" was what Our Lord said, not the interventionists.  Our\nactions in Bosnia must be for peace, and not for a war which is\nunrelated to anything to justify it for us.","label":"soc.religion.christian"}

{"text":"Classify the following data: Excerpts from the Clipper announcement, with some questions:\n\n\n\nIn these two sections the phrases `or other legal order' and `normally a\ncourt order' imply there is some other way or ways of doing a legal\nwiretap. What is/are these? How do they affect the way people who trust the\nsystem of court orders to protect them feel about this escrow system?\n\nThe second section shows the sequence of events.\nThe law enforcer, armed with his warrant, attaches his headphones to the\nline with his croc-clips (remember, these are the folk who couldn't cope\nwith digital telephony) and hears a load of modem-like tones (we are\ntalking analogue telephony here).\nWhat next? What modulation scheme do these Clipper boxes use?\nIs it possible to record the tones for use after the keys are obtained?\nI thought it was quite difficult to record a modem session at some\nintermediate point on the line. Maybe they have taken a crash course\nin data comms and have a unit that demodulates the tones and stores the\ndigital stream for decryption later. This would still suffer from the\nsame problems as trying to record the tones as the demodulator would not\nbe at one end of the line. If calls can't be recorded for decryption later\nit would be quite easy to foil the system by buying lots of Clipper units\n(these are supposed to be cheap mass market items) and using them in turn.\n\nHow tolerant is the modulation scheme to errors? These things are proposed\nfor use by US corporations to secure their foreign offices, where phone\nline quality may well be poor. It seems hard enough to me to get digitised\nspeech of any quality into something a modem can handle without having to\nadd lots of error correction to keep the decryption in sync.\n\n\nThis raises an intersting question in the UK. Here it is illegal to connect\nanything to a public telecomms network without it being approved by a body\ncalled BABT. It has been stated, either here or in the uk.telecom group,\nthat they will not approve equipment that does encryption. I don't know\nif this is true or not, but this would make a good test case.\nPerhaps `friendly' countries, and the UK may still qualify, will get\nto fish in the escrowed key pool as well.\n","label":"sci.crypt"}

They believe they're going to _die_. Understand\nthat you've turned Hell into a verb. Using the same logic, it also follows\nthat all animals are 'going to Hell.' Are you sure this is what you want\nto say? (presumably animals don't have the opportunity to get to heaven,\nbut this still doesn't change the fact that they're going to Hell (die\na final death))\n\n   I don't claim to know whether or not there is an afterlife of _some_\nsort, but if Hell is as you described (final death, and\nnot eternal perpetuation of consciousness) it will be true that\nthere will never be a moment when I am aware of my non-existence. \n(assuming I 'go to Hell' and not to Heaven) In other words, I'll\nnever know I'm dead. Hmmm... \n\n\n\n    Ever hear people say of a loved one who was ill, and has died:\n \"At least she's not suffering any more; She's in Heaven now.\" ?\n\n    Consider the following statement:\n \"At least she's not suffering any more; She's in Hell now.\"\n\n    The above statement sounds odd, but according to your definition of Hell, \nit would be a true statement. The person in Hell would not be suffering. \nGranted, they wouldn't be *anything* (wouldn't be having any\nconscious experience whatsoever). \n\n    You say Hell (death) is eternal. However, this loses its meaning \nto a dead person. And to me, it seems that the threat of some sort \nof eternal punishment only makes sense/has force if one expects to\nbe conscious throughout this eternity. \n\n    Many atheists believe that the thirst for an afterlife is simply the\nproduct of propaganda (\"Friend, do you want the FREE gift of e-ternal life?\"\nIt's my understanding that the early jews did not believe in an afterlife.\nCan anyone back me up on this?) combined with the survival instinct all\nanimals share. The difference is we have consciousness, and once we get the\nidea of eternal life drilled into our brains, we then desire a sort of\nsuper-survival. \n\n \n\n    That would depend on what Heaven is like. If God is a King, and \nan eternity in heaven consists of giving thanks and praise to the King,\nI might opt for Hell. I read a lovely account of a missionary trying to\nconvert Eskimos to Christianity in the book _The Illusion of Immortality_\nby Corliss Lamont. The missionary started to speak about Heaven. \n\"Are there seals in heaven? Will we be able to go hunting?\" asked an\nEskimo. The missionary said no. The group of Eskimos then said something\nto the effect of, \"Well what good is your Heaven if there's no hunting?\nScram.\" I highly recommend the above book (IOI) to anyone who wants an\naccount of the other side of the immortality coin (that there is no \nimmortality). \n\n\n\n\n   Pax,","label":"soc.religion.christian"}

By 1926, many of the obsolete WWI aircraft had been retired\nand Whirlwind had their power/weight ratio and reliability up to the point\nwhere long-distance flights became practical.

{"text":"Classify the following data: Subject: Re: Eugenics\n/\n;Probably within 50 years, a new type of eugenics will be possible. \n;Maybe even sooner.  We are now mapping the human genome.  We will \n;then start to work on manipulation of that genome.  Using genetic\n;engineering, we will be able to insert whatever genes we want.\n;No breeding, no \"hybrids\", etc.  The ethical question is, should\n;we?\n \nTwo past problems with eugenics have been \n1) reducing the gene pool and \n2) defining the status of the eugenized.\n \nInserting genes would not seem to reduce the gene pool unless the inserted\ngenes later became transmissible to progeny. Then they may be able to\ncrowd out \"garbage genes.\" This may in the future become possible. Even if\nit does, awareness of the need to maintain the gene pool would hopefully\nmean provisions will be made for saving genes that may come in handy\nlater. Evidently the genes for sickle cell disease in equatorial Africa\nand for diabetes in the Hopi *promoted* survival in some conditions. We\ndon't really know what the future may hold for our environment. The\nreduced wilderness- and disease-survival capacity of our relatively inbred\ndomesticated animals comes to mind. Vulcanism, nuclear winter, ice age,\nmeteor impact, new microbiological threats, famine, global warming, etc.,\netc., are all conceivable. Therefore, having as many genes as possible\navailable is a good strategy for species survival. \n \nOf course, the status of genetically altered individuals would start out\nas no different than anyone else's. But if we could make\n\"philosopher-kings\" with great bodies and long lives, would we (or they)\nwant to give them elevated status? We could. The Romans did it with their\nkings *without* the benefits of such eugenics. The race eventually\nrealized and dealt with the problems which that caused, but for a while,\nit was a problem. Orwell introduced us to the notion of what might happen\nto persons genetically altered for more menial tasks. But there is nothing\nnew under the sun. We treated slaves the same way for millennia before\n\"1984.\"   \n \nI see no inherent problem with gene therapy which avoids at least these 2\nproblems. Humans have always had trouble having the virtue and wisdom to\nuse any power that falls into their hands to good ends all the time. That\nhasn't stopped the race as a whole yet. Many are the civilizations which\nhave died from inability to adapt to environmental change. However, also\nmany are the civilizations which have died from the abuse of their own\npower. The ones which survived have hopefully learned a lesson from the\nfates of others, and have survived by making better choices when their\nturns came.\n \nNot that I don't think that this gene altering power couldn't wipe us off\nthe face of the earth or cause endless suffering. Nuclear power or global\nwarming or whatever could and may still do that, too. \n \nThe real issue is an issue of wisdom and virtue. I personally don't think\nman has enough wisdom and virtue to pull this next challenge off any\nbetter than he did the for last few. We, as eugenists, may make it, an we\nmay not. If we don't, I hope there are reservoirs of \"garbage\" people out\nin some backwater with otherwise long discarded \"garbage\" genes which will\npull us through. \n \nI believe that the real problem is and will probably always be the same.\nMan needs to accept input from the great spirit of God to overcome his\nlacks in the area of knowing how to use the power he has. Some men have,\nand I believe all men may, listen to and obey the still small voice of God\nin their hearts. This is the way to begin to recieve the wisdom and virtue\nneeded to escape the problems consequent to poor choices. Peoples have\ndied out for many reasons. The societies which failed to accept enough\ninput from God to safely use the power they had developed have destroyed\nthemselves, and often others in the process. It is self-evident that the\nones which survive today have either accepted enough input from the Spirit\nto use their powers wisely enough to avoid or survive their own mistakes\nthus far, or else haven't had enough power for long enough. \n \nIn summary, I would say that the question of whether to use this new\ntechnology is really an ancient one. And the answer, in some ways hard, in\nsome ways easy, is the same ancient answer. It isn't the power, it is the\nSpirit.\n \nSorry for the long post. Got carried away.","label":"sci.med"}

Both courses, Intensive Elementary Japanese and \nIntensive Intermediate Japanese, are ten week, ten credit courses \neach equivalent to one full year of Japanese language study.  They begin \nJune 7 and end August 13.  The courses meet five days per week, five hours \nper day.  There is a flat rate tuition charge of $1600 per course.  \nFellowships available for science and engineering students.  Contact \nSteven Brener, Program Manager of the Japanese Science and Technology\nManagement Program, at the University of Pittsburgh at the number or\naddress below.  \nALL INTERESTED INDIVIDUALS ARE ENCOURAGED TO APPLY, THIS IS NOT LIMITED TO \nUNIVERSITY STUDENTS.\n\n\n\n  \n\n#######################################################################\n#################   New Program Announcement   ########################\n#######################################################################\n\n\n            JAPANESE SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY MANAGEMENT PROGRAM\n\nThe Japanese Science and Technology Management Program (JSTMP) is a new\nprogram jointly developed by the University of Pittsbugh and Carnegie Mellon \nUniversity.  Students and professionals in the engineering and scientific \ncommunitites are encouraged to apply for classes commencing in June 1993 and \nJanuary 1994.\n\n\nPROGRAM OBJECTIVES\nThe program intends to promote technology transfer between Japan and the \nUnited States.  It is also designed to let scientists, engineers, and managers\nexperience how the Japanese proceed with technological development.  This is \nfacilitated by extended internships in Japanese research facilities and\nlaboratories that provide participants with the opportunity to develop\nlong-term professional relationships with their Japanese counterparts.\n\n\nPROGRAM DESIGN\nTo fulfill the objectives of the program, participants will be required to \ndevelop advanced language capability and a deep understanding of Japan and\nits culture.  Correspondingly, JSTMP consists of three major components:\n\n1. TRAINING IN THE JAPANESE LANGUAGE\nSeveral Japanese language courses will be offered, including intensive courses\ndesigned to expedite language preparation for scientists and engineers in a\nrelatively short time.\n\n2. EDUCATION IN JAPANESE BUSINESS AND SOCIAL CULTURE\nA particular enphasis is placed on attaining a deep understanding of the\ncultural and educational basis of Japanese management approaches in \nmanufacturing and information technology.  Courses will be available in a \nvariety of departments throughout both universities including Anthropology,\nSociology, History, and Political Science.  Moreover, seminars and colloquiums\nwill be conducted.  Further, a field trip to Japanese manufacturing or \nresearch facilities in the United States will be scheduled.\n\n\n3. AN INTERNSHIP OR A STUDY MISSION IN JAPAN\nUpon completion of their language and cultural training at PITT and CMU, \nparticipants will have the opportunity to go to Japan and observe,\nand participate in the management of technology.  Internships in Japan\nwill generally run for one year; however, shorter ones are possible.\n\n\nFELLOWSHIPS COVERING TUITION FOR LANGUAGE AND CULTURE COURSES, AS WELL AS\nSTIPENDS FOR LIVING EXPENSES ARE AVAILABLE.\n\n        FOR MORE INFORMATION AND APPLICATION MATERIALS CONTACT\n\nSTEVEN BRENER\t\t\t\tSUSIE BROWN\nJSTMP\t\t\t\t\tCarnegie Mellon University, GSIA\nUniversity of Pittsburgh\t\tPittsburgh, PA 15213-3890\n4E25 Forbes Quadrangle\t\t\tTelephone: (412) 268-7806\nPittsburgh, PA 15260\t\t\tFAX:\t   (412) 268-8163\nTelephone: (412) 648-7414\t\t\nFAX:       (412) 648-2199\t\t\n\n############################################################################\n############################################################################ \n\n\nInterested individuals, companies and institutions should respond by phone or\nmail.

{"text":"Classify the following data: \nFor the purpose of a contest, I'd bet some things could be cut.  Like fuel\nfor re-entry, any kind of heat shielding, etc., etc.  Even still, if the\ncontest participants had to fund DC-1 development, it probably wouldn't be\nworth it to develop DC-1 (just for the contest).  Just give me the cheapest\nheaviest lift man rated (or at least under 6 or so Gs) booster...  If I\ndon't have to pay for DC-1 development, great!, I'll use it.\n\nBut back to the contest goals, there was a recent article in AW&ST about a\nlow cost (it's all relative...) manned return to the moon.  A General\nDynamics scheme involving a Titan IV & Shuttle to lift a Centaur upper\nstage, LEV, and crew capsule.  The mission consists of delivering two\nunmanned payloads to the lunar surface, followed by a manned mission. \nTotal cost:  US was $10-$13 billion.  Joint ESA(?)/NASA project was $6-$9\nbillion for the US share.\n\nI didn't find a mention of how long the crew could stay, but I'd bet that\nits  around 30 days.  And the total payload delivered was about 30 metric\ntonnes.  So if you ignore the scientific payload, hitch a ride in the crew\nhabitation module (no return trip...), and toss in a few more tonnes for\nthe additional consumables to last another 11 months, then you *might* be\nable to get a year visit out of 15 tonnes (and in case its not obvious,\nthat's a wild ass guess).  A pretty boring visit, since every trip outdoors\neats up a bit of LOX.  And I'm not certain if a home brewed (or\ncollege-brewed) life support system could last a year.  But let's round\nthis up to 19.4 tonnes (convient, since the GD plan talks about 9.7 ton\npayloads delivered to the lunar surface.  This adds up to two Centaurs, two\nLEVs, two Shuttle flights... All to put a single man on the moon for a\nyear.   Hmmm.  Not really practical.  Anyone got a cheaper/better way of\ndelivering 15-20 tonnes to the lunar surface within the decade?  Anyone\nhave a more precise guess about how much a year's supply of consumables and\nequipment would weigh?\n\nAnd I was wondering about the GD LEV.  Is it reusable?  Or is it discarded\nto burn up on return to LEO?  If its not discarded, could it be refueled? \nHenry: Do you know anything about the GD LEV?  I noted that it uses RL-10\nengines.  Aren't they reusable/restartable?  Would a LEV fit in a DC-1? \nI've forgotten (if I ever knew) what the cargo bay dimensions are for the\nDC-1.\n\nAll in all, I'm not certain that the single goal/prize of staying on the\nmoon for a year is wise and/or useful.  How about:  A prize for the first\nnon-government sponsered unmanned moon landing, then another for a manned\nmoon landing, then yet another for a system to extract consumables from\nlunar soil, another for a reusable earth/moon shuttle, and so forth.  Find\nsome way to build civilian moonbase infrastructure...  Having a single goal\nmight result in a bunch of contestents giving up after one person appeared\nto win.  And for those that didn't give up, I find something a little scary\nabout a half dozen people huddling in rickety little moon shelters.  I'd\nlike to see as much a reward for co-operation as for competition.\n\nLastly, about ten or fifteen years back I seem to recall that there was an\nEnglish space magazine that had an on-going discussion about moonbases on\nthe cheap.  I recalled it discussed things like how much heat the human\nbody produced, how much lunar material it'd need for protection from solar\nflares, etc.  Unfortunately I don't remember the name of this magazine. \nDoes this ring a bell to anyone?","label":"sci.space"}

{"text":"Classify the following data: April 13, 1993 response by Al Moore (L629159@LMSC5.IS.LMSC.LOCKHEED.COM):\n\nBasically the problem is that Israel may remain, or leave, the occupied \nterritories; it cannot do both, it cannot do neither. So far, Israe \ncontinues to propose that they remain. The Palestinians propose that they \nleave. Why should either change their view? It is worth pointing out that \nthe only area of compromise accomodating both views seems to require a\nreduction in the Israeli presence. Israel proposes no such reduction....\nand in fact may be said to *not* be negotiating.\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTim: \n\nThere seem to be two perceptions that **have to be addressed**. The\nfirst is that of Israel, where there is little trust for Arab groups, so\nthere is little support for Israel giving up **tangible** assets in \nexchange for pieces of paper, \"expectations\", \"hopes\", etc. The second\nis that of the Arab world/Palestinians, where there is the demand that\nthese \"tangible concessions\" be made by Israel **without** it receiving\nanything **tangible** back.  Given this, the gap between the two stances\nseems to be the need by Israel of receiving some ***tangible*** returns\nfor its expected concessions. By \"tangible\" is meant something that\n1) provides Israel with \"comparable\" protection (from the land it is to \ngive up), 2) in some way ensures that the Arab states and Palestine \n**will be** accountable and held actively (not just \"diplomatically) \nresponsible for the upholding of all actions on its territory (by citizens \nor \"visitors\").\n\nIn essence I do not believe that Israel objections to Palestinian\nstatehood would be anywhere near as strong as they are now IF Israel\nwas assured that any new Palestinian state *would be committed to** \nco-existing with Israel and held responsible for ALL attacks on Israel \nfrom its territory.\n\tAside from some of the rather slanted proposals above,\n\thow *could* such \"guarantees\" be instilled? For example,\n\thow could such \"guarantees\"/\"controls\" be added to the\n\tPalestinian PISGA proposals?\n\nIsrael is hanging on largely because it is scared stiff that the minute\nit lets go (gives lands back to Arab states, no more \"buffer zone\", gives\nfull autonomy to Palestinians), ANY and/or ALL of the Arab parties\ncould (and *would*, if not \"controlled\" somehow) EASILY return to the \ntraditional anti-Israel position. The question then is HOW to *really*\nensure that that will not happen.","label":"talk.politics.mideast"}

As far as\n  I can tell, you're proposing the following rules of engagement\n  between Israel and the Palestinean resistance.  Please feel\n  revise this preliminary draft as necessary:\n\n  1) Israeli military personnel are fair game at any time, in uniform\n     or out, on duty or off.  In practice, since any male or female\n     Israeli of military age (18-?) may be off-duty military, all but\n     young children are acceptable targets.  Since the existence of\n     Israel constitutes indication of hostile intent, no further\n     provocation is required.\n\n  2) To avoid inpermissable violations of the rights of non-combatant\n     Palestineans, Israeli forces must not engage Palestineans\n     without positive identification as military personnel, clear\n     indication of aggressive intent, and a clear field of fire.\n\n    a) Positive identification may be assured by either checking for\n       Palestinean military uniform, by posession of exclusively\n       military armament (ie, T78 MBTs or MiG-29 aircraft), or\n       self-identification (either verbal or documentary).  Note\n       that dual-use military/civilian weaponry such as hand grenades,\n       AK-47 rifles, and RPG launchers do not constitute positive\n       military identification and require closer inspection such\n       as document checks.\n\n    b) Aggressive intent (as distinct from merely 'hostile' intent,\n       which is the normal condition) may be assured by not less\n       than three rounds of incoming fire separated by intervals\n       of not less than ten seconds between rounds.  Note that a\n       single burst of automatic-weapon fire counds as one round,\n       as does a volley of rocket fire from more than one source.\n       As noted above, dual-use weaponry may NOT be assumed to\n       originate from military personnel, and thus do not justify\n       armed response.\n\n    c) A clear field of fire can be guaranteed by making a positive\n       military identification of all personnel in the target area of\n       the weapons to be used.  Note that aggressive intent need not\n       be proven for all possible targets.  Thus, if IAF aircraft\n       are attacked by a SAM crew it is not necessary to check the\n       papers of each crew member so long as none are obviously\n       civilians (as indicated, for instance, by the posession of\n       uniquely civilian weaponry such as stones, axes, and Molotov\n       coctails.)  Since it is often difficult for IAF elements to\n       land and make the necessary checks, ground forces should\n       first screen prospective strike areas before AGM fire.\n       For ACM purposes, a cockpit-to-cockpit pass within 5 meters\n       is usually sufficient for this purpose, but may be repeated\n       if necessary.","label":"talk.politics.mideast"}

An on-the-road rally where participants are given a set of\n      directions and clues guiding participates around the \n      Joliet/Plainfield area.  The object is to navigate a course\n      based on a set of directions and clues.  Participants will\n      be given a set of questions pertaining to the course which\n      they must answer along the way.  Points are awarded for the\n      number of correct answers given.  Directions will ultimately \n      lead to an off-road area where a four-wheel drive course is \n      set-up.  At various locations in the on-road course, check-points\n      will be set-up where participants will be asked other questions\n      or requested to perform some activity (e.g. tire roll, truck tow,\n      basketball free-throw, etc.) for additional points.\n\n   2. An optional off-road, four wheel drive course where participants\n      will navigate off-road trails, mud bogs and/or hill climbs.\n      Points are awarded for successfully navigating off-road obstacles\n      without getting stuck.  If you should get stuck (which is half\n      the fun anyway), there will be assistance to get your vehicle\n      unstuck so you can try it again.  The off-road course will\n      divided up based on tire size, so stock 4x4s as well as modified\n      4x4s can run the course.\n     \n  At the end of the rally, trophies will be awarded to top scoring\n  participants.  Door prizes and dash plaques will also be given out.\n  Food and drinks also available at the conclusion.\n\n* This is an organized activity sponsored by the Joliet Mud Turtles\n  so safety and fun is our foremost concern.  All 4x4s must be\n  street legal and have solid tow points for the off-road section\n  of the course - we don't want to have to separate someone's bumper\n  from their vehicle :) .\n\nThe Particulars:\n\n* Rally begins at Instant Replay, 2409 Plainfield Road, Joliet Il.\n    (815)436-9382   (see map below)\n* Registration is between 9 and 10:30 a.m.  First truck out at 10:00 a.m.\n* Rally date is Sunday April 25th, rain or shine\n* There is an entry fee of $10 per truck.\n* You must have a co-driver (passengers allowed)\n* A valid drivers license is required\n* Suggested equipment:\n      CB Radio\n      Compass\n      Tow Strap and Clevis\n      Clip Board and Pencil\n* No alcohol during rally\n* For more information contact\n   Gary (815)727-3415\n   Tom  (815)485-9346\n   Norm Jr. (815)741-4853\n   Brian (708)979-6083\n\n\n                                            __\n              Instant                      /\\\n      |       Replay |             |         \\\n      | 1.9mi  ___   | 1.2 mi      |        North\n      |<----->|   | <------------> |\n Rt30 |       |___|  |             |\n------|---------------------------------------------\n Exit |              |             |         ^\n 257  |              |             |         |\n      |              |             |         |\n      |Rt55          |Canton       |Larkin   |\n      |              |Farm         |Ave      |\n      |              |Rd.          |         | 3 mi.\n      |              |             |         |\n      |              |             |         |\n      |                            |         |\n      |                            |         |\n      |       Rt80                 |         v","label":"rec.autos"}

I can't\n: see it having trouble keeping up.  His pcplus for dos works great,\n\nre: What to do after the high speed modem arrives.       Edition 01 Apr 93\n\nThis article applies only to Windows 3.0 and 3.1, and not to NT, OS/2\nor DOS apps not running under Windows.\n\nOne of the unadvertised limitations of most current Windows PCs is that\ntheir RS-232C (serial, COM) performance is seriously deficient.  Almost\neveryone who purchases a high-speed modem (V.32bis, V.32, PEP or HST)\ndiscovers the problem the first time they try to download a file or accept\nan incoming FAX (at 9600+) after upgrading the modem.  Overrun and retry\nerrors abound, even when the only active application is the datacomm or\nFAX program.  If the transfer completes at all, it may take even longer\nthan with the old 2400bps modem.\n\n\nThere are three reasons for the problem:\n\n1. The Universal Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitters (UARTs) used in most\n   PCs are primitive Ns8250 devices with single-byte FIFO buffers.  If the\n   operating system/driver cannot read and flush each character at high\n   interrupt rates, the next incoming character overwrites the FIFO and\n   the previous one is lost.  DOS, being a fairly single-minded\n   environment during datacomm, can usually keep up. Windows can't.\n\n2. Windows has more operating system overhead than plain DOS, and\n   interrupts often take longer to service.  Overruns are much more likely\n   than under DOS.  As soon as you report to your PC/modem vendor that you\n   are losing data, you may be advised that \"you need to upgrade to a\n   16550\". More likely, since there seems to be a conspiracy of ignorance\n   about this issue,  you'll get no useful advice at all.  Most of the\n   store-front and mail-order sources I spoke with in attempting to solve\n   my own problem had never heard the term \"16550\" and many didn't even\n   know what a UART was.\n\n3. Even your PC has Ns16550A UARTs (and PS/2's do), or if you can upgrade\n   your mother/COM board or add a new COM board, you may STILL experience\n   errors and overruns because the standard MicroSoft Windows COM drivers\n   don't take full advantage of the 16550.  Windows 3.1 is improved in this\n   regard over 3.0, but I still recommend a driver upgrade.  Applications\n   like ProComm+/Win (which is what I use) cannot get around this problem\n   by themselves.\n\nIf you have a modem CARD, you may not have a problem, as the modem part of\nthe card can be designed to be aware of the state of the UART, and avoid\noverrunning it; however, I wouldn't want to bet that the card designers\nwere that clever, and will insist on a 16550 UART if I ever buy a modem\ncard.  Some modem cards don't even have conventional UARTs, but if they\nare to work with standard Windows drivers, they need to simulate one.\nUse MSD.EXE (below) to see what the modem card is, or is pretending to be.\n\n\nThe Hardware Situation.\n\nThe UARTs on most PC COM ports are based on National Semiconductor Ns8250\nor Ns16450 chips (or megacells inside VLSI chips where you can't replace\nthem).  You can ID the UART type on your system by running the MicroSoft\ndiagnostic program \\WINDOWS\\MSD.EXE.  Be sure to run it in DOS *before*\nbringing up Windows.   The Windows serial API may prevent MSD from\naccurately identifying a 16550 if you run it from a Windows DOS prompt.\n\nThe Ns16550 UART has separate 16-byte transmit and receive FIFOs with\nconfigurable trigger levels, and can run reliably at clock rates up to\n460,800 bps, although with current modem technology, there's no point in\npushing your luck by going over 115,200 bps. The 16550 has shorted access\ncycle times than the 16450 or 8250.  The 16550 also has DMA capability, but\nit is not clear that any PC drivers ever use this.  For more technical info,\nsee National Semiconductor Application Note AN-491.\n\nSo, what UART component do you have?\n\nTry to locate the UART on your mother board, multi-function I/O card, COM\nboard or ISA/MCA modem card.  If you can't find a socketed component with\nthe numbers \"8250\" or \"16450\", your COM ports are probably buried in VLSI,\nand you won't be able to perform a chip replacement.  If you can DISABLE\nyour VLSI COM ports (as I chose to do), you can at least add an aftermarket\nCOM board.\n\nIf you have one or more socketed 8250 or 16450 chips, you can buy plug-in\nNs16550AFN or PC16C550CN (low power CMOS version) ICs from several\nsuppliers typically for $9 to $15 each.  The \"N\" chip is the normal 40-pin\ndual-in-line package.  Other styles are available, but avoid any Ns16550\nchips without the \"A\" (the 16C550C are presumably all OK).\n\nEarly Ns chips have bugs, although National will reportedly exchange those\nof their own manufacture for free.  Clone chips are available from various\nIC makers other than National.  The manual for the TurboCom drivers states\nsupport for the following (apparently equivalent) chips:\nNational Semiconductor: 16550A, 16551, 16552\nChips&Technology:       82C607\nTexas Instruments:      t16c550a\nSilicon Systems:        73M550\nVLSI                    16C550\nTurboCom warns about the pre-\"A\" Ns16550 and Western Digital 16C550,\nsays that problems have been reported with early IBM PS/2 55SX and 70\nsystems (IBM reportedly will upgrade them).\n\nIf you DON'T have socketed 8250/16450 chips, you'll need to buy an after-\nmarket COM or multi-function board. If this is a modem card situation, you\nmay be hosed. To add a new COM or multi-function card, you'll need to\neither disable the COM1/2 port(s) you are replacing, or re-assign them to\nCOM3/4 (although watch out for IRQ conflicts without TurboCom).\n\nAlthough cheaper cards are available, in the interest of getting the\nproblem solved quickly I elected buy the Modular Circuit Technology\nMCT-AIO+ card from:\n\nJDR Microdevices\n2233 Samaritan Drive\nSan Jose  CA  95124\n(800) 538-5000 voice US\n(408) 559-1200 voice other\n(800) 538-5005 FAX US\n\nThe MCT-AIO+ (and the \"+\" is important) sells for $89.95.  It is an 8-bit\nISA card providing:\n\nPort Type  Connector  Address and IRQ        Comments\nCOM        DB9M       COM 1,2,3 IRQ 2,3,4,5  Ns16550AFN in socket\nCOM        ribbon     COM 2,3,4 IRQ 2,3,4,5  Ns16550AFN in socket\nParallel   DB25F      LPT1,2,3  IRQ 5,7\nGame       ribbon\n\nThe kit includes a ribbon cable and DB25F connector for the secondary COM\nport, a ribbon cable/connector for the game port, two bulkhead plates for\nthe ribbon-based connectors and a 9F-to-25F adaptor cable.  Each port can\nbe individually disabled, and the COM ports have TX, RX, RTS, CTS, DTR,\nDCD, and DSR jumpers.\n\nJDR also sells a Super-I/O m-f card that also has IDE.\n\nI have heard from several people about less expensive m-f I/O cards\nwith 16550s:\n\nTSD Systems\n(407) 331-9130\n$19.95 for the card, plus $9.95 per 16550.\n\nGreenfield Trading and Distributors\n(518) 271-2473 (voice), (518) 271-7811(FAX).\nTheir card is $33 w/one 16550, $45 w/2, and they sell 16550AFNs for $13.\n\nR&S DATA SYSTEMS, INC.\n820 East Highway 434\nLongwood, FL  32750\nPHONE: (407) 331-1424\nFAX: (407) 331-8606\n2COM/LPT/Game card w/2 16550s for $39\n\nI have no personal experience with any of the firms except JDR.\n\nMeanwhile, back at the MCT card from JDR... I only needed two serial ports,\nand am running out of IRQs on my PC, so I disabled my built-in VLSI-based\n8250 ports. However, with the TurboCom driver (below), I could have set\nthe internals as COM3 and 4, using IRQ sharing.\n\n\nThe Software Situation\n\nSimply upgrading to 16550 UARTs will not completely solve common overrun\nproblems.  The standard MS serial drivers don't take full advantage of the\n16550. The Windows 3.0 drivers are even less capable, and the Windows 3.1\ndrivers have the following limitations:\n - They enable only the receive FIFO, and only at rates above 2400 bps.\n - They never enable the transmit FIFO, which  results in an interrupt\n   rate of 10x during uploads.\n - They set the trigger level at 14 bytes (too high - it's easy for 2\n   more bytes to arrive before the driver can read the FIFO).\n - The Ports menu of the Control Panel only allows speeds up to 19200.\n   With a V.32bis modem,  sparse data and text can easily compress 3:1\n   or more, suggesting that a host DTE connect rate of 57,600 bps would\n   be effective.\n - The API won't accept rates above \"CBR_128000\".\n - The API won't let DOS programs know there is a 16550 there, and even\n   if it did, DOS programs that aren't 16550-aware get little benefit\n   from a 16550 port with the standard drivers.\n - They don't allow IRQ sharing for COM3,4.\n - The BIOS doesn't initialize COM3,4 properly in many systems.\n - Windows provides no workaround for apps that don't provide port\n   speed options above 19200 bps.\n\nThese problems are reportedly NOT solved in Windows NT or DOS 6.0, and may\nor may not be addressed in any Windows releases after 3.1 (but before 4.0).\nRumors suggest they \"may\" be solved in Windows \"4.0\".\n\nYou can get replacement drivers that solve all of those problems by buying\na copy of \"TurboCom\", current version 1.2, from:\n\nBio-Engineering Research\nPacific CommWare Division\n180 Beacon Hill Lane\nAshland  OR   97520-9701\n(503) 482-2744 voice\n(503) 482-2627 FAX\n(503) 482-2633 BBS\nMCImail:    344-5374\nCompuServe: 71521,760\n\nPrice was around $50 as I recall.  Bio-Eng is not set up to accept credit\ncards, so I had to send a check.  Egghead and 1-800-Software list TurboCom\nbut as far as I know, they don't stock it.  Bio is not a software company\nper se.  They apparently needed reliable hi-speed serial connections for\nan in-house instrument application, wrote their own driver, discovered a\nmarket for it, revised it to be a general purpose COM driver suite. They\nrecently upgraded it for Windows 3.1.  It is run-time licensed.\n\nI now have my host (DTE) connect rate set to 57,600 bps most of  my\ndatacomm apps, and I am having ZERO problems with downloads. I routinely\nsee transfer rates that exceed 2,000 bps. I am also using 115,200 bps\nwhen linking an HP95LX to my PC, with lossless bi-directional I/O.\nUploads to various remote systems are another matter, because many hosts\nare still using antique UARTs and drivers.\n\nNote that 19200 is still the highest rate that the Windows 3.1 Port menu\nin Control Panel will allow in configuring a COM port.  TurboCom gets\naround this by allowing you to specify, on each port, a factor that will\nset the real UART rate to a multiple of the rate passed through the\nWindows APIs and dialog boxes.\n\nI also have CTS/RTS hardware flow control enabled, and I suggest that you\ndo the same.  Even if you only ever transfer 7-bit ASCII data, Xon/XOff is\nnot a sufficiently reliable method of flow control.  The informal (DEC)\nstandard for Xon/Xoff hysteresis is that the sender may transmit another\n16 (yes, sixteen) bytes after receipt of the Xoff from the receiving\nsystem or device.  The 16 byte FIFO in the 16550 is clearly not big enough\nto let us rely exclusively on Xon/Xoff.  A well-respected datacomm\nengineer has informed me that the 16550's can't really do CTS/RTS all\nby itself in the DOS/Windows environment, so using data rates above\n115,200 may still be risky.\n\nEven with hardware flow control, a 16550 with TurboCom can still\nexperience overruns in very busy systems, with lots of apps running and\nserious swapping in progress. If this is your situation, you may need to\nbuy a co-processed COM board, but this will cost you more than a\n16550/TurboCom upgrade.  A review of two such boards, and a review of\nTurboCom, can be found in the Feb'93 issue of \"Windows Sources\" magazine.\nI suggest trying a 16550/TurboCom upgrade first, and experiment with\nprocess priorities and time slices if you are a \"power user\" whose\nthrashing system still runs into comm problems.\n\n\nClosing Soapbox Comments\n\nThe state of RS-232C serial datacomm support is an embarrassment across\nthe computer industry.  Because it is the oldest standard I/O interface,\nthe job of designing hardware and writing software often seems to be\nassigned to the least senior or lowest ranked engineers at computer\ncompanies.  The design of the average serial port is at least ten years\nbehind the state of the art. In my last job, with a major workstation\nvendor, I lobbied for improved serial ports when they were doing the\ninitial designs of a new system.  That family of machines was\nsubsequently introduced with 16550 ports.  However, this is the\nexception.  Few computer companies seem to have any champions for decent\nI/O.\n\nYou may as well learn what you can about serial I/O, because this\nsituation shows no sign of improving soon.  When V.FAST arrives, I expect\ncries of outrage from Windows users world-wide whose 8250 PCs \"sort of\"\nwork today with V.32, but will fail miserably with V.FAST.  Without a\nhardware-buffered UART (like the 16550) and without software drivers that\nuse that UART to best advantage, a V.FAST modem will be a waste of money.\n\nRegards,                                          1001-A East Harmony Road\nBob Niland                                        Suite 503\nInternet:  rjn@csn.org                            Fort Collins CO 80525\nCompuServe: 71044,2124                            (303) 223-5209\n\n                     Copyright 1993 Robert J.

{"text":"Classify the following data: There has been a lot of discussion about Tyre.  In sum, Ezekiel prophesied\nthat the place would be mashed and never rebuilt; as there are a lot of\npeople living there, it would appear that Ezekiel was not literally correct.\n\nThis doesn't bother me at all, because I understand the language Ezekiel used\ndifferently than do so-called Biblical literalists.  For example, it sometimes\nhappens that someone says \"My grandson is the cutest baby!\" and then turns\naround and sees the granddaughter and says \"Oh!  Isn't she the cutest thing!?\"\n\nThis person is not literally claiming to have lined up all the babies in the\nworld according to cuteness and discovered his own grandchildren tied for\nfirst.  Rather, he is trying to express his emotions using words that are very\nobject-oriented.  Because this example is one that is common to many people,\nnobody misunderstands the intent of the statements; the Bible, however, is\noften at the mercy of people who assume that everything within must be exactly\nliterally true.  For those people, the existence of Tyre is a problem; for me,\nit is not.\n\n\nTurning to the latest person trying to defend Ezekiel, we read this from\nJohn E King:\n\n\nNo, it implies nothing of the kind.  If you had nothing but the prophecy from\nEzekiel, and you were told you interpret it literally, you would never say\n\"Oh, he means that there will be houses and businesses and plants and stuff\nlike that.\"  You would read \"I will make you a bare rock\" and \"You will never\nbe rebuilt\", and you'd conclude that Tyre would be a bare rock.  The only way\nto get from `fishing nets' to `houses and buildings and a medium-large\npopulation' is if you KNOW that all that latter stuff is there.\n\nIn other words, your answer means that Ezekiel misled everybody who read the\nprophecy at the time it was written.  There is no way that, given a literal\nreading, they could read this passage and conclude \"medium-size city\".\n\nYou seem to feel that \"Never be rebuilt\" means \"be rebuilt\" -- maybe so, but\nit is hardly a `clear implication'.\n\n\n\n\nWell, no.  That's only a bit less than the population of Annapolis, where I'm\nfrom.  You know, the Naval Acadamy, the state capital, George Washington\nresigned his commission in the statehouse?  Annapolis may not be New York, but\nit's at least a two-horse town.\n\nBut supposing 22,000 people is a \"small town\" -- it's still 22,000 people\nMORE than Ezekiel predicted.\n\n\nAnd you've said nothing about the other problem.  In chapter 26, Ezekiel\npredicts that Nebuchadnezzar will will destroy Tyre and loot all their\nvaluables.  However, Nebuchadnezzar did NOT destroy Tyre, and in chapter 29\nEzekiel even quotes God as saying \"he and his army got no reward from the\ncampaign he led against Tyre.\"\n\nLet's ignore Alexander for a moment, and just pay attention to chapter 26.\nEzekiel says N. would destroy Tyre, and N. did NOT destroy Tyre.  Ezekiel says\nthat N. would plunder their valuables, but N. did NOT plunder their valuables.\n\nRegardless of what you think about Tyre _now_, the fact is that N. died before\nthe place was destroyed.  Ezekiel said N. was going to do it, and N. did not.\n\n *\n\nThis post is, of course, pointless.  Inerrantists have an amazing ability\nto rewrite the Bible as needed to fit whatever they want it to say.\n\nFor example, I expect Mr King to respond to the comments about Ezekiel 26\nby pulling some \"clear implications\" out of hat.\n\nWhen Ezekiel said that N. would \"demolish your towers\", that clearly implied\nthat the walls would still be standing so people would know where the towers\nused to be.  And when Ezekiel said that N. would \"demolish your fine houses\nand throw your stones, timber and rubble into the sea\", that clearly implied\nthat N. would never set foot on the island.  And when Ezekiel wrote that N.\nwould \"build a ramp up to your walls\", that clearly implies that N. would\nspend 13 years stomping around on the mainland and never get close to the\nwalls.\n\nSee?  A few \"clear implications\" that are totally contrary to the text, and\nyou can reconcile anything you want.\n","label":"talk.religion.misc"}

They are largely out of order.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nJune 11, 1992\ntedward@cs.cornell.edu (ME!)\n\n\nYou all know how things turned out.  The Orioles, Red Sox, and Yankees\nall disappeared.  The Jays and Tigers continued at essentially the\nexpected pace.  The Brewers and Indians cranked in the second half.\n\nThe Rangers predictably took a dive.  That shouldn't have surprised\nanybody.  Meanwhile, as predicted, the Mariners dropped behind the\nAngels and Royals.  They clearly didn't deserve the 22-33 record in\nJune.  The White Sox and A's upped their game a bit, while the Twins\ndropped off a little.  But for the most part things were as expected.\n\nOkay, so there were a few blatant errors.  But for a predictive\ncalculation, I thought this did pretty well.\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFrom CAVGEOE@YaleVM.YCC.Yale.Edu Tue Mar 31 16:36:34 1992\n\nHm.

Wrong on Bream and Mitchell.  A bit early on\nLonnie, as with Bielecki.  Didn't pick Sanders.  (Did anybody? :-)\n\n\nThree of them went, right?

The\nrest of the division was thoroughly mediocre.  The Yankees and Indians\n\"led\" with 76 wins, the Red Sox \"trailed\" with 73 wins.

He hit that well last year (after\nadjusting his stats for park and league and such); he hit better (on an\nabsolute scale) than Olson or Berryhill did.  By a lot.\n\nAs for rushing...  If there really is a qualitative difference between the\nminors and the majors that requires a period of adjustment (and I don't\nbelieve there is), then wouldn't you rather waste Lopez's 22-year old good\nseason than his 23-year old very good season or his 24-year-old excellent\nseason?  The sooner you get him acclimated, the more of his prime you get to\nuse.\n\n\nThe point was not that 17 AB is a significant sample, but rather that he\nhadn't done anything in spring training to cause even a blockhead manager\nto question whether his minor league numbers were for real, or to send him\ndown \"until he gets warmed up\".\n\n\nMost players are *never* ready for the bigs.  What does this have to do\nwith Javy Lopez?\n\n\nSee above.  \n\n\nBut I could apply the same reasoning to Frank Thomas or Barry Bonds.

{"text":"Classify the following data: \nBill, I have taken the time to explain that biblical scholars consider the\nJosephus reference to be an early Christian insert.  By biblical scholar I mean\nan expert who, in the course of his or her research, is willing to let the\nchips fall where they may.  This excludes literalists, who may otherwise be\ndefined as biblical apologists.  They find what they want to find.  They are\nnot trustworthy by scholarly standards (and others).\n\nWhy an insert?  Read it - I have, a number of times.  The passage is glaringly\nout of context, and Josephus, a superb writer, had no such problem elsewhere \nin his work.  The passage has *nothing* to do with the subject matter in which \nit lies.  It suddenly appears and then just as quickly disappears.\n\nUntil you can demonstrate how and why the scholarly community is wrong about\nthe Josephus insert, your \"proof\" is meaningless and it should not be repeated\nhere.  What's more, even if Josephus happened to be legitimate, it would \"prove\"\nnothing.  Scholars speak of the \"weight of evidence.\"  Far more independent\nevidence would be required to validate your claim.  Until forthcoming, your\nbelief is based on faith.  That's OK, but you exceed your rights when you pass\nfaith off as fact.\n\nAs for the gospels, there are parallels, but there are also glaring\ninconsistencies and contradictions.  Shouldn't a perfect canon be perfect? \nShouldn't there be absolutely no room for debate?  I suggest you read _Gospel \nFictions_ by Randel Helms, and _The Unauthorized Version_ by Robin Fox (for \nHerb Huston, no known kinship or familial relationship, but we do indeed share \nan evolutionary ancestry).\n\nThe fact that there are inconsistencies, gaps and contradictions does not deny\nyour position.  On the other hand, neither do the gospels \"prove\" your faith. \nIndependent evidence is necessary, and I know of none (which we have already\ndiscussed, and so far you have not provided any).  Until then, its faith. \nMoreover, you have committed a fundamental error in logic.  You have attempted\nto \"prove\" your claim with that which you want to prove.  Its no different than\nsaying \"I am right because I say so.\"  \n\nYour logic is full of circles.  It reminds me a bit of the 1910 Presbyterian \nGeneral Assembly.  The assembly defined five fundamentals (this is where\n\"fundamentalist\" came from) of orthodox Protestant Christianity, to wit: 1)\nJesus performed miracles, 2) Jesus was born of a virgin, 3) Jesus was bodily\nresurrected, 4) Jesus' crucifixion atoned for human sin, and - here is the\nclincher - 5) the bible is the inerrant word of God.  Presbyterians construe\n\"inerrant\" broadly as spritually inerrant.  Fundamentalists take the\nfirst four as literally true, and then validate them with a literally inerrant\nbible, which contains the first four, and which is the only thing known to \ncontain the first four.  \n\nSmoke and mirrors and wands and hand waving if ever there was!\n\nIts faith, Bill.

April 23, 1993\n(Phone:  202/358-1780)\n\nKyle Herring\nJohnson Space Center, Houston\n(Phone:  713/483-5111)\n\nRELEASE:  93-76\n\nHUBBLE TELESCOPE SERVICING MISSION SCHEDULED FOR ELEVEN DAYS\n\n\tThe December flight of Endeavour on Space Shuttle mission STS-61 to\nservice the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) has been scheduled as an 11 day\nmission designed to accommodate a record five spacewalks with the capability\nfor an additional two, if needed.\n\n\tThe decision to schedule five extravehicular activities, or EVAs, was\nreached following extensive evaluations of underwater training, maneuver times\nrequired using the Shuttle's robot arm based on software simulations and actual\nEVA tasks on previous missions.\n\n\t\"Basically what we've done by going to five EVAs rather than three is\nto repackage our margin so that we have the capability to respond to the\ndynamics, or unknowns, of spacewalks,\" Mission Director Randy Brinkley said.\n\"It improves the probabilities for mission success while providing added\nflexibility and adaptability for reacting to real-time situations.\"\n\n\tIn laying out the specific tasks to be completed on each of the\nspacewalks, officials have determined that changing out the gyros, solar arrays\nand the Wide Field/Planetary Camera (WF/PC) and installing the Corrective\nOptics Space Telescope Axial Replacement (COSTAR) are priority objectives\nduring the mission.\n\n\t\"When we looked at accomplishing all of the tasks, highest through\nlowest priority, and recognizing that the major tasks -- gyros, solar arrays,\nWF/PC and COSTAR -- would consume most of the time set aside for each\nspacewalk, five EVAs were deemed appropriate,\" said Milt Heflin, Lead Flight\nDirector for the mission.\n\n\tWhile the five spacewalks will be unprecedented, the use of two\nalternating spacewalk teams will alleviate placing more stress on the crew than\nprevious missions requiring two, three or four EVAs.\n\n\t\"We have paid close attention to lessons learned during previous\nspacewalks and factored these into our timeline estimates for five EVAs,\"\nHeflin said.  \"In planning for all Space Shuttle missions, it is necessary to\nformulate a work schedule that represents as realistic a timeline as possible\nto accomplish the mission objectives.\"\n\n\tPlanning currently calls for at least five water tank training sessions\nthat include support from the Mission Control Center, called joint integrated\nsimulations, lasting between 10 and 36 hours.  In addition, many stand alone\nunderwater training \"runs\" will practice individual tasks in each spacewalk.\n\n\tVarious refinements to the specific tasks on each spacewalk will be\nmade based on actual training experience during the months prior to the\nmission.  Also, lessons learned from other spacewalks leading up to the flight\nwill be valuable in assisting the STS-61 crew in its training techniques.\n\n\tEndeavour's June flight and Discovery's July mission both will include\nspacewalks to evaluate some of the unique tools to be used on the HST mission.\nThe evaluations will help in better understanding the differences between the\nactual weightlessness of space and the ground training in the water tanks at\nthe Johnson Space Center, Houston, and the Marshall Space Flight Center,\nHuntsville, Ala.\n\n\tAlso, the inflight spacewalking experiences will assist in gaining\nfurther insight into the time required for the various tasks and expand the\nexperience levels among the astronaut corps, the flight controllers and\ntrainers.\n\n\tDesigned to be serviced by a Space Shuttle crew, Hubble was built with\ngrapple fixtures and handholds to assist in the capture and repair procedures.\n\n\tThe telescope was launched aboard Discovery in April 1990.  At that\ntime the NASA mixed fleet manifest showed the first revisit mission to HST in\n1993 to change out science instruments and make any repairs that may have\nbecome necessary.","label":"sci.space"}

It was filed on behalf of about 12,000\nanti-apartheid activists or opponents of Israeli policies about whom the\nplaintiffs believe the ADL, Bullock and Gerard gathered information.\n     Representatives of the ADL in San Francisco were not immediately available\nfor comment on Wednesday.\n     The civil suit is the first legal action arising out of allegations that\nGerard, a former inspector in the San Francisco police intelligence unit, passed\nconfidential police files on California political activists to a spy ring.\n     The FBI and San Francisco police are investigating the ADL, Bullock and\nGerard over the affair and last week searched the ADL's offices in San Francisco\nand Los Angeles.\n     The suit alleges invasion of privacy under the Civil Code of California,\nwhich prohibits the publication of information obtained from official sources.\nIt seeks exemplary damages of at least $2,500 per person as well as other\nunspecified damages.\n     Lawyer Pete McCloskey, a former Congresmen who is representing the\nplaintiffs, said the 19 plaintiffs included Arab-Americans and Jews -- and his\nwife Helen, who also had information gathered about her.\n     One of the plaintiffs is Yigal Arens, a research scientist at the\nUniversity of Southern California who is a son of the former Israeli Defence\nMinister.\n     Arens told the San Francisco Examiner he had seen a file the ADL kept on\nhim in the 1980s, presumably because of his criticism of the treatment of\nPalestinians and his position on the Israeli-occupied territories.\n     According to court documents released last week, Bullock and Gerard both\nkept information on thousands of California political activists.\n     In the documents, a police investigator said he believed the ADL paid\nBullock for many years to provide information and that both the league and\nBullock received confidential information from the authorities.\n     No criminal charges have yet been filed in the case. The ADL, Bullock and\nGerard have all denied any wrongdoing.\n  REUTER AC KG CM\n\n\n\nAPn  04/14 2202  ADL Lawsuit\n\nCopyright, 1993. The Associated Press.

None\nof us is violent or criminal in any way,\" said Carol El-Shaieb, an education\nconsultant who develops programs on Arab culture.\n   The 19 plaintiffs include Yigal Arens, son of former Israel Defense Minister\nMoshe Arens. The younger Arens, a research scientist at the University of\nSouthern California, said the ADL kept a file on him in the 1980s presumably\nbecause he has criticized Israel's treatment of Palestinians.\n   \"The ADL believes that anyone who is an Arab American ... or speaks\npolitically against Israel is at least a closet anti-Semite,\" Arens said.\n   The ADL has denied any wrongdoing, but couldn't comment on the lawsuit\nbecause it hasn't reviewed it, said a spokesman at the ADL's New York\nheadquarters.\n   The FBI and local police and prosecutors are investigating allegations that\nthe ADL spied on thousands of individuals and hundreds of groups, including\nwhite supremacist and anti-Semitic organizations, Arab-Americans, Greenpeace,\nthe National Association for the Advancement of Colored People and San Francisco\npublic television station KQED.\n   Some information allegedly came from confidential police and government\nrecords, according to court documents filed in the probe and the civil lawsuit.\nNo charges have been filed in the criminal investigation.\n   The lawsuit accuses the ADL of violating California's privacy law, which\nforbids the intentional disclosure of personal information \"not otherwise\npublic\" from state or federal records.\n   The lawsuit claims the ADL disclosed the information to \"persons and\nentities\" who had no compelling need to receive it. It didn't elaborate.\n   Defendants include Richard Hirschhaut, director of the ADL's office in San\nFrancisco. He did not immediately return a phone call seeking comment.\n   Other defendants are San Francisco art dealer Roy Bullock, an alleged ADL\ninformant over the past four decades, and former police officer Tom Gerard.\nGerard allegedly tapped into law enforcement and government computers and passed\ninformation on to Bullock.\n   Gerard, who has retired from the police force, has moved to the Philippines.\nBullock's lawyer, Richard Breakstone, said he could not comment on the lawsuit\nbecause he had not yet studied it.\n\n\n\n\n\nUPwe 04/14 1956  ADL sued for allegedly spying on U.S. residents","label":"talk.politics.mideast"}

EDT\n             \n             \n             THE PRESIDENT:  Good morning.  My voice is coming to\nyou this morning through the facilities of the oldest radio\nstation in America, KDKA in Pittsburgh.  I'm visiting the city to\nmeet personally with citizens here to discuss my plans for jobs,\nhealth care and the economy.  But I wanted first to do my weekly\nbroadcast with the American people. \n             \n             I'm told this station first broadcast in 1920 when\nit reported that year's presidential elections.  Over the past\nseven decades presidents have found ways to keep in touch with\nthe people, from whistle-stop tours to fire-side chats to the bus\ntour that I adopted, along with Vice President Gore, in last\nyear's campaign.\n             \n             Every Saturday morning I take this time to talk with\nyou, my fellow Americans, about the problems on your minds and\nwhat I'm doing to try and solve them.  It's my way of reporting\nto you and of giving you a way to hold me accountable.\n             \n             You sent me to Washington to get our government and\neconomy moving after years of paralysis and policy and a bad\nexperiment with trickle-down economics.  You know how important\nit is for us to make bold, comprehensive changes in the way we do\nbusiness.  \n             \n             We live in a competitive global economy.  Nations\nrise and fall on the skills of their workers, the competitiveness\nof their companies, the imagination of their industries, and the\ncooperative experience and spirit that exists between business,\nlabor and government.  Although many of the economies of the\nindustrialized world are now suffering from slow growth, they've\nmade many of the smart investments and the tough choices which\nour government has for too long ignored.  That's why many of them\nhave been moving ahead and too many of our people have been\nfalling behind.\n             \n             We have an economy today that even when it grows is\nnot producing new jobs.  We've increased the debt of our nation\nby four times over the last 12 years, and we don't have much to\nshow for it.  We know that wages of most working people have\nstopped rising, that most people are working longer work weeks\nand that too many families can no longer afford the escalating\ncost of health care.\n             \n             But we also know that, given the right tools, the\nright incentives and the right encouragement, our workers and\nbusinesses can make the kinds of products and profits our economy\nneeds to expand opportunity and to make our communities better\nplaces to live.\n             \n             In many critical products today Americans are the\nlow cost, high quality producers.  Our task is to make sure that\nwe create more of those kinds of jobs.\n             \n             Just two months ago I gave Congress my plan for\nlong-term jobs and economic growth.  It changes the old\npriorities in Washington and puts our emphasis where it needs to\nbe -- on people's real needs, on increasing investments and jobs\nand education, on cutting the federal deficit, on stopping the\nwaste which pays no dividends, and redirecting our precious\nresources toward investment that creates jobs now and lays the\ngroundwork for robust economic growth in the future.\n             \n             These new directions passed the Congress in record\ntime and created a new sense of hope and opportunity in our\ncountry.  Then the jobs plan I presented to Congress, which would\ncreate hundreds of thousands of jobs, most of them in the private\nsector in 1993 and 1994, passed the House of Representatives.  It\nnow has the support of a majority of the United States Senate. \nBut it's been held up by a filibuster of a minority in the\nSenate, just 43 senators.  They blocked a vote that they know\nwould result in the passage of our bill and the creation of jobs.\n             \n             The issue isn't politics; the issue is people. \nMillions of Americans are waiting for this legislation and\ncounting on it, counting on us in Washington.  But the jobs bill\nhas been grounded by gridlock.  \n             \n             I know the American people are tired of business as\nusual and politics as usual.  I know they don't want us to spin\nor wheels.  They want the recovery to get moving.  So I have\ntaken a first step to break this gridlock and gone the extra\nmile.  Yesterday I offered to cut the size of this plan by 25\npercent -- from $16 billion to $12 billion.  \n             \n             It's not what I'd hoped for.  With 16 million\nAmericans looking for full-time work, I simply can't let the bill\nlanguish when I know that even a compromise bill will mean\nhundreds of thousands of jobs for our people.  The mandate is to\nact to achieve change and move the country forward.  By taking\nthis initiative in the face of an unrelenting Senate talkathon, I\nthink we can respond to your mandate and achieve a significant\nportion of our original goals.\n             \n             First, we want to keep the programs as much as\npossible that are needed to generate jobs and meet human needs,\nincluding highway and road construction, summer jobs for young\npeople, immunization for children, construction of waste water\nsites, and aid to small businesses.  We also want to keep funding\nfor extended unemployment compensation benefits, for people who\nhave been unemployed for a long time because the economy isn't\ncreating jobs.\n             \n             Second, I've recommended that all the other programs\nin the bill be cut across-the-board by a little more than 40\npercent.\n             \n             And third, I've recommended a new element in this\nprogram to help us immediately start our attempt to fight against\ncrime by providing $200 million for cities and towns to rehire\npolice officers who lost their jobs during the recession and put\nthem back to work protecting our people.  I'm also going to fight\nfor a tough crime bill because the people of this country need it\nand deserve it.\n             \n             Now, the people who are filibustering this bill --\nthe Republican senators -- say they won't vote for it because it\nincreases deficit spending, because there's extra spending this\nyear that hasn't already been approved.  That sounds reasonable,\ndoesn't it?  Here's what they don't say.  This program is more\nthan paid for by budget cuts over my five-year budget, and this\nbudget is well within the spending limits already approved by the\nCongress this year.\n             \n             It's amazing to me that many of these same senators\nwho are filibustering the bill voted during the previous\nadministration for billions of dollars of the same kind of\nemergency spending, and much of it was not designed to put the\nAmerican people to work.  \n             \n             This is not about deficit spending.  We have offered\na plan to cut the deficit.  This is about where your priorities\nare -- on people or on politics.  \n             \n             Keep in mind that our jobs bill is paid for dollar\nfor dollar.  It is paid for by budget cuts.  And it's the\nsoundest investment we can now make for ourselves and our\nchildren.  I urge all Americans to take another look at this jobs\nand investment program; to consider again the benefits for all of\nus when we've helped make more American partners working to\nensure the future of our nation and the strength of our economy.\n             \n             You know, if every American who wanted a job had\none, we wouldn't have a lot of the other problems we have in this\ncountry today.  This bill is not a miracle, it's a modest first\nstep to try to set off a job creation explosion in this country\nagain.  But it's a step we ought to take.  And it is fully paid\nfor over the life of our budget.\n             \n             Tell your lawmakers what you think.  Tell them how\nimportant the bill is.  If it passes, we'll all be winners.\n             \n             Good morning, and thank you for listening.","label":"talk.politics.misc"}

{"text":"Classify the following data: This kind of argument cries for a comment...\n\n\n \n: >>...God did not create\n: >>disease nor is He responsible for the maladies of newborns.\n: > \n: >>What God did create was life according to a protein code which is\n: >>mutable and can evolve.  Without delving into a deep discussion of\n: >>creationism vs evolutionism, God created the original genetic code\n: >>perfect and without flaw. \n: >  ~~~~~~~     ~~~~~~~ ~~~~\n\nDo you have any evidence for this? If the code was once perfect, and\nhas degraded ever since, we _should_ have some evidence in favour\nof this statement, shouldn't we?\n\nPerhaps the biggest \"imperfection\" of the code is that it is full\nof non-coding regions, introns, which are so called because they\nintervene with the coding regions (exons). An impressive amount of\nevidence suggests that introns are of very ancient origin; it is\nlikely that early exons represented early protein domains.\n\nIs the number of introns decreasing or increasing? It appears that\nintron loss can occur, and species with common ancestry usually\nhave quite similar exon-intron structure in their genes. \n\nOn the other hand, the possibility that introns have been inserted\nlater, presents several logical difficulties. Introns are removed\nby a splicing mechanism - this would have to be present, but unused,\nif introns are inserted. Moreover, intron insertion would have\nrequired _precise_ targeting - random insertion would not be tolerated,\nsince sequences for intron removal (self-splicing of mRNA) are\nconserved. Besides, transposition of a sequence usually leaves a\ntrace - long terminal repeats and target - site duplications, and\nthese are not found in or near intron sequences. \n\nI seriously recommend reading textbooks on molecular biology and\ngenetics before posting \"theological arguments\" like this. \nTry Watson's Molecular Biology of the Gene or Darnell, Lodish\n& Baltimore's Molecular Biology of the Cell for starters.\n\n: Remember, the question was posed in a theological context (Why does\n: God cause disease in newborns?), and my answer is likewise from a\n: theological perspective -- my own.  It is no less valid than a purely\n: scientific perspective, just different.\n\nScientific perspective is supported by the evidence, whereas \ntheological perspectives often fail to fulfil this criterion.\n \n: I think you misread my meaning.  I said God made the genetic code perfect,\n: but that doesn't mean it's perfect now.  It has certainly evolved since.\n\nFor the worse? Would you please cite a few references that support\nyour assertion? Your assertion is less valid than the scientific\nperspective, unless you support it by some evidence.\n\nIn fact, it has been claimed that parasites and diseases are perhaps\nmore important than we've thought - for instance, sex might\nhave evolved as defence against parasites. (This view is supported by\ncomputer simulations of evolution, eg Tierra.) \n \n: Perhaps.  I thought it was higher energy rays like X-rays, gamma\n: rays, and cosmic rays that caused most of the damage.\n\nIn fact, it is thermal energy that does most of the damage, although\nit is usually mild and easily fixed by enzymatic action. \n\n: Actually, neither of us \"knows\" what the atmosphere was like at the\n: time when God created life.  According to my recollection, most\n: biologists do not claim that life began 4 billion years ago -- after\n: all, that would only be a half billion years or so after the earth\n: was created.  It would still be too primitive to support life.  I\n: seem to remember a figure more like 2.5 to 3 billion years ago for\n: the origination of life on earth.  Anyone with a better estimate?\n\nI'd replace \"created\" with \"formed\", since there is no need to \ninvoke any creator if the Earth can be formed without one.\nMost recent estimates of the age of the Earth range between 4.6 - 4.8\nbillion years, and earliest signs of life (not true fossils, but\norganic, stromatolite-like layers) date back to 3.5 billion years.\nThis would leave more than billion years for the first cells to\nevolve.\n\nI'm sorry I can't give any references, this is based on the course\non evolutionary biochemistry I attended here. \n\n: >>dominion, it was no great feat for Satan to genetically engineer\n: >>diseases, both bacterial/viral and genetic.  Although the forces of\n: >>natural selection tend to improve the survivability of species, the\n: >>degeneration of the genetic code tends to more than offset this.  \n\nAgain, do you _want_ this be true, or do you have any evidence for\nthis supposed \"degeneration\"? \n\nI can understand Scott's reaction:\n\n: > Excuse me, but this is so far-fetched that I know you must be\n: > jesting.  Do you know what pathogens are?  Do you know what \n: > Point Mutations are?  Do you know that EVERYTHING CAN COME\n: > ABOUT SPONTANEOUSLY?!!!!!  \n: \n: In response to your last statement, no, and neither do you.\n: You may very well believe that and accept it as fact, but you\n: cannot *know* that.\n\nI hope you don't forget this: We have _evidence_ that suggests \neverything can come about spontaneously. Do you have evidence against\nthis conclusion? In science, one does not have to _believe_ in \nanything. It is a healthy sign to doubt and disbelieve. But the \nright path to walk is to take a look at the evidence if you do so,\nand not to present one's own conclusions prior to this. \n\nTheology does not use this method. Therefore, I seriously doubt\nit could ever come to right conclusions.\n\n: >>Human DNA, being more \"complex\", tends to accumulate errors adversely\n: >>affecting our well-being and ability to fight off disease, while the \n: >>simpler DNA of bacteria and viruses tend to become more efficient in \n: >>causing infection and disease.  It is a bad combination.  Hence\n: >>we have newborns that suffer from genetic, viral, and bacterial\n: >>diseases/disorders.\n\nYou are supposing a purpose, not a valid move. Bacteria and viruses\ndo not exist to cause disease. They are just another manifests of\na general principle of evolution - only replication saves replicators\nfrom degradiation. We are just an efficient method for our DNA to \nsurvive and replicate. The less efficient methods didn't make it \nto the present. \n\nAnd for the last time.  Please present some evidence for your claim that\nhuman DNA is degrading through evolutionary processes. Some people have\nclaimed that the opposite is true - we have suppressed our selection,\nand thus are bound to degrade. I haven't seen much evidence for either\nclaim.\n \n: But then I ask, So?  Where is this relevant to my discussion in\n: answering John's question of why?  Why are there genetic diseases,\n: and why are there so many bacterial and viral diseases which require\n: babies to develop antibodies.  Is it God's fault? (the original\n: question) -- I say no, it is not.\n\nOf course, nothing \"evil\" is god's fault.  But your explanation does\nnot work, it fails miserably.\n \n: You may be right.  But the fact is that you don't know that\n: Satan is not responsible, and neither do I.\n: \n: Suppose that a powerful, evil being like Satan exists.  Would it\n: be inconceivable that he might be responsible for many of the ills\n: that affect mankind?  I don't think so.\n\nHe could have done a much better Job. (Pun intended.) The problem is,\nit seems no Satan is necessary to explain any diseases, they are\njust as inevitable as any product of evolution.\n\n: Did I say that?  Where?  Seems to me like another bad inference.\n: Actually what you've done is to oversimplify what I said to the\n: point that your summary of my words takes on a new context.  I\n: never said that people are \"meant\" (presumably by God) \"to be\n: punished by getting diseases\".  Why I did say is that free moral\n: choices have attendent consequences.  If mankind chooses to reject\n: God, as people have done since the beginning, then they should not\n: expect God to protect them from adverse events in an entropic\n: universe.\n\nI am not expecting this. If god exists, I expect him to leave us alone.\nI would also like to hear why do you believe your choices are indeed\nfree. This is an interesting philosophical question, and the answer\nis not as clear-cut as it seems to be.\n\nWhat consequences would you expect from rejecting Allah?\n  \n: Oh, I admit it's not perfect (yet).  But I'm working on it.  :)\n\nA good library or a bookstore is a good starting point.\n\n: What does this have to do with the price of tea in China, or the\n: question to which I provided an answer?  Biology and Genetics are\n: fine subjects and important scientific endeavors.  But they explain\n: *how* God created and set up life processes.  They don't explain\n: the why behind creation, life, or its subsequent evolution.\n\nWhy is there a \"why behind\"? And your proposition was something\nthat is not supported by the evidence. This is why we recommend\nthese books.\n\nIs there any need to invoke any why behind, a prime mover? Evidence\nfor this? If the whole universe can come into existence without\nany intervention, as recent cosmological theories (Hawking et al)\nsuggest, why do people still insist on this?\n \n: Thanks Scotty, for your fine and sagely advice.  But I am\n: not highly motivated to learn all the nitty-gritty details\n: of biology and genetics, although I'm sure I'd find it a\n: fascinating subject.  For I realize that the details do\n: not change the Big Picture, that God created life in the\n: beginning with the ability to change and adapt to its\n: environment.\n\nI'm sorry, but they do. There is no evidence for your big picture,\nand no need to create anything that is capable of adaptation.\nIt can come into existence without a Supreme Being.\n\nTry reading P.W.

The critical information from the neuron is in\nthe firing frequency (maximum about 100 action potentials per\nseconds), and not in the amplitude of the signal or in details of the\nsignal shape. So the resolution of about 0.4 % you get with an 8 bit\nconvertor is more then sufficient.\n\nAC coupling does not have to be a problem either, since in many cases\nyou are not interested in the DC level. My pre amplifier is AC coupled\nalso. The critical point is the lowest frequency that will pass. If\nthe cutoff point is to high, the action potentials will be slightly\ndistorted. But even that normally does not matter since it is the\noccurrence of the spike that is important. \n\nHowever, I do want to know what exactly I can expect before I start\nbattling with the toolbox to get it going.

Archie\n  provides information about files available for ftp anywhere on the\n  Internet; Xarchie displays this information using an easy-to-use,\n  point-and-click interface.  Xarchie allows you to further explore ftp\n  sites by examining directories returned as query matches, and allows\n  you to retrieve files located this way.\n\nXarchie 2.0 has been extensively tested on R4, R5, and a variety of\nother flavors of X, and on a wide range of machines. A summary of the\nnew features (from the README) follows:\n\n  * Major improvements include:\n    - Multiple selections allowed in browser for use with other new\n      features (FWF MultiList widget).\n    - Ability to expand directories in browser.\n    - Real fully-integrated ftp implementation.\n    - Ability to save and reload query results, as well as print them.\n    - Ability to resort results, and sort results by user-definable\n      pseudo-weights.\n    - Online help browser.\n    - Color resources, done so that they don't break mono displays.\n    - FWF FileSelector widget for local file operations.\n    - Makefile.dst's supplied for the imake-impaired.\n\nGeorge","label":"comp.windows.x"}

I've\ntried several combinations:\n\ncontroller - master - slave\ncontroller - slave - master\nmaster - controller - slave\n\nNone of them worked.  Unfortunately, I can't think of any others.\n\nAnother possibility is that the 85MB one is already partitioned into\ntwo seperate drives, C and D, and the CMOS asks for \"C: drive\" and \"D:\ndrive\" setup info rather than \"drive 1\" and \"drive 2\" like most others\nI've seen.  Could this be confusing things?\n\nSo, I need HELP!  The drive came bereft of any docs, except for some\ninfo for the CMOS setup; the controller has a little piece of paper\nabout the size of an index card; I cannibalized the cable (it's one\nof those with a connector at each end and the one in the middle, so\nit looks like a serial connection); now I be lost!\n\nMany, many thanks in advance!

(now what does require\nsome faith is the belief that my senses give an accurate representation\nof what's out there....) But there is NO evidence - pro or con -\nfor the existence or non-existence of God (see what I have to\nsay below on this).\n\n\nSorry if I remain skeptical - I don't believe it's entirely a\nconclusion. That you have seen no evidence that there IS a God\nis correct - neither have I. But lack of evidence for the existence \nof something is in NO WAY evidence for the non-existence of something \n(the creationist have a similar mode of argumentation in which if they \ndisprove evolution the establish creation). You (personally) have never \nseen a neutrino before, but they exist. The \"pink unicorn\" analogy breaks\ndown and is rather naive. I have a scientific theory that explains the \nappearance of animal life - evolution. When I draw the conclusion that \n\"pink unicorns\" don't exist because I haven't seen them, this conclusion\nhas it's foundation in observation and theory. A \"pink unicorn\", if\nit did exist, would be qualitatively similar to other known entities.\nThat is to say, since there is good evidence that all life on earth has\nevolved from \"more primitive\" ancestors these pink unicorns would share \na common anscestory with horses and zebras and such. God, however,\nhas no such correspondence with anything (IMO). There is no physical\nframe work of observation to draw ANY conclusions FROM. \n\n\n\n\nI disagree with you profoundly on this. I haven't defined God as\nexistence - in fact, I haven't defined God. But this might be\ngetting off the subject - although if you think it's relevant\nwe can come back to it. \n\n\nYou are using wrong categories here - or perhaps you misunderstand\nwhat I'm saying. I'm making no argument what so ever and offering no\ndefinition so there is no fallacy. I'm not trying to convince you of\nanything. *I* Believe - and that rests upon Faith. And it is inappropriate\nto apply the category of logic in this realm (unless someone tells you\nthat they can logically prove God or that they have \"evidence\" or ...,\nthen the use of logic to disprove their claims if fine and necessary).\n\nBTW, an incomplete argument is not a fallacy - some things are not\nEVEN wrong. \n\n\nI don't follow you here. Certainly one can make observations of\nthings that they didn't know existed. I still maintain that one\ncannot use observation to infer that \"God does not exist\". Such\na positive assertion requires a leap.  \n\n\n\n\nOnce again you seem to completely misunderstand me. I have no\nEVIDENCE that \"'god is' is meaningful\" at ANY level. Maybe such\na response as you gave just comes naturally to you because so\nmany people try to run their own private conception of God down\nyour throat. I, however, am not doing this. I am arguing one, and\nonly one, thing - that to make a positive assertion about something\nfor which there can in principle be no evidence for or against\nrequires a leap - it requires faith. I am, as you would say, a\n\"theist\"; however, there is a form of atheism that I can respect -\nbut it must be founded upon honesty. \n\n\n\n","label":"alt.atheism"}

{"text":"Classify the following data: : I would like to get your opinions on this: when exactly does an engaged\n: couple become \"married\" in God's eyes?  Some say that if the two have\n: publically announced their plans to marry, have made their vows to God, and\n: are unswervingly committed to one another (I realize this is a subjective\n: qualifier) they are married/joined in God's sight.\n\nThe way I read Scripture, a couple becomes married when they are *physically*\nmarried, i.e. when they first have sexual intercourse.\n\ne.g. the end of Genesis 2 (quoted from memory) ``for this reason, a man shall\nleave his parents and be joined to his wife, and they will become one flesh''\n(Jesus also quotes this scripture referring to marriage).\n\nIf you read through Genesis in particular, you will often come across the\nphraseology: ``[man] lay with [woman], and she became his wife''. This\nimplies that she became his wife when they lay together, i.e. at the\npoint of intercourse.\n\nCompare this with Jewish tradition: Joseph, when he heard that Mary\nwas pregnant, had it in mind to divorce her quietly -- but Mary and Joseph were\n*betrothed*, not married. i.e., they were in a binding relationship (which\nrequired a divorce to get out of), but *marriage* would not occur until Mary\nand Joseph went to bed together.\n\nCompare with Christ and the Church (Ephesians 5, Revelation 19): the church is\ndescribed as the ``bride'' of Christ, but the *marriage* of the Lamb takes \nplace when Jesus returns. i.e., we are in a binding love-relationship with\nJesus, but we are still looking forward to the time when the marriage will\ntake place. I see this as the spiritual equivalent of sexual intercourse,\nbecause it represents the most intimate fellowship possible between man and God.\n\nIn summary, engagement should be honoured as a binding relationship, but it is\nnot marriage. A civil ceremony is not marriage either. Marriage occurs at the\npoint when the betrothed couple go to bed together. (I don't mean to demean the\ncivil or church ceremony -- ours was great! I don't mean to be too pedantic.)\nHistorically, I think I am correct in stating that the civil ceremony (i.e. a\nmarriage recognised by the state), has only been around in the West since\nNapoleon, who introduced it to keep tabs on the people (although I'm ready to be\ncorrected on that point!)\n\nThis view obviously raises some questions:\n\nWhat about those who have had sex with one or more partners, without considering\nmarriage. Are those people also ``married''?\n\nIf it is true that marriage occurs at the point of intercourse, is it necessary\nto be married in the eyes of the state? (I would say Yes, because this honours\nthe laws of our nations in the West. Although it is not illegal to sleep\ntogether though unmarried in most Western countries, I believe that it is God-\nhonouring to proclaim our marriage to the state and to our friends before\nactually consummating our marriage. Its to do with our being salt and light, and\nalso to do with how people will perceive us; i.e. it is culturally insensitive\nto declare yourself married without going through a civil ceremony.)\n\n-- \n\n-----\nMichael Davis (cs89mcd@brunel.ac.uk)","label":"soc.religion.christian"}

{"text":"Classify the following data: \nCan anybody name a player who was 'rushed' to the majors (let's, for\nargument's sake, define \"rushed\" as brought up to the majors for more than\na cup of coffee prior at age 22 or younger, and performing below\nexpectations), whose career was damaged by this rushing?  I'm serious; I\ntend to agree with David that bringing the player up sooner is better, but\nI'd like to look at players for whom this theory didn't work, if there are\nany.  I'd prefer players within the last 10 years or so, because then I can\nlook up their minor league stats.  (It's important to distinguish between\nplayers who legitimately had careers below what their minor league numbers\nwould have projected, as opposed to players who were hyped and failed, but\nactually had careers not out of line with their minor league numbers).  \n\nLet's kick it off with an example of a player who was \"rushed\", although\nthere doesn't seem to have been any damage to his career.  Jay Bell was\ngiven 135 PAs in the major leagues at age 21, and performed well below what\nyou would expect from his AAA numbers the same season.  He got 236 PAs the\nnext year at age 22, and still underperformed.  However, the next year, at\nage 24, his performance improved, and he won the everyday shortstop job,\nand has been there ever since.  It's really hard for me to see where he\nwould have been better off staying in the minor league (where he was\nperformed quite well in AAA) during this time, rather than being \"rushed\";\nCleveland might have been better off, I suppose, because they might have\nbeen less likely to give up on him.\n\nYes, if you bring a player up early, he's likely going to struggle.  But\ndoes that delay the time at which he stops struggling, and starts\nperforming up to expectations?","label":"rec.sport.baseball"}

{"text":"Classify the following data: \n\n\nNo, you have completely misunderstood.

In the case of Bosnia, the risks are obviously much\ngreater, and there are other countries in a much better position and with far\nbetter reasons to take action than the US.\n\n\nYou continue to misunderstand.  I did not say the reason why people want to\nintervene is because of racist (<- you seem to be overly fond of using this\nword, btw.  I said the phenomenon was race-related, which is not the same as\nracist.  Perhaps this distinction is too subtle for you to grasp) motives - I\nsaid the attention and outrage at the entire Yugoslavian situation was a result\nof it being 1) closer to home, 2) happening to people we can identify with, and\n3) relentlessly harped on by the media.

{"text":"Classify the following data: \nNo one else seems to know, so I'll post this.\n\nThis topic came up on sci.physics.fusion shortly after the cold-fusion\nflap started.  As I recall, its been done to some experimental mice.\nThey showed various ill effects and eventually died.  The reason is\nthat deuterium does not have exactly the same reaction rates as\nhydrogen due to its extra mass (which causes lower velocity, Boltzman\nconstant, mumble).  This throws various bits of body biochemistry out\nof kilter, and you get sick and die.\n\nI've never heard of anyone being poisened this way, in or out of real\nlife.  The process takes quite a while.  If anyone wants to write this\nbook, I would imagine you would have to:\n\n1: Replace a significant fraction of the water in the body with heavy\n   water.\n\n2: Wait while normal breakdown and repair processes cause other\n   molecules in the body to be synthesised using the deuterium.\n\nDuring this process the victim would gradually deteriorate and\neventually die, but I imagine it would take weeks during which the\npoisoner would have to ensure that a significant proportion of the\nwater the victim ingested was heavy.\n\nYou would get such a mess of symptoms that the doctors would be both\nalarmed and confused.  Why should every organ in the body suddenly\nbegin to deteriorate?  If you can figure out how the poisoner gets the\nheavy water into the victim in a hospital then you could have a real\nstory here.\n\nCome to think of it, <2> would continue even after the heavy water was\nno longer being ingested, so hospitalisation might be too late.\n\nThe most detectable effect would be that the victim's body fluids\nwould literally be \"heavy\".  Water has a molecular weight of 18 and\nheavy water has a MW of 20.  Thus the victim's weight will increase by\nabout 1% for every 10% of body water replaced by heavy water.  Maybe\nthe detection occurs because some pathologist in the lab notices that\nthe victim's urine is strangely dense.  Is there any medical test\ninvolving the specific gravity of a body fluid?\n\nPaul.","label":"sci.med"}

He will have mercy on whom he will have mercy and compassion on\nwhom he will have compassion (Ex 33:19).  However, if he enjoyed\npunishing people and sending them to hell, then why would he send Jesus\nto \"seek and save that which was lost\" (Luke 19:10)?\n\nYou asked for it.\n\n2 Peter 2:4-ff talks about how those who are ungodly are punished.\nMatthew 25:31-46 is also very clear that those who do not righteous in\nGod's eyes will be sent to hell for eternity.\n2 Thessalonians 1:6-10 states that those who cause trouble for the\ndisciples \"will be punished with everlasting destruction and shut out\nfrom the presence of the Lord\".\n2 Thessalonians 2:9-12 talks about those who refuse to love the truth\nbeing condemned.\nRevelation 21:6-8 talks about the difference between those who overcomes\nand those who do not.  Those who do not, listed in verse 8, will be in\nthe \"fiery lake of burning sulfur\".\nRevelation 14:9-12 gives the indication that those who follow the beast\n\"will be tormented with burning sulfur\" and there being \"no rest day or\nnight\" for them because of it.\nPsalm 9:17:  \"The wicked return to the grave, all the nations that\nforget God.\"\n\nI think those should be sufficient to prove the point.\n\n\nJoe Fisher\n\n[In the following I'm mostly playing \"devil's advocate\".  I'm not\nadvocating either position.  My concern is that people understand that\nit's possible to see these passages in different ways.  It's possible\nto see eternal destruction as just that -- destruction.  Rev often\nuses the term \"second death\".  The most obvious understanding of that\nwould seem to be final extinction.  The problem is that the NT speaks\nboth of eternal punishment and of second death.  I.e. it uses terms\nthat can be understood either way.  My concern here is not to convince\nyou of one view or the other, but to help people understand that\nthere's a wide enough variety of images that it's possible to\nunderstand them either way.  As Tom Albrecht commented, the primary\npoint is to do our best to keep people out of the eternal fire,\nwhatever the details.  (To make things more interesting, Luke 20:35\nimplies that the damned don't get resurrected at all.  Presumably\nthey just stay dead. -- yes I'm aware that it's possible to \nunderstand this passage in a non-literal way.)\n\n2 Peter 2:4-ff is talking about angels, and talks about holding them\nin hell until the final judgement.  This isn't eternal punishement.\n\nMatthew 25:31-46 talks about sending the cursed into eternal fire\nprepared for the devil and his angels.  The fact that the fire is\neternal doesn't mean that people will last in its flames forever.\nParticularly interesting is the comment about the fire having been\nprepared for the devil and his angels.  Rev 20 and 21 talk about the\neternal fire as well.  They say that the beast and the false prophet\nwill be tormented forever in it.  When talking about people being\nthrown into it (20:13-14), it is referred to as \"the second death\".\nThis sounds more like extinction than eternal torment.  Is is possible\nthat the fire has different effects on supernatural entities such as\nthe devil, and humans?\n\n2 Thessalonians 1:6-10 similarly, what is \"everlasting destruction\"?\nThis is not necessarily eternal torment.  This one can clearly be\nunderstood either way, but I think it's at least possible to think\nthat everlasting is being used to contrast the kind of destruction\nthat can occur in this life with the final destruction that occurs in\neternity.\n\n2 Thessalonians 2:8 again talks about destruction.\nRevelation 21:6-8: see comment above\nRevelation 14:9-12 is probably the best of the quotes.  Even there,\nit doesn't explicitly say that the people suffer forever.  It says\nthat the smoke (and presumably the fire) is eternal, and that \nthere is no respite from it.  But it doesn't say that the people\nare tormented forever.\n\nPsalm 9:17:  I don't see that it says anything relevant to this issue.","label":"soc.religion.christian"}

{"text":"Classify the following data: \nAn excellent idea.\n\n\nWhile I don't know the full scope of the activities of the EFF, \nfrom what little I've seen I think it would be better to lobby for \nstrong cryptography through a distinct organization.\n\nThe EFF has been associated with efforts to prevent the banning of sex\nand pictures newsgroups at various universities. Horror stories about the\ncontents of those groups (e.g. exploitative pictures of possibly underaged\nmodels) have already surfaced in the press. The White House bulletin\nalready raised the specter of drug-dealing and terrorism, which is only one\nstep removed from the old \"crypto-wielding child molester\" argument.  An\nEFF lobbying effort for cryptography would be too easily derailed by the\nconnection to child pornography and the like.\n\nSimilarly, LPF is connected with Stallman and his Gnu project.  In\nlight of, say, the Gnu Manifesto, this means that in a public debate it\nstands to be labelled as \"communist\", \"anarchist hackers\", radical, etc.  \n\nI don't know about CPSR, but if it is an offshoot of Physicians for Social\nResponsibility (best known for Helen Caldicott and her hysterical\nantinuclear lobbying) then it probably also carries unwelcome political\nbaggage.\n\nPerhaps for practical reasons a lobbying organization for cryptography\nwould best be formed under the umbrella of EFF or some other existing\ngroup, but its charter should then be distinct, independent, and limited to\nadvocacy for the right to cryptography.  To reiterate Dan Bernstein's\nquestion: does any suitable organization exist?  If not, what are you going\nto do about it?\n\nHaving mentioned the possible dangers of unwelcome political associations,\nI would be remiss not to suggest something in the opposite direction:\ngathering the support of the NRA by emphasizing the RKBA side of the\nissue as well as the First-Amendment side.\n\n","label":"sci.crypt"}

{"text":"Classify the following data: \n\nThe Bible does tell us that governments are ordained by God (Romans 13).\n And furthermore, God foreknows everything that would happen.  It is\njust to difficult for humans to graps with our limited minds, the\ninevitablity of the sucess of God's plan, and this is especially hard to\ngrasp when we see governemnts doing evil.  However, though they are\ndoing evil (and we should not cooperate with them when they do such), it\nmust be understood that what happens is what God wanted so as to lead to\nthe final sucess of His plan to save as many souls from hell as is\npossible.  In short, the slaughter in Bosnia, though deplorable in the\neyes of God (maybe, then again, they might be getting their just deserts\nnow rather than later; there are plenty of examples of God killing\npeople for their sins - Onan in the Old Testmament for example, and\nAnnias and Spahira in the New) is what he willed to happen so that His\nplan might be accomplished.\n    But don't forget, it is not unbiblical for God to use one nation to\nexecute His just judgement upon another.  The Romans were used to\nfulfill the chorus of \"Let his blood be upon our hands\" of the crowd in\nJersualem.  And Chaldea was chastised by Babylon, which got Israel,\nwhich was inturn gotten by Persia, etc.  God does use nations to punish\nother nations, as the Bible very clearly shows in the Old Testament. \nDon't you remember the words of God recorded in Daniel, \"Mene, mene,\ntekel, peres?\"  Babylon had been weighed in the balance scales of God's\njustice, found severly wanting, and was thus given over to the Persians\nas their due punishment for their rebellion.  Another exammple is the\nextirmination of the Cannanites, ordered by God as the task of Israel. \nThe Cannanites had been given their chance, found severly wanting, and\nthe Great Judge, carried out His just sentence accrodingly.  I could go\non with more examples, but I see little need to do so, as my point is\nquite clear.\nTwo things need to be remembered at all times. 1) It is not up to us to\nquestion why God has ordered the world as He has.  In His divine Wisdom,\nHe made the world as was best in His eyes, and like Paul says in Romans\n9, the clay is not one to tlak back to the potter.  2) The message of\nJesus Christ is as follows: \"Repent now, for the Kingdom of Heaven is at\nhand.\"  Jesus Christ did not allow any time for dilly-dallying - \"Let\nthe dead bury the dead, come, follow me.\"  There is not an infinite\namount of time, rather Christ is passing by right now, calling people to\nfollow Him and become fishers of men.  He does not say, \"well, alright,\nyou can call me back in a week and see if my Kingdom fits in with your\nplans.\"  He said \"Follow me.\"  His message is NOT \"I'm just a sweety-pie\nwho would never hurt a fly, you've got all the time in the world, and\nDivine Judgement, that's only a fairy tale.\"  \"Our great God and Savior\"\nJesus Christ (Titus 2.5) is also the just and righteous Judge of the\nworld.  And it is not up to the defendants in the trial to be\nquestioning his entirely just sentences of either chastisement or mercy.","label":"soc.religion.christian"}

{"text":"Classify the following data: Archive-name: rec-autos/part5\n\n[this article is one of a pair of articles containing commonly\nasked automotive questions; the other article contains questions\nmore geared to the automotive enthusiast, and so is not crossposted\nto misc.consumers.  -- rpw]\n\n   [changes as of 14 April 1993: revised brake fluid section, as\n    non-silicone DOT-5 fluids are now apparently available -- rpw]\n\n                 Commonly Asked Automotive Questions\n\n\nTire Questions:\n\nQ:  What do the funny numbers on the sides of my tires mean?\n\nA:  Typically, you will see something like 195/60HR14.  the 195 is the\n    overall width of the tire in millimeters, the tread is usually\n    narrower.  The 60 is the `aspect ratio'; it indicates the height of the\n    sidewall of the tire relative to the overall width.  Our example tire\n    has a sidewall height of 0.60 * 195 ~= 117 mm.  The 14 is the wheel\n    diameter in inches; there are also some special tires called `TRX'\n    tires which have three digit metric wheel diameter designations, like\n    390, which is in millimeters.  The R means Radial, and the H is a speed\n    rating indicating the highest speed at which the tire, when properly\n    inflated and carrying an appropriate load, may safely operate.  Common\n    speed ratings are S (112MPH), T (118MPH), H (130MPH), and V (up to\n    150MPH.)\n\n    Recent changes to the method for specifying tire sizes move the speed\n    rating to a different part of the designation; you may therefore find\n    designations like 195/60R14 85H; the 85 indicates the per-tire load\n    associated with the speed rating -- exceeding this load in continuous\n    operation at the rated speed is dangerous practice.  What follows is\n    a table showing a number of `load indices' and corresponding maximum\n    per-tire loads:\n\n    Load Index       50   51   88   89   112   113   145   149   157\n    Max Load (Kg)   190  195  560  580  1120  1150  2900  3250  4125\n\n    Note that the usual mass vs. weight confusion occurs in this table.\n\n    In some cases, the letters P or LT may be found in front of a tire\n    size; the LT designation indicates Light Truck, and the P designation\n    indicates Passenger car.  If no letter is given, then the application\n    of the tire is Passenger car usage.  As far as I know, these letters\n    only appear in the US market.  The LT designation is prinicipally of\n    interest to owners of light trucks and other utility vehicles.  For\n    the owner of a passenger vehicle, there is no meaningful difference\n    between a tire with a P designation and one with no designation at\n    all.\n\n    If the aspect ratio is omitted, it is probably 80, but may be 78.\n\n    Tires with an MS (mud/snow) designation may have their speed rating\n    reduced by 20 km/h (about 12mph.)\n\n    There is an additional set of ratings on tires for temperature,\n    traction, and treadwear.  Temperature and Traction are graded\n    A, B, and C (with A the best and C the worst); treadwear is\n    a numeric rating.  These values are of limited value, as they\n    are assigned somewhat arbitrarily by tire manufacturers and are\n    thus not useful in comparing different brands of tires.\n\nQ:  My car has tires with a funny size designation:  185/65HR390; can i put\n    normal tires on the car?\n\nA:  Your tires are called TRX tires; they were devised by Michelin.\n    Because of a somewhat different bead design, they are incompatible\n    with normal tires; Michelin used a different diameter wheel for them\n    so that they could not be mounted on the wrong type wheel (and so that\n    more conventional tires could not be mounted on TRX type wheels.)\n    You will need to aquire different wheels to put a normal tire on your\n    car; it is barely possible to fit normal tires on TRX wheels, and horribly\n    dangerous to do so (the tires may simply peel off the rims in a corner,\n    or possibly blow out at high speed.)  TRX type tires are becoming hard\n    to find; in addition to Michelin, Avon makes suitable tires.  Goodyear\n    has apparently discontinued their line of TRX tires.\n\nQ:  Can I rotate radials from side to side, or rotate them only on one side\n    of my car?\n\nA:  Car and tire manufacturers have differing views on this subject; many\n    say that swapping radials between the left and right hand sides of a\n    car is now ok (this group includes Michelin and Goodyear); others\n    (for example, Pirelli and Nokia) will void warranties if such swapping\n    is done.  The best advice is to read your tire manual carefully before\n    rotating your tires, and stick to the manufacturer's recommendations.\n\nQ:  How many snow tires should I buy, and if I buy 2, which end of the\n    car should I put them on?\n\nA:  In short, 4, and both ends.  To explain, many drivers in areas that don't\n    get excessive snow or who don't drive agressively (or at all) in snow\n    conditions get away with only two snows on the drive wheels, but there\n    are circumstances where this can be dangerous practice.  With a rear\n    wheel drive car, you can choose between being able to start the car\n    going (a function of the rear axle) or stopping and turning the car\n    (a function of the front axle.)  In a front wheel drive car, you start,\n    stop, and turn with the front end.  The primary risk of putting the\n    snow tires on the front only is that if you have to put on the brakes\n    while going downhill, you run a serious risk of going downhill backwards.\n\nRadar Detectors and Speed Limits:\n\nQ:  Why aren't there any comments on Radar Detectors and Speed Limits\n    in this Q&A posting?\n\nA:  Because questions about detectors and speed limits crossposted between\n    misc.consumers and rec.autos.* always start long, tedious, and pointless\n    flame wars.  If you want to talk about either of these topics, please\n    subscribe to rec.autos or alt.flame and keep it there.\n\nSafety Equipment:\n\nQ:  Do airbags really work?\n\nA:  Preliminary statistics suggest the following:  Airbags work much\n    better than no belts; good 3 point belts alone work much better than\n    Airbags alone, and AirBags + 3 point belts work slightly better than\n    3 point belts alone.  The con to airbags is that some designs tend\n    to burn the driver's hands when venting the byproducts of the\n    explosion that occurs inside the bag, and that some designs (but\n    not all) may knock the driver's hands from the wheel, making retention\n    of control of the vehicle after the bag deflates more difficult.\n\nBrake Questions:\n\nQ:  Do I always need to get the rotors on my disk brakes turned?  Midas\n    always wants to do this.\n\nA:  No.  There are specific conditions that mandate turning or replacing\n    rotors; some shops try and make a little extra money by replacing rotors\n    more often than is strictly necessary.  if the rotors are not warped\n    warped, and only lightly grooved, then there is no need to replace or\n    to turn them.  Note also that some rotors (the rotors on many Hondas\n    are a good example) are so narrow to begin with that it is not practical\n    to turn them; they must be replaced when they become too thin, warped,\n    or badly grooved.\n\nQ:  They tell me I should downshift when braking to slow my car down.  Is\n    this really a good idea?\n\nA:  It used to be a very good idea, back in the days of mediocre, fade\n    prone drum brakes.  In modern disc brake equipped cars, use of\n    downshifting to slow the car is not really necessary, except in cases\n    of long, steep downhill runs.  Otherwise, modern disc brakes are more\n    than adequate to stop a passenger car in all circumstances, and they\n    are much cheaper to repair than clutch linings.\n\n    On the other hand, many standard driver's license tests in the USA\n    still specify that the driver being tested downshift under braking; I\n    suggest that before taking a US driver's test, you either 1) learn to\n    do this smoothly (which takes some time and practice) or 2) borrow a\n    car with an automatic to take the test.\n\nQ:  How often should I replace my brake fluid?\n\nA:  Probably more often than you do.  Traditional brake fluids tend to\n    absorb water; this water can corrode internal parts of the brake\n    system and also lower the boiling point of the fluid.  DOT-3 type\n    are older fluids; DOT-4 and DOT-5 are newer specifications.  The\n    principal differences are in wet and dry boiling points; the dry\n    boiling point is important in fresh brake fluid, but the wet boiling\n    point is important in older brake fluid.  DOT-3 fluids have the lowest\n    wet and dry boiling point _requirements_; DOT-4 fluids have better\n    boiling point requirements; and DOT-5 fluids have the best boiling\n    point requirements (but DOT-5 fluids are not clearly superior; see\n    the next Q&A for more details.)  While the requirements imply that\n    DOT-4 fluids are better than DOT-3 fluids, there may be specific\n    cases where a DOT-3 fluid is preferable, but these are mostly\n    competition applications.  Otherwise, DOT-4 type fluids offer _much_\n    improved brake pedal feel.  Replacement once a year is recommended for\n    DOT-4 fluids, although agressive drivers may profit by changing out\n    fluid more frequently, or at least bleeding a modest amount of fluid\n    out of the brake calipers fairly regularly.\n\nQ:  What about DOT-5 brake fluids?\n\nA:  This breaks down in to two parts.  The DOT-5 specification looks\n    excellent for performance, but the first DOT-5 fluids were Silicone\n    based.  Silicone fluids are a tricky proposition.  Unlike DOT-3 and\n    DOT-4 fluids, they do not absorb water at all.  While this may sound\n    like a feature, the problem is that any water present pools up in\n    such systems, interfering with braking performance and corroding any\n    metals at the spot where the pooling is occuring.  The water will tend\n    to migrate downwards in the braking system to the brake calipers, where\n    most of the corrosion occurs.\n\n    Because of this phenomenon, it is essential when converting to\n    Silicone to empty the entire brake system and flush it throughly\n    beforehand; some even recommend replacing all rubber parts in the\n    brake system when converting to Silicone fluids.\n\n    Two other issues that come up with silicone fluids:  1) they are\n    difficult to pour cleanly (that is, without air bubbles), which\n    interferes with getting a good brake pedal feel, and 2) while they\n    generally have much higher boiling points than DOT-4 fluids, they\n    do have high temperature failure modes which are indistinguishable\n    in effect from boiling DOT-4 fluids.  SIlicone fluids may make sense\n    in some street car applications, but they are certainly not\n    recommended for high performance driving applications, and the\n    economics are questionable for street use.\n\n    I have recently become aware of new fluids that meet the DOT-5 standard\n    that do not contain Silicones; these fluids appear to be reasonably\n    compatible with the older DOT-3 and DOT-4 fluids, but I have little\n    information at this time.\n\nQ:  ABS is available on some of the cars I'm looking at, but it costs\n    more.  Is it worth it?\n\nA:  This does not have a cut and dried answer; therefore, this answer will\n    be quite long in order to cover the pros and cons.  The short answer\n    is that ABS costs more, both initially, and to maintain, will generally\n    work better for the `average driver' (that is to say, a driver who does\n    not have extensive experience in high performance driving techniques),\n    and may require the `unlearning' of some obsolete braking techniques\n    like pump braking which should be unlearned in any case.\n\n    Now for the long answer.  ABS works by monitering the wheels of the\n    car, looking for signs of locked brakes.  It may or may not be able\n    be able to distinguish between the different wheels (there are several\n    systems on the market.)  It cannot detect impending lockup (which is\n    what you would really want in an ideal world), but only the existence\n    of lockup.  The sensors used vary; some of the less well designed\n    sensors are sensitive to tire size, and to brake pad material, and\n    may cease to function properly if the owner deviates from original\n    equipment or OE-equivalent components.\n\n    When the sensors detect lockup, the ABS system responds by unlocking\n    the brakes (either individually, or all at once, depending on the\n    system.)  If the driver keeps their foot firmly planted, the ABS\n    will end up cycling between the locked and unlocked states (if a\n    sensor existed that could detect _impending lockup_, then we could\n    sit right at that point, which is where maximum braking effect is\n    achieved.)  This pulsing can often be felt in the brake pedal, as\n    the system cycles.  The percentage of the time that the brakes are\n    truly engaged is called the `duty cycle'; typically in an ABS system\n    this is about 40%  On dry pavement, a trained driver can beat this\n    duty cycle quite reliably using a technique called threshold braking;\n    on wet pavement, braking is so chancy that ABS will outperform\n    threshold braking nearly every time.  Unfortunately, on mud and on\n    snow, often maximum braking effect can be acheived with the brakes\n    locked; only Audi, of the manufacturers producing ABS-equipped cars,\n    has seen fit to provide a disable switch for the ABS system for this\n    eventuality.\n\n    A particularly important feature of ABS is that it preserves\n    steering control.  This is the case simply because, if you are\n    braking near the limit and turn the wheel, the ABS will release\n    the brakes if it sees steering-triggered lockup, and back off\n    on the percentage of the time that the brakes are applied.\n    Braking distances will lengthen accordingly.\n\n    An important caution:  ABS cannot exceed the maximum theoretical\n    braking force in any given situation; if you start sliding on\n    glare ice, don't expect an ABS system to help you out very much.\n    The coefficient of friction is not changed by the presence of an\n    ABS system in your car.\n\n    As far as maintenence goes, in addition to the potential\n    restrictions I've listed above, you have to worry about the\n    following:  1) parts costs are much higher; the OE master cylinder\n    for my obscure european sedan lists for $185, but the OE master\n    cylinder for the ABS-equipped version of the same car lists for\n    over $1000.  Most manufacturers explicitly forbid use of DOT-5\n    (silicone) brake fluids in ABS-equipped vehicles.  Because of\n    the potential cost of replacement of corroded brake system\n    components, regular (I suggest annual) replacement of brake fluid\n    becomes very important.\n\nQ:  What about this threshold braking business?\n\nA:  [normally, I'd not put this in the consumers Q&A, but recent\n    publicity about a number of accidents involving police drivers\n    in ABS-equipped Chevy Caprices suggests that this section is\n    needed here -- rpw]\n\n    Threshold braking is a technique practiced by all serious high\n    performance drivers; if made a habit, it replaces the `stab\n    the pedal and lock 'em up' panic habit entirely, and is much\n    to be prefered.  Basically, the premise is that tires generate\n    maximum braking force when they have just started to slide, but\n    just before the wheels lock up entirely.  Drivers who threshold\n    brake learn to feel what this `threshold' feels like, and learn\n    to search for it and hit it on the application of the brake\n    pedal.  In many cars, you can feel that you are near the\n    threshold when the pedal starts to firm up as you depress it.\n    In any case, if you can't hear the tires whine just a bit, you're\n    not very near the threshold.\n\n    In a car with ABS, often there is a twinge in the pedal just\n    before the system starts cycling; if the driver backs off on\n    the pedal just a tad when the twinge is felt, then they are very\n    close to the threshold and they'll probably achieve better\n    stopping distances than if they just punched it and let the ABS\n    take over.\n\n    Recently, there has been a rash of publicity over a number of\n    accidents, and one death, involving police cars equipped with\n    ABS systems.  The police departments in question quickly blamed\n    the new ABS systems, but according to Autoweek magazine, it now\n    seems clear that the problem was a lack of training; none of the\n    involved officers had any recent performance driving training.\n    There is reason to believe that the drivers reacted to the pulsing\n    brake pedal by `pump braking', an old and discredited technique\n    of stabbing and releasing the brake pedal, the goal being to\n    try and get brakes back with a failing hydraulic system.  If you\n    think about it for a minute, you'll realize that pump braking must\n    cut the effective operation of a working brake system by at least\n    1/2, so if you cut the 40% duty cycle of an ABS system by that\n    much, you are giving up most of your brakes for the wrong reason.\n    Threshold braking has the advantage in that it is an effective\n    and useful technique regardless of whether your car has ABS; if\n    you do fear a failed hydraulic system, then one or two stabs at\n    the pedal will be sufficient.    \n\nGas Questions:\n\nQ:  Does High Octane gasoline help?\n\nA:  Maybe, maybe not.  Some cars have knock sensors, and can adjust the\n    engine timing or turbocharger boost to suit the gasoline being used.\n    On most cars, however, you should use the cheapest gas that makes your\n    car run well.  Check your owner's manual for details on what your car\n    needs.\n\nQ:  My car was made for leaded gasoline.  Will unleaded gas hurt it?\n\nA:  It is possible that unleaded gas may *slightly* increase valve wear,\n    although the Amoco Oil company argues otherwise.  The actual increase\n    in valve wear will be almost unnoticeable, however, as modern leaded\n    gasolines actually contain very little lead.  You should, however,\n    check your owner's manual; many cars from the early 1970s do not\n    actually require leaded gasoline.\n\nQ:  Do fuel treatments help?  What kind should I use?\n\nA:  Some do and some don't.  During the winter, it is a good idea to use\n    dry gas; however, some may be harmful to fuel injection systems.\n    Never use an additive containing Methanol (sometimes called Methyl\n    Alcohol); such additives may damage fuel systems in cars with carbs\n    and almost certainly will damage cars with fuel injection.\n\n    Manufacturer's opinions vary on additives containing Ethanol (sometimes\n    called Ethyl Alcohol); if your car has fuel injection, check the owner's\n    manual on your car before  using these.  Most manufacturers consider\n    10% Ethanol acceptable in gasoline.  Additives with Isopropyl Alcohol\n    (Isopropanol), and Petroleum  Distillates are fine in fuel injected\n    cars.\n\n    An occasional bottle of fuel injector cleaner is helpful in cars with\n    fuel injectors, although many premium gasolines contain detergents that\n    do the same job.  Some off brands of fuel injector cleaners contain\n    Ethanol or Methanol; always check the ingredients before putting anything\n    in your gas tank.\n\n    There are a small number of particularly good additives; these are\n    noticeably more expensive that the run-of-the-mill ones, but work\n    much, much better.  Among these are Chevron Techron, Redline SL-1,\n    Wurth `Lubrimoly Ventil Sauber', and BG 44K.  A bottle of one of these,\n    once every six months, is highly recommended.\n\nQ:  What about detergent gasolines?\n\nA:  The quality of detergent packages in gasolines varies somewhat; BMW\n    has instituted a testing program, and gasoline brands which pass this\n    test may advertise that fact.  Stickers indicating passage of the test\n    are now beginning to appear on fuel pumps at gas stations.  If such\n    gasolines are used, then fuel injector cleaners are probably optional.\n    Beforewarned that while use of BMW approved gasolines will keep a clean\n    engine clean, they may not clean a motor with bad valve deposits.\n\nLubrication Questions:\n\nQ:  What do the numbers and letters in a motor oil designation mean?\n\nA:  There are several different items encoded.  There is a two-letter\n    code indicating the type of detergent package that the manufacturer\t\n    uses in the oil; this looks like SE,SF,CD or such.  The S codes are\n    for gasoline engine applications; the C codes are for diesel engine\n    applications.  The second letter is assigned in sequence as new levels\n    of protection are developed; thus SF is considered better than SE,\n    SE is considered better than SD, and so forth.\n\n    The more noticeable designation is the oil weight.  This is either\n    a single number (e.g., 30 weight) or a pair of numbers separated by\n    the letter W (e.g., 10W30.)  The latter type is much more commonly\n    used these days, and are the only type that most automobile\n    manufacturers specify in operators manuals.  The first number in the\n    designation (10W) is the apparent viscosity of the oil when it is cold;\n    the W stands for `winter'.  The second number (30) is the viscosity\n    of the oil when hot.  There is a trick here; the oil doesn't actually\n    get thicker (turn from 10 weight to 30 weight) as it gets hotter.  What\n    is actually happening is that when the oil is cold, it has the viscosity\n    of a cold 10 weight oil.  as it gets hotter, it doesn't get thin as fast\n    as a 10W oil would; by the time it is up to temperature, it has the\n    viscosity of a hot 30 weight oil.\n\n    Note that these numbers actually specify ranges of viscosities; not\n    all 10W oils have exactly the same viscosity when cold, and not all\n    30 weight oils have the same viscosity when hot.  Note also that the\n    novel behaviour of multi-grade oils is caused by additives, and it has\n    been reported that with the sole exception of Castrol GTX, 10W40 oils\n    do not retain their multi-grade characteristics well over time.  10W30,\n    15W40, and 20W50 oils work very well, though.\n\nQ:  Are `quick lube' places any good?\n\nA:  Some do adequate work, but there are quite a few incompetent ones out\n    there.  Let the buyer beware, watch them while they work, make sure\n    that they don't overtorque the oil drain plug, and keep your hand on\n    your wallet at all times.\n\nQ:  Are oil additives like Slick-50 or Tufoil any good?\n\nA:  Slick-50 and Tufoil are PTFE-based additives.  Many of these have\n    come onto the market recently; they are different from the moly-based\n    additives that have been around since the early 50's.  PTFE is the\n    chemical name for Teflon(TM), a trademark owned by DuPont. In general,\n    auto manufacturers do not recommend use of these products.  Most USENET\n    responses to questions on these additives are favorable (slight\n    increase of MPG after application, smoother revving) but long term\n    results (whether PTFE additives are effective after 5K miles) are\n    debatable.  Some manufacturers (such as Saab) claim that either the\n    product or the engine flush that preceeds application causes\n    deterioration of the oil seals and eventual leakage.  Some BMW owners\n    have reported death of valve seals shortly after the addition of\n    Slick 50 to their cars.  This writer has been cautioned by a Slick-50\n    Dealer (!) that Slick-50 should _not_ be used in Japanese motors, as\n    it may clog the oil return passages in the engine.  Otherwise, there are\n    no known reports of damage caused by PTFE additives.\n\n    On the other hand, there are satified Slick 50 customers in the world.\n\nQ:  Do synthetic oils really work?\n\nA:  Yes, but.  More specifically, most auto manufactuers accept synthetics,\n    but disagree with the extremely long oil change intervals claimed by\n    oil manufacturers.  Auto manufacturers recommend that you continue to\n    change oil at the intervals recommended in the owners manual for your\n    car.  Even if you decide to try the longer intervals, at least change\n    the oil filter at regular intervals, as synthetics get just as dirty\n    as conventional oils.\n\n    Synthetic gear lubricants for manual transmissions are another matter\n    entirely; Amsoil, Redline, and AGIP are very highly regarded and very\n    effective.  Mobil 1 synthetic gear lube gets mixed reviews, however.\n\nQ:  Manufacturers are specifying longer and longer oil change intervals.\n    How often should I change my oil?\n\nA:  It depends on how you drive.  If your car always (or nearly always)\n    gets warmed up, and you don't drive it very hard and keep the revs\n    down, the manufacturer's recommendation is probably fine.  If, however,\n    you drive it hard, drive it at high revs, or alternatively, if you\n    only drive it to and from the supermarket so that it doesn't get up\n    to temperature, then you may wish to change oil much more often,\n    perhaps at 3000 mile intervals (given that most manufacturers are\n    now specifying 7500 mile intervals.)  If you don't drive your car\n    much at all (say 7500 miles a year), then you probably want to change\n    oil every six months anyway.  If you are storing a car during the winter,\n    then change oil before storing it and change oil when you bring it out\n    of storage.\n\nMisc. Questions:\n\nQ:  My car has a timing belt.  I hear that bad things happen when they\n    break.  What's the story?\n\nA:  It depends on the internal design of the motor.  Early Ford Escorts,\n    for example, will suffer severe valve damage if the belt breaks, but\n    the newer cars will just require a tow and installation of a new belt.\n    Some Honda motors will not be damaged, but others will be.\n\n    If no replacement interval is specified for your car, then change the\n    belt at least every 60,000 miles; some cars may require more frequent\n    replacement.  Ask your dealer or independent mechanic.  Also, ask if\n    there are any related repairs that should take place at the same time\n    (for example, the same Ford Escorts that suffer valve damage also have\n    a timing belt driven water pump, which has been known to seize,\n    destroying the timing belt, and which then causes major valve damage\n    as a side effect.  Replacing the timing belt while ignoring the water\n    pump can be a costly mistake.)\n\nQ:  Why would anyone be stupid enough to design a motor so that it\n    self destructs when the timing belt breaks?\n\nA:  For performance reasons.  Compromising piston design so that the\n    valves and pistons will not collide requires that the compression\n    ratio of the engine be reduced significantly; this is why you are\n    more likely to avoid valve damage in economy cars than in performance\n    oriented vehicles.\n\nQ:  What causes Unintended Acceleration?\n\nA:  The final report of the National Highway, Transportation, and Safety\n    Administration concluded that unintended acceleration could not be\n    caused by any mechanical failure of the vehicle in question and at the\n    same time be consistent with the physical evidence.  The NHTSA report\n    goes on to conclude that `pedal misapplication' by the vehicle operator\n    is probably the cause.","label":"rec.autos"}

This is due to the protocal the takes place between the two drives \nwhen performing diagnostics.\n   There are four links, LK1, LK2, LK4 and LK5, adjacent to the 40 way \ninterface connector. They have the following functions and are described \nin order as viewed from the end of the drive, with the first jumper \ndescribed nearest the 40 way interface connector.\n\nLK2: LED \n     When fitted, this jumper connects the LED drive to pin 39 of the\n     interface. This allows a LED to be connected to the interface. An\n     external current limiting resistor needs to be fitted in series with\n     the LED when this option is selected. The value of the resistor will\n     be dependant on the LED type chosen but will be in the range of 130\n     Ohms ot 220 Ohms.\n\nLK1: Dual Drives\n     This jumper must be fitted when two drives are attached to a single\n     bus. It fallows communication across the 40 way interface connector,\n     indicating, to the Master drive, the presence of a Slave.\n\nLK4: Master\n     When fitted this signifies that the drive jumpered is a Master. If\n     there are two drives connected on a single bus then only one may be\n     jumpered in this way.\n\nLK5: IOChRdy\n     When fitted this connects the IOChRdy signal to the drive, it is \n     fitted when the drive is used in host systems that have a higher\n     data transfer rate than the drive i.e. greater than 4 MBytes per\n     second when using 1:1 interleave. This jumper is not normally \n     fitted as most hosts transfer at a lower rate than 4 MBytes per\n     second.\n\n   There are four possible Master/Slave configurations in which a drive(s)\nmay be jumpered:\n\n     Master, single drive with LED on interface\t\tLK2 & LK4 fitted.\n     Master, single drive without LED on interface\tLK4 only fitted.\n     Master, dual drive without LED on interface\tLK4 & LK1 fitted.\n     Slave, dual drive without LED on interface\t\tNo jumpers fitted.\n     Master, dual drive with LED on interface\t\tLK4, LK1 & LK2 fitted.\n     Slave, dual drive with LED on interface\t\tLK2 only fitted.\n\n   The Master drive will delay power-up for approximately two seconds to\nreduce power surges in applications where dual drives are used.\n\n   The other connections for a LED will be found close to the 28 way \nconnector at the other end of the drive. This LED driver is not affected\nby the link options. An internal current limiting resistor is on the \ndrive for this LED driver. Refer to the product specification for further\ndetails.\n\n\n\n\n***************************   S E A G A T E   *************************\n\nThere is a list of most Seagate HD (including MFM, SCSI, ESDIand IDE) on\nevery Simtel mirror under\n\n/msdos/dskutl/1seagate.zip\n\nIt contains info about the following drives:\n\n\t    st1144a\tst138a\t    st274a\tst3283a\nst1057a     st1156a\tst1400a     st280a\tst351ax\nst1090a     st1162a\tst1401a     st3051a\tst9051a\nst1102a     st1186a\tst1480a     st3096a\tst9077a\nst1111a     st1201a\tst157a\t    st3120a\tst9096a\nst1126a     st1239a\tst2274a     st3144a\tst9144a\nst1133a     st125a\tst2383a     st325ax\n\n\n*********************\tT E A C   **************\n\nModel: SD-3105\n\n                Cyls.

{"text":"Classify the following data: Joe,\n\n     As usual, this issue of dysfunction, of bad values, of messed up culture \nis easily embraced by non african americans when it comes to explaining\nproblems in our community. From your post, you apparently find the idea that\nsomething is wrong with African Americans, value-wise, culture wise or\nsomething, very appealing. I never cease to be amazed at how eager non african\namericans are to embrace theories about our problems which basically assert\nthat something is wrong with us. The socio-economic factors which we know help \nto produce high crime levels, like poverty, which exists among us in large \nproportion, I mean when it comes to discussion of african american problems, we\nsomehow become exempt from all these types of factors, and the problem is \nlaid at the doorstep of some neboulous dysfunction we supposedly have. But \nnobody attributes crime amongst white americans to dysfunction. No, that has \nsocioeconomic factors to it, but for africa americans, its gotta be a \ndysfunction.\n\nBasically, I think this tendency for non african americans to believe that\nsomething is wrong with us exists because non african americans don't want to\ndeal with the possiblility that the society is deeply biased against african\namericans, and that this is about 80% of the problem. It could not possible be\nthat the society is so deeply racist and structured against us, that this has\na very effective negative effect on us. No, something is wrong with us.\nNon african americans are quick to disregard what we have to say, because they \nare so busy trying to find something wrong with us, instead of taking a good \nhard look at the thing we say are doing us damage. I would get angry if it \nwerent' so damn typical.","label":"talk.politics.misc"}

What then can they make of the end of Matthew?\n\n(28:18)And Jesus came and said to them, \"All authority in heaven and on\nearth has been given to me. (19)Go therefore and make disciples of all\nnations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and\nof the Holy Spirit, (20) and teaching them to obey everything that I\nhave commanded to you.  And remember, I am with you always, to the end\nof the age.\" {Other ancient authorities add *Amen*} [NRSV]\n\nThe notes give no sense that this is emended.  Do other texts\ncontradict this regarding Baptism?  Or is a misunderstanding of the\nTrinity the most likely explanation after all?\n\nBut maybe I simply misunderstand their views.  (Is anyone else out there\nforced to read this group with both a good Bible and an unabridged\ndictionary??  Christianity really is an education in itself.)\n\n--\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n[Arrgggghhhh.  When I talked about people who rejected Trinitarian\nlanguage as unBiblical, I was speaking of Trinitarian theology, things\nlike \"one essense and three persons\".  Obviously the three-fold\nbaptismal formula is Biblical, as you point out.  (I normally use the\nterm \"three-fold\" in referring to Mat.  While it is certainly\nconsistent with belief in the Trinity, the Trinity is a doctrine whose\nfull formulation occurred in the 4th and 5th Cent's.  It's unlikely\nthat Mat. had in mind the fully-developed Trinitarian doctrine.\nIndeed the three-fold baptismal formula is used by some groups that do\nnot believe in the Trinity.)  The disagreement over baptismal formulae\noccurs because of passages such as Acts 2:38, which command baptism in\nthe name of Jesus.  (There are a couple of other passages in Acts as\nwell.)  This leaves us with sort of a problem: we're commanded in Mat.\nto baptize in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit,\nand in Acts to baptize in the name of Jesus.\n\n\"Jesus only\" groups baptize in the name of Jesus.  They consider this\nconsistent with Mat 28:18, because they say that Jesus is the name of\nthe Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.  I'm not the right one to\nask to explain what this means.  I will simply say that it does not\nappear to be normal Trinitarian theology.  (It is also an odd way of\ndealing with the idiomatic phrase \"in the name of\".)\n\nThose who use the three-fold formula don't seem to have a standard\nanswer to the passages talking about baptizing in the name of Jesus.\nI suspect that the most common explanation is to say that \"in the name\nof\" need not be a verbal formula.  To say that you baptize in the name\nof Jesus may simply mean that you are doing baptism under Jesus'\nauthority.  In the 1st Cent. context, it contrasts Christian baptism\nwith the baptism of John or other Jewish baptism.  Of course there's a\ncertain parallelism between these passages.  That suggests that we\ncould just as well say that Mat 28:18 doesn't require the specific\nthree-fold formula to be used in baptism, but simply characterizes\nbaptism done by those who follow the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.\n\nOne might well suspect that in the early church, more than one\nbaptismal formula was used.  So long as we consider following Jesus to\nbe the same as following the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, no great\ndamage would be done by such a difference.  This does *not* mean that\nI think we should go back to using both formulae.  Baptism is one of\nthe few things that almost all Christian groups now recognize\nmutually, so I do not think doing something to upset that would be in\nthe interests of the Gospel.  This is reinforced by the fact that\nthose groups that actually use \"in the name of Jesus\" now do seem to\nhave in mind a difference in doctrine.  But as I've said before, I'm\nnot the one to explain what their doctrine is.","label":"soc.religion.christian"}

Spoofing a keyboard over the serial port\n        2. X terminals\n        3. NeXT\n        4. Silicon Graphics\n        5. IBM RS/6000\n\t6. Other stuff\n\n    1. Spoofing a keyboard over the serial port\n\n\tIf you've got a proprietary computer which uses its own keyboard\n\t(Sun, HP, DEC, etc.) then you're going to have a hard time finding\n\ta vendor to sell you a compatible keyboard.  If your workstation\n\truns the X window system, you're in luck.  You can buy a cheap used\n\tPC, hook your expensive keyboard up to it, and run a serial cable\n\tto your workstation.  Then, run a program on the workstation to read\n\tthe serial port and generate fake X keyboard events.\n\n\tThe two main programs I've found to do this are KT and A2X.\n\n\ta2x is a sophisticated program, capable of controlling the mouse, and\n\teven moving among widgets on the screen.  It requires a server\n\textension (XTEST, DEC-XTRAP, or XTestExtension1).  To find out if your\n\tserver can do this, run 'xdpyinfo' and see if any of these strings\n\tappear in the extensions list.  If your server doesn't have this,\n\tyou may want to investigate compiling X11R5, patchlevel 18 or later,\n\tor bugging your vendor.\n\n\tkt is a simpler program, which should work with unextended X servers.\n\tAnother program called xsendevent also exists, but I haven't seen it.\n\n\tBoth a2x and kt are available via anonymous ftp from soda.berkeley.edu.\n\n    2. X terminals\n\n\tAlso, a number of X terminals (NCD, Tektronics, to name a few) use\n\tPC-compatible keyboards.  If you have an X terminal, you may be all\n\tset.  Try it out with a normal PC keyboard before you go through the\n\ttrouble of buying an alternative keyboard.  Also, some X terminals add\n\textra buttons -- you may need to keep your original keyboard around\n\tfor the once-in-a-blue-moon that you have to hit the Setup key.\n\n    3. NeXT\n\n\tNeXT had announced that new NeXT machines will use the Apple Desktop\n\tBus, meaning any Mac keyboard will work.  Then, they announced they\n\twere cancelling their hardware production.  If you want any kind of\n\tupgrade for an older NeXT, do it now!\n\n    4. Silicon Graphics\n\n\tSilicon Graphics has announced that their newer machines (Indigo^2 and\n\tbeyond) will use standard PC-compatible keyboards and mice.  I don't\n\tbelieve this also applies to the Power Series machines.  It's not\n\tpossible to upgrade an older SGI to use PC keyboards, except by\n\tupgrading the entire machine.  Contact your SGI sales rep for more\n\tdetails.\n\n    5. IBM RS/6000\n\n\tIBM RS/6000 keyboards are actually similar to normal PC keyboards.  ||\n\tUnfortunately, you can't just plug one in.  You need two things: a  ||\n\tcable converter to go from the large PC keyboard connector to the   ||\n\tsmaller PS/2 style DIN-6, and a new device driver for AIX.  Believe ||\n\tit or not, IBM wrote this device driver recently, I used it, and it ||\n\tworks.  However, they don't want me to redistribute it.  I've been  ||\n\ttold Judy Hume (512) 823-6337 is a potential contact.  If you learn ||\n\tanything new, please send me e-mail.\t\t\t\t    ||\n    \n    6. Other stuff\n\n\tSome vendors here (notably: Health Care Keyboard Co. and AccuCorp)\n\tsupport some odd keyboard types, and may be responsive to your\n\tqueries regarding supporting your own weird computer.  If you can\n\tget sufficient documention about how your keyboard works (either\n\tfrom the vendor, or with a storage oscilloscope), you may be in\n\tluck.  Contact the companies for more details.\n\n\nApple Adjustable Keyboard\n    Apple Computer, Inc.\n    Sales offices all over the place.\n\n    Availability: February, 1993\n    Price: $219\n    Supports: Mac only\n\n    Apple has recently announced their new split-design keyboard.  The\n    keyboard has one section for each hand, and the sections rotate\n    backward on a hinge.  The sections do not tilt upward.  The keys are\n    arranged in a normal QWERTY fashion.\n\n    The main foldable keyboard resembles a normal Apple Keyboard.\n    A separate keypad contains all the extended key functions.\n\n    The keyboard also comes with matching wrist rests, which are not\n    directly attachable to the keyboard.\n\n    As soon as soda comes back up, I'll have a detailed blurb from\n    TidBITS available there.\n\n\nFlexPro Keyboard\n    Key Tronic\n    Phone: 800-262-6006\n    Possible contact: Denise Razzeto, 509-927-5299\n    Sold by many clone vendors and PC shops\n\n    Availability: Spring, 1993 (?)\n    Price: $489 (?)\n    Supports: PC only (highly likely)\n\n    Keytronic apparently showed a prototype keyboard at Comdex.  It's\n    another split-design.  One thumb-wheel controls the tilt of both\n    the left and right-hand sides of the main alphanumeric section.\n    The arrow keys and keypad resemble a normal 101-key PC keyboard.\n\n    Keytronic makes standard PC keyboards, also, so this product will\n    probably be sold through their standard distribution channels.\n\n\nDragonDictate-30K (and numerous other Dragon products)\n    Dragon Systems, Inc.\n    320 Nevada Street\n    Newton, MA  02160\n\n    Phone: 800-TALK-TYP or 617-965-5200\n    Fax: 617-527-0372\n\n    Shipping: Now.\n\n    Price: DragonDictate-30K -- $4995 (end user system)\n\t   DragonWriter 1000 -- $1595 / $2495 (end user/developer system)\n\t   various other prices for service contracts, site licenses, etc.\n    \n    Compatibility: 386 (or higher) PC only\n\t\t   (3rd party support for Mac)\n\n\tFree software support for X windows is also available -- your\n\tPC with Dragon hardware talks to your workstation over a\n\tserial cable or network.

{"text":"Classify the following data: I can not believe the way this thread on candida(yeast) has progressed.\nSteve Dyer and I have been exchanging words over the same topic in Sci. \nMed. Nutrition when he displayed his typical reserve and attacked a women \nposter for being treated by a liscenced physician for a disease that did \nnot exist.  Calling this physician a quack was reprehensible Steve and I \nsee that you and some of the others are doing it here as well.  \n\nLet me tell you who the quacks really are, these are the physicans who have \nno idea how the human body interacts with it's environment and how that \nbalance can be altered by diet and antibiotics.  These are the physicians \nwho dismiss their patients with difficult symptomatology and make them go \nfrom doctor to doctor to find relief(like Elaine in Sci. Med. Nutrition) and \nthen when they find one that solves their problem, the rest start yelling \nquack.  Could it just be professional jealousy?  I couldn't help Elaine or Jon\nbut somebody else did.  Could they know more than Me?  No way, they must be a \nquack.  \n\nI've been teaching a human nutrition course for Medical students for over ten \nyears now and guess who the most receptive students are?  Those that were \nraised on farms and saw first-hand the effect of diet on the health of their \nfarm animals and those students who had made a dramatic diet change prior to \nentering medical school(switched to the vegan diet).  Typically, this is \nabout 1/3 of my class of 90 students.  Those not interested in nutrition \neither tune me out or just stop coming to class.  That's okay because I \nknow that some of what I'm teaching is going to stick and there will be at \nleast a few \"enlightened\" physicians practicing in the U.S.  It's really \ntoo bad that most U.S. medical schools don't cover nutrition because if \nthey did, candida would not be viewed as a non-disease by so many in the \nmedical profession.\n\nIn animal husbandry, an animal is reinnoculated with \"good\" bacteria after \nantibiotics are stopped.  Medicine has decided that since humans do not \nhave a ruminant stomach, no such reinnoculation with \"good\" bacteria is \nneeded after coming off a braod spectrum antibiotic.  Humans have all \nkinds of different organisms living in the GI system(mouth, stomach, small \nand large intestine), sinuses, vagina and on the skin.  These are \nnonpathogenic because they do not cause disease in people unless the immune \nsystem is compromised.  They are also called nonpathogens because unlike \nthe pathogenic organisms that cause human disease, they do not produce \ntoxins as they live out their merry existence in and on our body.  But any of \nthese organisms will be considered pathogenic if it manages to take up \nresidence within the body.  A poor mucus membrane barrier can let this \nhappen and vitamin A is mainly responsible for setting up this barrier.\nSteve got real upset with Elaine's doctor because he was using anti-fungals \nand vitamin A for her GI problems.  If Steve really understoood what \nvitamin A does in the body, he would not(or at least should not) be calling \nElaine's doctor a quack.\n\nHere is a brief primer on yeast.  Yeast infections, as they are commonly \ncalled, are not truely caused by yeasts.  The most common organism responsible\nfor this type of infection is Candida albicans or Monilia which is actually a \nyeast-like fungus.  An infection caused by this organism is called candidiasis.\nCandidiasis is a very rare occurance because, like an E. Coli infection, it \nrequires that the host immune system be severly depressed.  \n\nCandida is frequently found on the skin and all of the mucous membranes of \nnormal healthy people and it rarely becomes a problem unless some predisposing\nfactor is present such as a high blood glucose level(diabetes) or an oral \ncourse of antibiotics has been used.  In diabetics, their secretions contain \nmuch higher amounts of glucose.  Candida, unlike bacteria, is very limited in \nit's food(fuel) selection.  Without glucose, it can not grow, it just barely \nsurvives.  If it gets access to a lot of glucose, it blooms and over rides \nthe other organisms living with it in the sinuses, GI tract or vagina.  In \ndiabetics, skin lesions can also foster a good bloom site for these little \nbuggers.  The bloom is usually just a minor irritant in most people but \nsome people do really develop a bad inflammatory process at the mucus \nmembrane or skin bloom site.  Whether this is an allergic like reaction to \nthe candida or not isn't certain.  When the bloom is in the vagina or on \nthe skin, it can be easliy seen and some doctors do then try to \"treat\" it.\nIf it's internal, only symptoms can be used and these symptoms are pretty \nnondiscript.  \n\n\nCandida is kept in check in most people by the normal bacterial flora in \nthe sinuses, the GI tract(mouth, stomach and intestines) and in the \nvaginal tract which compete with it for food.  The human immune system \nususally does not bother itself with these(nonpathogenic organisms) unless \nthey broach the mucus membrane \"barrier\".  If they do, an inflammatory \nresponse will be set up.  Most Americans are not getting enough vitamin A \nfrom their diets.  About 30% of all American's die with less Vitamin A than \nthey were born with(U.S. autopsy studies).  While this low level of vitamin \nA does not cause pathology(blindness) it does impair the mucus membrane \nbarrier system.  This would then be a predisposing factor for a strong \ninflammatory response after a candida bloom.  \n\nWhile diabetics can suffer from a candida \"bloom\" the  most common cause of \nthis type of bloom is the use of broad spectrum antibiotics which \nknock down many different kinds of bacteria in the body and remove the main \ncompetition for candida as far as food is concerned.  While drugs are \navailable to handle candida, many patients find that their doctor will not \nuse them unless there is evidence of a systemic infection.  The toxicity of \nthe anti-fungal drugs does warrant some caution.  But if the GI or sinus \ninflammation is suspected to be candida(and recent use of a broad spectrum \nantibiotic is the smoking gun), then anti-fungal use should be approrpriate \njust as the anti-fungal creams are an appropriate treatment for recurring \nvaginal yeast infections, in spite of what Mr. Steve Dyer says.\n\nBut even in patients being given the anti-fungals, the irritation caused by \nthe excessive candida bloom in the sinus, GI tract or the vagina tends to \nreturn after drug treatment is discontinued unless the underlying cause of \nthe problem is addressed(lack of a \"good\" bacterial flora in the body and/or \npoor mucus membrane barrier).  Lactobacillus acidophilus is the most effective \ntherapy for candida overgrowth.  From it's name, it is an acid loving \norganism and it sets up an acidic condition were it grows.  Candida can not \ngrow very well in an acidic environment.  In the vagina, L. acidophilius is \nthe predominate bacteria(unless you are hit with broad spectrum \nantibiotics).  \n\nIn the GI system, the ano-rectal region seems to be a particularly good \nreservoir for candida and the use of pantyhose by many women creates a very \nfavorable environment around the rectum for transfer(through moisture and \nhumidity) of candida to the vaginal tract.  One of the most effctive ways to \nminimmize this transfer is to wear undyed cotton underwear.  \n\nIf the bloom occurs in the anal area, the burning, swelling, pain and even \nblood discharge make many patients think that they have hemorroids.  If the \nbloom manages to move further up the GI tract, very diffuse symptomatology \noccurs(abdominal discomfort and blood in the stool).  This positive stool \nfor occult blood is what sent Elaine to her family doctor in the first \nplace.  After extensive testing, he told her that there was nothing wrong \nbut her gut still hurt.  On to another doctor, and so on.  Richard Kaplan \nhas told me throiugh e-mail that he considers occult blood tests in stool \nspecimens to be a waste of time and money because of the very large number of \nfalse positives(candida blooms guys?).  If my gut hurt me on a constant \nbasis, I would want it fixed.  Yes it's nice to know that I don't have \ncolon cancer but what then is causing my distress?  When I finally find a \ndoctor who treats me and gets me 90% better, Steve Dyer calls him a quack.\n\nCandida prefers a slightly alkaline environment while bacteria \ntend to prefer a slightly acidic environment.  The vagina becomes alkaline \nduring a woman's period and this is often when candida blooms in the vagina. \nVinegar and water douches are the best way of dealing with vaginal \nproblems.  Many women have also gotten relief from the introduction of \nLactobacillus directly into the vaginal tract(I would want to be sure of \nthe purity of the product before trying this).  My wife had this vagina \nproblem after going on birth control pills and searched for over a year \nuntil she found a gynocologist who solved the problem rather than just writting \nscripts for anti-fungal creams.  This was a woman gynocologist who had had \nthe same problem(recurring vaginal yeast infections).  This M.D. did some \ndigging and came up with an acetic acid and L. Acidophilis douche which she \nused in your office to keep it sterile.  After three treatments, sex \nreturned to our marraige.  I have often wondered what an M.D. with chronic \nGI distress or sinus problems would do about the problem that he tells his \npatients is a non-existent syndrome.\n\nThe nonpathogenic bacteria L. acidophilus is an acid producing bacteria \nwhich is the most common bacteria found in the vaginal tract of healthy women.  \nIf taken orally, it can also become a major bacteria in the gut.  Through \naresol sprays, it has also been used to innoculate the sinus membranes.\nBut before this innoculation occurs, the mucus membrane barrier system \nneeds to be strengthened.  This is accomplished by vitamin A, vitamin C and \nsome of the B-complex vitamins.  Diet surveys repeatedly show that Americans \nare not getting enough B6 and folate.  These are probably the segement of \nthe population that will have the greatest problem with this non-existent \ndisorder(candida blooms after antibiotic therapy).\n \nSome of the above material was obtained from \"Natural Healing\" by Mark \nBricklin, Published by Rodale press, as well as notes from my human \nnutrition course.  I will be posting a discussion of vitamin A  sometime in \nthe future, along with reference citings to point out the extremely \nimportant role that vitamin A plays in the mucus membrane defense system in \nthe body and why vitamin A should be effective in dealing with candida \nblooms.  Another effective dietary treatment is to restrict carbohydrate \nintake during the treatment phase, this is especially important if the GI \nsystem is involved.  If candida can not get glucose, it's not going to out \ngrow the bacteria and you then give bacteria, which can use amino acids and \nfatty acids for energy, a chance to take over and keep the candida in check \nonce carbohydrate is returned to the gut.\n\nIf Steve and some of the other nay-sayers want to jump all over this post, \nfine.  I jumped all over Steve in Sci. Med. Nutrition because he verbably \naccosted a poster who was seeking advice about her doctor's use of vitamin \nA and anti-fungals for a candida bloom in her gut.  People seeking advice \nfrom newsnet should not be treated this way.  Those of us giving of our \ntime and knowledge can slug it out to our heart's content.  If you saved \nyour venom for me Steve and left the helpless posters who are timidly \nseeking help alone, I wouldn't have a problem with your behavior. \n \nMartin Banschbach, Ph.D.\nProfessor of Biochemistry and Chairman\nDepartment of Biochemistry and Microbiology\nOSU College of Osteopathic Medicine\n1111 West 17th St.\nTulsa, Ok. 74107","label":"sci.med"}

With these, \"high-thrust\"\n\t    interplanetary flight is not possible, because system\n\t    acceleration (a(t)) capabilities are always less than the local\n\t    gravitational acceleration. In contrast, gain values 50-100\n\t    times higher are found for some fusion concepts, which offer\n\t    \"high-thrust\" flight capability. One performance example shows a\n\t    53.3 day (34.4 powered; 18.9 coast), one-way transit time with\n\t    19% payload for a single-stage Earth/Mars vehicle. Another shows\n\t    the potential for high acceleration (a(t)=0.55g(o)) flight in\n\t    Earth/moon space.\n\n\t\"The QED Engine System: Direct Electric Fusion-Powered Systems for\n\tAerospace Flight Propulsion\" by Robert W.

Koloc, Eight ANS Topical Meeting on Technology of Fusion\n\tEnergy, special issue FUSION TECHNOLOGY, March 1989.\n\n\t    Aneutronic energy (fusion with little or negligible neutron\n\t    flux) requires plasma pressures and stable confinement times\n\t    larger than can be delivered by current approaches. If plasma\n\t    pressures appropriate to burn times on the order of milliseconds\n\t    could be achieved in aneutronic fuels, then high power densities\n\t    and very compact, realtively clean burning engines for space and\n\t    other special applications would be at hand. The PLASMAKtm\n\t    innovation will make this possible; its unique pressure\n\t    efficient structure, exceptional stability, fluid-mechanically\n\t    compressible Mantle and direct inductive MHD electric power\n\t    conversion advantages are described. Peak burn densities of tens\n\t    of megawats per cc give it compactness even in the\n\t    multi-gigawatt electric output size. Engineering advantages\n\t    indicate a rapid development schedule at very modest cost. [I\n\t    strongly recommend that people take this guy seriously. Bob\n\t    Hirsch, the primary proponent of the Tokamak, has recently\n\t    declared Koloc's PLASMAKtm precursor, the spheromak, to be one\n\t    of 3 promising fusion technologies that should be pursued rather\n\t    than Tokamak. Aside from the preceeding appeal to authority, the\n\t    PLASMAKtm looks like it finally models ball-lightning with solid\n\t    MHD physics. -- Jim Bowery]\n\n    ION DRIVES:\n\n\tRetrieve files pub/SPACE/SPACELINK/6.5.2.* from the Ames SPACE\n\tarchive; these deal with many aspects of ion drives and describe the\n\tSERT I and II missions, which flight-tested cesium ion thrusters in\n\tthe 1960s and 70s.

As soon as you possibly can.  The\ndifference of a day or two can mean the difference between a short recovery\nand a long, drawn-out ordeal.  GO SEE A DOCTOR.  Now, your garden-variety\ndoctor may not necessarily be familiar with this sort of injury.  Generally,\nany hospital with an occupational therapy clinic will offer specialists in\nthese kinds of problems.  DON'T WAIT, THOUGH.  GO SEE A DOCTOR.\n\nThe remainder of this information is paraphrased, without permission, from\na wonderful report by New Zealand's Department of Labour (Occupational\nSafety and Health Service): \"Occupational Overuse Syndrome. Treatment and\nRehabilitation: A Practitioner's Guide\".\n\nFirst, a glossary (or, fancy names for how you shouldn't have your hands):\n(note: you're likely to hear these terms from doctors and keyboard vendors :)\n\n  RSI: Repetitive Strain Injury - a general term for many kinds of injuries\n  OOS: Occupational Overuse Syndrome -- synonym for RSI\n  CTD: Cumulative Trauma Disorder -- another synonym for RSI\n  WRULD: Work-Related Upper Limb Disorders -- yet another synonym for RSI\n  CTS: Carpal Tunnel Syndrome (see below)\n  Hyperextension:  Marked bending at a joint.\n  Pronation: Turning the palm down.\n  Wrist extension: Bending the wrist up.\n  Supination: Turning the palm up.\n  Wrist flexion: Bending the wrist down.\n  Pinch grip: The grip used for a pencil.\n  Ulnar deviation: Bending the wrist towards the little finger.\n  Power grip: The grip used for a hammer.\n  Radial Deviation: Bending the wrist toward the thumb.\n  Abduction: Moving away from the body.\n  Overspanning: Opening the fingers out wide.\n\nNow then, problems come in two main types: Local conditions and diffuse\nconditions.  Local problems are what you'd expect: specific muscles,\ntendons, tendon sheaths, nerves, etc. being inflamed or otherwise hurt.\nDiffuse conditions, often mistaken for local problems, can involve muscle\ndiscomfort, pain, burning and/or tingling; with identifiable areas of\ntenderness in muscles, although they're not necessarily \"the problem.\"\n\n--- Why does Occupational Overuse Syndrome occur?  Here's the theory.\n\nNormally, your muscles and tendons get blood through capillaries which\npass among the muscle fibers.  When you tense a muscle, you restrict\nthe blood flow.  By the time you're exerting 50% of your full power,\nyou're completely restricting your blood flow.\n\nWithout fresh blood, your muscles use stored energy until they run out,\nthen they switch to anaerobic (without oxygen) metabolism, which generates\nnasty by-products like lactic acid, which cause pain.\n\nOnce one muscle hurts, all its neighbors tense up, perhaps to relieve the\nload.  This makes sense for your normal sort of injury, but it only makes\nthings worse with repetitive motion.  More tension means less blood flow,\nand the cycle continues.\n\nAnother by-product of the lack of blood flow is tingling and numbness from\nyour nerves.  They need blood too.\n\nAnyway, when you're typing too much, you're never really giving a change\nfor the blood to get back where it belongs, because your muscles never\nrelax enough to let the blood through.  Stress, poor posture, and poor\nergonomics, only make things worse.\n\n--- Specific injuries you may have heard of:\n\n(note: most injuries come in two flavors: acute and chronic.  Acute\ninjuries are severely painful and noticable.  Chronic conditions have\nless pronounced symptoms but are every bit as real.)\n\nTenosynovitis -- an inflamation of the tendon sheath.  Chronic tenosynovitis\noccurs when the repetitive activity is mild or intermittent: not enough to\ncause acute inflamation, but enough to exceed the tendon sheath's ability\nto lubricate the tendon.  As a result, the tendon sheath thickens, gets\ninflamed, and you've got your problem.\n\nTendonitis -- an inflammation of a tendon.  Repeated tensing of a tendon\ncan cause inflamation.  Eventually, the fibers of the tendon start separating,\nand can even break, leaving behind debris which induces more friction, more\nswelling, and more pain.  \"Sub-acute\" tendonitis is more common, which entails\na dull ache over the wrist and forearm, some tenderness, and it gets worse\nwith repetitive activity.\n\nCarpal Tunnel Syndrome -- the nerves that run through your wrist into your\nfingers get trapped by the inflamed muscles around them.  Symptoms include\nfeeling \"pins and needles\", tingling, numbness, and even loss of sensation.\nCTS is often confused for a diffuse condition.\n\nAdverse Mechanical Tension -- also known as 'neural tension', this is where\nthe nerves running down to your arm have become contracted and possibly\ncompressed as a result of muscle spasms in the shoulders and elsewhere.\nAMT can often misdiagnosed as or associated with one of the other OOS \ndisorders.  It is largely reversible and can be treated with physiotherapy \n(brachial plexus stretches and trigger point therapy).\n\nOthers: for just about every part of your body, there's a fancy name for\na way to injure it.  By now, you should be getting an idea of how OOS\nconditions occur and why.  Just be careful: many inexperienced doctors\nmisdiagnose problems as Carpal Tunnel Syndrome, when in reality, you\nmay have a completely different problem.  Always get a second opinion\nbefore somebody does something drastic to you (like surgery).\n\n==4== Typing posture, ergonomics, prevention, treatment\n\nThe most important element of both prevention and recovery is to reduce\ntension in the muscles and tendons.  This requires learning how to relax.\nIf you're under a load of stress, this is doubly important.  Tune out\nthe world and breath deep and regular.  Relaxing should become a guiding\nprinciple in your work: every three minutes take a three second break.\nEVERY THREE MINUTES, TAKE A THREE SECOND BREAK.  Really, do it every\nthree minutes.  It's also helpful to work in comfortable surroundings,\ncalm down, and relax.\n\nIf you can't sleep, you really need to focus on this.  Rest, sleep, and\nrelaxation are really a big deal.\n\nThere are all kinds of other treatments, of course.  Drugs can reduce\ninflamation and pain.  Custom-molded splints can forcefully prevent bad\nposture.  Surgery can fix some problems.  Exercise can help strengthen\nyour muscles.  Regular stretching can help prevent injury.  Good posture\nand a good ergonomic workspace promote reduced tension.  Ice or hot-cold\ncontrast baths also reduce swelling.  Only your doctor can say what's best\nfor you.\n\n--- Posture -- here are some basic guidelines.  [I so liked the way this was\nwritten in the New Zealand book that I'm lifting it almost verbatim from\nAppendix 10. -- dwallach]\n\n. Let your shoulders relax.\n. Let your elbows swing free.\n. Keep your wrists straight.\n. Pull your chin in to look down - don't flop your head forward.\n. Keep the hollow in the base of your spine.\n. Try leaning back in the chair.\n. Don't slouch or slump forward.\n. Alter your posture from time to time.\n. Every 20 minutes, get up and bend your spine backward.\n\nSet the seat height, first.  Your feet should be flat on the floor.  There \nshould be no undue pressure on the underside of your thighs near the knees,\nand your thighs should not slope too much.\n\nNow, draw yourself up to your desk and see that its height is comfortable\nto work at.  If you are short, this may be impossible.  The beest remedy\nis to raise the seat height and prevent your legs from dangling by using a\nfootrest.\n\nNow, adjust the backrest height so that your buttocks fit into the space\nbetween the backrest and the seat pan.  The backrest should support you in\nthe hollow of your back, so adjust its tilt to give firm support in this\narea.\n\nIf you operate a keyboard, you will be able to spend more time leaning\nback, so experiment with a chair with a taller backrest, if available.\n\n[Now, I diverge a little from the text]\n\nA good chair makes a big difference.  If you don't like your chair, go\nfind a better one.  You really want adjustments for height, back angle,\nback height, and maybe even seat tilt.  Most arm rests seem to get in\nthe way, although some more expensive chairs have height adjustable arm\nrests which you can also rotate out of the way.  You should find a good\nstore and play with all these chairs -- pick one that's right for you.\nIn the San Francisco Bay Area, I highly recommend \"Just Chairs.\"  The\nname says it all.\n\n--- Keyboard drawers, wrist pads, and keyboard replacements:\n\nThere is a fair amount of controvery on how to get this right.  For some\npeople, wrist pads seem to work wonders.  However, with good posture, you\nshouldn't be resting your wrists on anything -- you would prefer your\nkeyboard to be \"right there\".  If you drop your arms at your side and then\nlift your hands up at the elbow, you want your keyboard under your hands\nwhen your elbows are at about 90 degrees.  Of course, you want to avoid\npronation, wrist extension, and ulnar deviation at all costs.  Wrist pads\nmay or may not help at this.  You should get somebody else to come and\nlook at how you work: how you sit, how you type, and how you relax.  It's\noften easier for somebody else to notice your hunched shoulders or\ndeviated hands.\n\nSome argue that the normal, flat keyboard is antiquated and poorly\ndesigned.  A number of replacements are available, on the market, today.\nCheck out the accompanying typing-injury-faq/keyboards for much detail.\n\n==5== Requests for more info\n\nClearly, the above information is incomplete.  The typing-injury archive\nis incomplete.  There's always more information out there.  If you'd like\nto submit something, please send me mail, and I'll gladly throw it in.\n\nIf you'd like to maintain a list of products or vendors, that would be\nwonderful!

Everybody in the world looks\nand hopes for peace, so why isnot there any. hope of peace is necessary\nbut not sufficient motive.\n\n\n\nAs for the Arabian countries, their problems are an Arabian concern. \nthe Arabian people can deal with it themselves, if the west doesnot intervene.\nAs for Serbs, I donot think that those FUCKED UP RAPISTS (excuse my language\nbut it really hurts as much if I was in Bosnia itself) areNOT humans. Those\nsurely came from outer space or something. No human can allow himself\nto see such attrocities than to participate in.\n \n\nOk.\n\n\nMy definition is the same as yours, but one has to look into the world politics.\nIn politics, a \"solution\" doesNOT imply \"JUST solution\".\n\n\nIt seems that it was problem in the definition of \"solution\".\nI think a solution must be just, because otherwise it would never be lasting.\nHowever, when politicians say a solution, they donot mean a just solution but \njust a solution.\n\n","label":"talk.politics.mideast"}

I was just reading John 14 this morning (I think that is the\nright chapter, anyway it is close and I don't have a Bible at work to\ncheck with.) and in it Jesus is talking to his disciples about his\nimpending death and he says that he will be going away and then later\nhe will be with them.  He said something along the lines of \"I will\nbe in you and you will be in me.\"  (Again I cannot provide the exact\nquote or citation.)  Anyway, my understanding of this is that\nthe Second Coming will not be an outward event.  It is an inward\nevent, Christ will come to live in our hearts and we will live in him.\nIf you look for a person you will be deceived.\n\nIt seems to me that the Jews had been looking for a Messiah that would\nbe a political or military leader and so didn't recognize Jesus when\nhe came.

Is this correct?? If so, why the big time delay??\nI know all scripture is inspired of God, so the time of writing is I suppose\nun-important, but I still can't help be curious!\n\n---------------------------------------------------\nIvan Thomas Barr \n\nContact me at u9126619@athmail1.causeway.qub.ac.uk\n\n[The Gospels aren't dated, so we can only guess.  Luke's prolog is\nabout the only thing we have from the author describing his process.\nThe prolog sounds like Luke is from the next generation, and had to do\nsome investigating.  There are traditions passed down verbally that\nsay a few things about the composition of the Gospels.  There are\ndebates about how reliable these traditions are.  They certainly don't\nhave the status of Scripture, yet scholars tend to take some of them\nseriously.  One suggests that Mark was based on Peter's sermons, and\nwas written to preserve them when Peter had died or way about to die.\nOne tradition about Matthew suggests that a collection of Jesus words\nmay have been made earlier than the current Gospels.  \n\nIn the ancient world, it was much more common to rely on verbal\ntransmission of information.  I think many people would have preferred\nto hear about Jesus directly from someone who had known him, and maybe\neven from someone who studied directly under such a person, rather\nthan from a book.  Thus I suspect that the Gospels are largely from a\nperiod when these people were beginning to die.  Scholars generally do\nthink there was some written material earlier, which was probably used\nas sources for the existing Gospels.\n\nEstablishing the dates is a complex and technical business.  I have to\nconfess that I'm not sure how much reliance I'd put on the methods\nused.  But it's common to think that Mark was written first, around 64\nAD., and that all of the Gospels were written by the end of the\nCentury.

{"text":"Classify the following data: I dreamed that the great judgment morning had dawned,\n     and the trumpet had blown.\nI dreamed that the sinners had gathered for judgment\n     before the white throne.\nOh what weeping and wailing as the lost were told of their fate.\nThey cried for the rock and the mountains.\nThey prayed, but their prayers were too late.\nThe soul that had put off salvation, \n\"Not tonight I'll get saved by and by.\n No time now to think of ....... religion,\" \nAlas, he had found time to die.\nAnd I saw a Great White Throne.\n\nNow, some have protest by saying that the fear of hell is not good for\nmotivation, yet Jesus thought it was.  Paul thought it was.  Paul said, \n\"Knowing therefore, the terror of the Lord, we persuade men.\"\n\nToday, too much of our evangelism is nothing but soft soap and some of\nit is nothing but evangelical salesmanship.  We don't tell people anymore, that\nthere's such a thing as sin or that there's such a place as hell.  \n\nAs Jayne has said, this doesn't mean we have to come on so strong so as to hit\npeople over the head with a baseball bat.  Yet the fact remains, there is a\nplace called hell.  A place so fearful that God died to save us from having to\nexperience it.  Whatever you or I, as Christians, do, we should do whatever we\ncan to win people to the Lord, if for no other reason, to keep them from going\nto \"outer darkness.\".  \n\nJesus, in Mt. 25, tells us that He didn't prepare hell for people.  He prepared\nit for the Devil and his angels.  No where in the Bible do I read -anywhere,\nthat God predestined anybody to go to hell.  D.L. Moody use to say that the\nelect are the \"whosoever will\" and the nonelect are the \"whosoever wont's.\" \nWhether or not that's theologically sound, I couldn't defend, but its\npractical.  Jesus said to the people of Israel, \"Ye would not.\"  \n\nNow, some of you may not be students of the Bible, heck -some of you may not be\nChristians.  Have you ever said to somebody, \"I don't believe in hell.  I\nbelieve in the religion of Jesus.\"  But did you know that Jesus talked more\nabout hell than He did about heaven!  \"Oh I believe in the religion of the\nsermon on the mount.\"  You find hell taught by Jesus in the sermon on the\nmount.  You'll read that Jesus talked about the tree being cast into the fire. \nSeveral times he talks about hell and about judgment.  In fact, over and over\nin the synoptics, Matthew, Mark and Luke, Jesus talks about hell.  Not Isaiah. \nNot Moses.  Not John the Baptist, though he did, but Jesus, the Son of God. \nThe great Beloved One preached about hell because He loved people and didn't\nwant to see them go there.\n\nNow, if there is no hell then Jesus preached in vain.  It was our Lord Jesus,\nnot some angry Baptist preacher, that said, \"where the worm never dies, and\nwhere the fire never goes out.\"  Jesus said that.  It was Jesus who called hell\na \"furnace of fire.\"  It was Jesus that used the word, \"condemnation.\"  \"And\nthis is the condemnation, that men love darkness rather than light because\ntheir deeds are evil.  Jesus said that.  \n\nHow can we get it across to you that a loving, dying Jesus preached about hell?\n Not only that, but He went through hell.  That's what Calgary was all about. \nWhen my Lord was on the cross, darkness fell.  He called hell, \"outer\ndarkness.\"  \n\nDo you have this idea that hell is a place where the gamblers are gambling over\nhere, the drunks are getting drunk over there, and the prostitutes are\nprostituting their bodies over there?  That's not what hell is.  Hell's not a\nparty.  There's no fellowship there.  He called it \"outer darkness.\"  \"Outer\"\n-away from God.  \"Darkness\" -God is light.  \n\nNo when He was on the cross, He was made sin for you and for me.  God treated\nJesus the way sinners have to be treated.  That's is a sobering thought.  As my\nson would say, an \"awesome\" thought.  \n\n\"My God, My God why hast Thou forsaken me?\"  Hell is isolation.  There's no\nfellowship in hell.  There's no friendship in hell.  There's no loving embrace\nin hell.  There's no hand shake in hell.  There's no word of encouragement in\nhell.  \n\n\"I thirst.\"  It goes much deeper than physical thirst.  Hell is eternal craving\nwith no satisfaction.  The man whose life was lived for drugs, will crave it\neternally.  The man whose life was lived for the lust of a woman's body, will\ncrave it eternally -and not be satisfied.  One theologian has put it this way\nand I think it deserves merit.  What is hell?  Hell is just the kind of\nenvironment that matches the internal condition of the lost.  \n\nIn a recent post, I was trying to remember the founder of The Word of Life\nministries.  I've remembered his name, Jack Wertzen, and found that the\nillustration that I gave wasn't his.  His illustration was that he was talking\nto his barber and his barber's wife and daughter had just recently been saved\nand he was commenting about it to Jack.  \"They sing these songs and read Bible\nverses, and their praising this and that -I can't stand it!  Jack, do you think\nGod would send me to hell?\"  Jack answered by saying, \"Yes I think he would!\" \nOf course the barber said, \"What do you mean by that.\"  \"Well if you can't\nstand living at home with your wife and daughter who sing hymns and praises to\nGod now, what would you do in heaven where they'll do it for eternity?  You'd\nbe miserable.  Because God loves you, He'd put you where it would match what\nyou really are.\"   It makes a man think.\n\nThe crucifixion of Jesus Christ is a fact that necessitates the eternal\nexistence of hell because on the cross He performed an eternal act.  Don't ask\nme how, I don't know.  But He is God and He is the infinite/eternal and when He\ndied, He died an infinite/eternal death.  It is by that eternal act that He\npurchased eternal life for the \"whosoever wills.\"  He suffered eternal\njudgment.  \n\nA lot of people would like to detour around hell by saying \"Everybody is going\nto be saved eventually.\"  -universalism.  My Bible says no, He'll separate\nthem.  The sheep from the goats.  \".After you die there's a probationary period\nin which God prepares you for heaven.\"  No, my Bible says that \"It is appointed\nunto men once to die and then comes judgment.\"  Some of the cultist believe in\nannihilation.  After you die, sssswish.  Just like a mosquito you're squished\nout.  No, in Rev we are told that their is eternal existence in hell just as\nthere is in heaven.  \n\nI don't enjoy making these kind of statements and maybe you don't enjoy\nlistening to them, but we have to preach the entire Word of God.  -There is a\nplace called hell.  If I could give one verse of Scripture that could give any\nhope that people aren't going there, I'd give it to you, but I haven't found\nit.  That fact that there is a place called hell, the fact that our God is a\nGod of holiness and must judge sin, the fact that He has made us the kind of\ncreatures we are and therefore we're responsible, the fact that He has placed\nus in a \"uni\"verse that has purpose and design behind it, the fact that sin is\nsuch an awful thing and the fact that God Himself went through hell to save us\nfrom hell leads us to two applications.\n\n1)  As I've already mentioned.  If you are a Christian, you must worn others. \nIts not good enough to stop and fix their flat tire and not tell them that just\naround the bend the bridge is out.  \"Knowing therefore the terror of Lord, we\npersuade men.\"\n\n2)  If you haven't accepted Jesus are your Savior, you're taking an awful\nchance.  As I say to the Jehovah Witnesses (who no longer frequent my door), if\nyou are right and I am wrong, then I will have lived a good life and will die\nand cease to exist, but if I am right and you are wrong, then you will die and\nsuffer eternal damnation.  I don't mean to make fun at this point, but its like\nDirty Harry said, \"You've got to ask yourself, 'Do I feel lucky?'  Well do\nyou?\"  \"A man's got to know his limitations.\"  Don't be one of the \"whosoever\nwont's.\"  ","label":"soc.religion.christian"}

So they  may corrupt it, or turn it to their own way to\nmake their living. i.e Muslims have to pay  %20 percent of their income to the Mullahs.

He created\nthe earth, he could have been anywhere? why on top the mountain? Was it because people thought to see God\nyou have to reach to the skies/heavens? Why God kept coming back to Middle East? Was it because they created\nGod through their imagination?  Is that why Jewish people were told by God, they were the chosen ones?\n\nProfit Mohammad was married to Khadijeh. She was a Jewish. She taught him how to trade. She probably taught\nhim about Judaism. Quran is mostly copy right of Taurah (sp? old testement). Do you think God wrote Quran?\nMakeh was a trade city before Islam. Do you think it was made to be the center of Islamic world because Mohammad\nwanted to expand his trade business? Is that why  God has put his house in there? \n\nI think this religious stuff has gone too far. All man kind are going to hurt from it if they do not wise up.\nLook at David Koresh, how that turned out? I am afraid in the bigger scale, the Jews and the Muslims will\nhave the same ending!!!!!!!!\n\nReligion is needed in the sense to keep people in harmony and keep them doing good things, rather than\nplotting each others distruction.

{"text":"Classify the following data: If Clipper comes to cellular phones along with legal proscriptions against\nusing other cipher systems on these phones, a new and potentially dangerous\nclass of crime is created.\n\nCriminals who very badly want inscrutable tactical communications (specifically\nthe terrorists and drug dealers who proponents of key escrow cite as threats)\nwill be highly motivated to steal the cipher phone of a legitimate user, and\nto kill this person or hold them hostage so discovery of compromise of the\ndevice will be delayed.\n\nOnce a suitable collection of devices is stolen, criminals can communicate\nwith impunity (assuming the cipher system carries no trapdoors apart from\nkey escrow) until and unless the compromise is discovered by some other means.\n\nBecause life-is-cheap criminals are currently willing to kill people to steal\nvery large and conspicuous property (luxury cars), it is reasonable to assume\nthat they will be willing to kill people to steal small and inconspicuous\nproperty (a cipher cellular phone).  Just as we have seen in the past with\n\"blue box\" technology, and in the present with modified cellular phones,\nwe can expect to see among high-stakes criminals a lucrative market for\nstolen cipher phones which can be used for a few days.  The high-stakes\ncriminals will pay the life-is-cheap types substantial amounts for stolen\ninstruments.\n\nBecause a person is typically discovered as missing or dead in a few days,\na stolen instrument will be usable for only a few days.  There will be a\ncontinuing demand for fresh phones: fresh bodies.\n\nIn other words, Clipper and similar systems have the potential to turn a\ncurrent inconvenience to law enforcement into a direct, vicious, and\npersistent threat to the general public.\n\nOn the other hand, if a criminal were to apply some arbitrary cipher to a\ndevice in a mostly non-ciphered network, the communication will at least\nstand out as being unusual, and perhaps worthy of other means of investigation.\n\nFinally, because there is essentially no possibility of intercepting in\nrealtime the scrutable content of communications between stolen instruments,\nthere will exist strong motivation to record and archive _all_ communications\nin the network for ex-post-facto scrutiny (once some criminal act is discovered,\nand the instruments involved have been identified).

The\nproposal clearly states:\n\n=> The initiative will involve the creation of new products to\n=> accelerate the development and use of advanced and secure\n=> telecommunications networks and wireless communications links.\n\nIt speaks about telecommunications in general. Read it again, David.\nMaybe you'll understand it the next time... Nah, probably not.\n\n\nThat's exactly what the government wants all sheep-minded people to\nthink. Let's look at the current situation. It allows to almost\nanybody to eavesdrop almost everybody, unless secure (and I mean\nsecure) encryption is used. What will happen when (\"if\"? Ha!\noptimists...) the new proposal gets accepted? Almost nobody EXCEPT\nSOME will be able to eavesdrop everybody else, but the ability of\nthese \"some\" to eavesdrop will be guaranteed! The proposal emphasizes\non the former (\"almost nobody\") - which is clearly an improvement -\nand \"forgets\" to mention the drawbacks of the latter (\"guaranteed\").\nYes, my statement assumes that the next step will be to make the\nstrong crypto unlawful. You think that it will not happen? Good luck.\n\n\nIt's not just \"continued ability\". It's -guaranteed- ability.\n\n\nYeah, that's exactly what your government wants you to think. Let's\ntake small steps, one at a time. Concentrate on the current one, don't\nthink about the future. Trust us.\n\n\nIt's not asked because the proposal clearly says that this is the\nintention. They, unlike you, read what they write.\n\n\nYes, it will. It will stop the jerk who is eavesdropping now. It will\nallow only to the government to eavesdrop. (If the scheme is secure,\nof course, which is yet to be proven.) But how do you know that the\njerk you are fearing now will not get a government job tomorrow? The\nnew proposal -guarantees- him the ability to eavesdrop then. Hell,\nthat will even motivate him to get that job - if he indeed is that\nmentally pervert...\n\n\nGreat. The Greatest Cryptographer of All Times David Sternlight (tm)\nhas succeeded to evaluate the new system in the absense of any\ndetails whatsoever and has concluded that it is \"highly secure\". I\nguess, that comes from the background of working some 50 years for the\ntwo major crypto evaluating companies, right? Gee, now the government\ncan save all that money and trouble to ask a secret council of crypto\nexperts to secretly analyse the new secret method - for David\nSternlight has already done all the job for them...\n\n\n\"Trust us, we're from the Government and we're here to help you.\"\n\n\n\"Those who are prepared to trade their liberties for the promises of\nfuture safety, do not deserve either.\" This (or something like that; I\ndon't have the exact quote, but the meaning is the same) has been said\nby one of your great men. Maybe you should study their works more\ncarefully, if you have the brains to understand them, of course.\n\n\nThe main question is to guarantee to availability of -really- secure\ncryptography to the masses. Gee, if the proposal was saying \"we\nguarantee that every American will still have the full right to use\nany kind of encryption s/he would like and regard this proposal as\njust a default, voluntary implementation\", there would have been much\nless opposition... For some reason, they didn't even try to promise\nyou that. I wonder why... Was Orwell off only by 10 years?\n\n\nNo, in return you get crypto that is guaranteed to be crippled.\n\n\nWhile the above is just rumors, and while even if it is true, it is\nnot done -easily-, the new scheme can is guaranteed to be easily\nbreakable by anybody who has the two keys. It might be also breakable\nby somebody who does not have them but knows the right trick. Or who\nhas only one of them. NSA also told you that DES is secure, why don't\nyou simply trust them, huh?\n\n\nIt is -guaranteed- to be -easily- breakable - just get the keys. It\nmight be even easier, but until there is some evidence, this is just a\nwild speculation.\n\n\nThe trapdoors -are- there. In government's hands. The keys.\n\n\nLegitimate? And who decides what communications are legitimate? Oh, I\nguess, it's the government, right? The guys who already have the keys?\nIt's kinda if I have the keys from your car and I am asked to decide\nwho has the right to use it \"legitimately\"...\n\n\nImpossible, since you are demonstrating the same level of incompetence\nand ignorance as in the provious threads.\n\n\nUnfortunately, I have yet to see you posting a technically competent\nmessage.\n\nRegards,\nVesselin","label":"sci.crypt"}

The other animals on this planet,\n\tincluding those with advanced mental facilities, seem perfectly\n\tcontent in their ignorance.\n\n\tI'd like to point out that your presuppositions scream out at me\n\tfrom your unsupported statement.  They are: 1) humans are animal\n\t*only*; 2) religion exists as a crutch so that the unexplained need\n\tnot be researched; 3) religion was \"made up\" by humans to address a\n\tperceived need; 4) the biological aspect of humans is deified (that\n\tis, all aspects of human life can be categorized in a hierarchical\n\tstructure with biology at the apex).\n\n\tNeedless to say, I disagree with your strong opinion #1 and the\n\tunderlying presuppositions.\n\n\n\tI disagree that Christianity is \"an infectious cult\".  It has\n\tcertainly shown itself to be persistent as a belief system, in\n\tspite of various persecutions throughout the past two millenia.\n\tThat it continues to persevere does not demonstrate that it is\n\t\"infectious\" in a derrogatory sense; it may be that it provides\n\ta workable system for its adherents (and I would argue that this\n\tis the case).\n\n\tI disagree that Christianity is \"a safety blanket\" which supplants\n\thope and purpose.  Rather, it points an individual to the one\n\tSource of hope and purpose.  There is nothing hidden about a\n\tChristian's source for hope and purpose.  Of what usefulness to\n\tyou is the distinction between internally motivated hope and purpose\n\tand externally given hope and purpose?  Is the (apparent) loss of\n\tcontrol over one's own life the problem or is it something else?\n\n\tFinally, one does not appropriate \"eternal happiness\" by following\n\tChristian moral standards.  Indeed, the sole reason for the existance\n\tof Christianity is *because* standards are inadequate to save people\n\tfrom their imperfections.  Moral standards are merely guides to the\n\tChristian; the real power to moral living is given to the Christian\n\tin the Person of God's Spirit.\n\n\tHeaven is one of two final states that\n\tChristian doctrine postulates.  However, Christians are generally\n\tnot motivated to live according to Christian moral standards by this\n\tpromised future reward; rather, they are motivated by the perceived\n\tbenefits to them in the here-and-now.\n\n\n\tMany Christian organizations are concerned with evangelism as a\n\tpriority, and rightly so (for it was Jesus Himself who gave this\n\tas a priority for His followers).  However, it is not the penultimate\n\tpriority as evangelism is normally understood (i.e. preach the word,\n\tconvert at nearly any cost, repeat with new convert ad infinitum).\n\tRather, such evangelism is generally best done through respecting\n\tthe opinions of others while *demonstrating* the very real benefits\n\tof a Christian lifestyle.  This demonstration should be so powerful\n\tthat it compels the non-Christian to seek out the Christian to ask\n\t\"Why?\"  Needless to say, such a demonstration is not easily accom-\n\tplished (it takes a radical committment to the person of Jesus), it\n\tdoes not happen quickly (so perseverance on the part of the Christian\n\tis required), and it cannot occur where no personal bonds of\n\tfriendship exist (it is ineffective with strangers who cannot\n\tevaluate the demonstration over time, and it is easy to alienate or\n\tharm others if the sole purpose of being a \"friend\" is to gain a\n\tconversion).\n\n\tAs a long-time Christian (nearly 20 years), I view with some skep-\n\tticism *all* evangelism programs which incorporate a \"hurry-up\"\n\tattitude.  Pressured conversions may ultimately be worse than no\n\tconversion at all (because the pressured convert realizes s/he was\n\tcoerced and disavows Christianity when they would have been open\n\tto it in the future had they not been taken advantage of now).\n\tThe Bible states that it is the very Spirit of God which brings\n\tconviction of wrong-doing to people.  I am content to do my part\n\t(witness) and let the Spirit do the rest.\n\n\n\tWe are far more than animals.  We sleep, eat, reproduce, and die\n\tjust as other animals do - true.  But, we are also capable of more\n\tthan this.  If your personal vision of humanity (or of yourself) is\n\tso limited, I can only hope and pray ;-) that you will someday find\n\ta more expansive view.\n\n\t(For reflection, what animals have the wide variety of performing\n\tarts that humans do?  How is it that humans can learn the language\n\tof other humans (or animals) but that other animals cannot do so?\n\tHow is it that humans can organize themselves in various social\n\tstructures whereas other animals have only one structure?)\n\n\n\tBlatant assertion.  Christianity is not physically addictive.\n\tChristianity is not psychologically addictive.  Christianity is not\n\ta *thing* which one snorts/ingests/shoots-up; it is a relationship\n\twith a living being.  You might as validly characterize any close-\n\tknit relationship with this appelation.\n\n\n\tThere are \"Jesus freaks\" who let the emotional aspects of worship\n\tand Christian living gain (and retain) the upper hand.  Even so,\n\tthis does not by itself invalidate the foundation from which these\n\tthings flow.\n\n\n\tGuilty by association?  That \"christianity\" which forces itself\n\tupon another is not Christianity at all.\n\n\n\tYou appear to have an amazing certainty about what really happened\n\t2000 years ago.  How did you come by it?\n\n\tI cannot accept your conclusion that Jesus' influence was a sole\n\tresult of the Roman sack of Jerusalem in 70AD.  He was 30+ years\n\tgone by this time.

{"text":"Classify the following data: The concept of God as a teacher is indeed interesting. Does He grade on\na curve, does He cheat? That is interesting. Not to mention thought\nprovoking. My own concept is that He is a Father and we are His\nchildren. In that He loves us, with a love that we can never understand\nuntil we are with Him. The Bible says that He looks on the heart as the\nfinal measure. From that perspective, in a grading context, the heart is\nthe final test.\nSpecifically, most Christians would agree that there is only one Heaven\nand one Hell. From that perspective, it is Heaven or Hell. You either go\nto one or the other. The \"grading\" on a pass/fail basis is done by God\nthe Father with intervention by Jesus the Son. Not by others. For only\nGod sees the heart. The Bible says of the heart, \"...who can know it.\" I\nwould say there has always been, and always be, an unchanging method.\nThat is what makes a relationship with Christ so secure. In an uncertain\nand ever changing landscape He is always the same. Yesterday, today and\ntomorrow. Concerning whether or not our childhoods are considerd as part\nof the test, my own conviction is no. Were that the case I certainly\nwouldn't be going to Heaven. The Bible speaks very plainly about the\nlove and care Jesus had for and about children. The reality is that we\nare all children. Some of us just have bigger bodies and grey hair. But\nthe Father, our Father is always there. Like most Fathers He wants only\nthe best for His own. There maybe decipline, but there is more love.\nIt's sometimes looks like Christianity is a test, to see who makes it\nand who doesn't. Those who do pass=Heaven, and those who don't go to the\nother place. But it is really much more than that...\nThere are few experts.

{"text":"Classify the following data: or\nthere\n\n\nOkay, I guess its time for a quick explanation of Mac sound.\n\nThe original documentation for the sound hardware (IM-3) documents how to\nmake sound by directly accessing hardware.  Basically, you jam values\ninto all the even bytes from SoundBase to SoundBase+0x170. This was\nbecause\nof how the Mac 128 (and some later machines) generated sound was by\nscanning\nthis block and D/Aing every even byte (the odd bytes went to the floppy on\nsome machines).\n\nWhen the Mac II (and Apple Sound Chip) was invented, it was designed to\ngenerate stereo sound. It was also designed to be compatible with we had\nonce\ndocumented. So storing bytes at the even values at SoundBase meant \"I\nwant to\nplay a mono sound\" and so it was emulated. But Apple had since retracted\nthe\ndocumentation on SoundBase and decided not to document the lowest layers\nof\nsound generation. So apple never explained where to stuff bytes if you\nwant\nto make stereo sound.\n\nEnter game developers. The sound driver and current sound manager are\ninconveniently lame for making games. Furthermore, people who port from\nthe\nIBM don't want to learn more APIs. So, it has become popular for game\nwriters to write to SoundBase to make sound, since it is very easy.\n\nSince the Mac II, Apple has had many different kind of sound output\nhardware,\nand the only things they have in common are that writing to SoundBase\nworks.\nOn some hardware, (Mac II, IIx, IIcx, IIci at least), writing to SoundBase\ngets you mono sound through both speakers. On some Macs (Quadra\n700/900/950\nat least) writing to SoundBase gets you mono sound on the left channel\nonly.\nBoth are technically correct interpretations of the original\nspecification,\nbut one is obviously preferable for asthetic reasons.\n\nIf developers use the Sound Manager (and I think the sound driver), mono\nsounds will (typically) come out through both channels regardless of the\nunderlying hardware. It is possible to specify you want to generate left\nchannel only, but no one does. If developers write to sound base, their\ngames will only come out the left on some games.\n\nThe other problem, the original Mac II only producing left channel sound\non the internal speaker, while the SE/30 mixes both, isn't really related.\nIt is due to the post generation amplification used on the motherboards of\nthe different machines. It only affects true stereo sounds. Sounds which\nare actually mono, will play on the internal speaker, no matter what\nmachine\nyou have.\n\nNow, to more directly address the question, the games you list:\nand also\nHellcats,\nSuper Tetris\nOxyd\n(and many more, these are just what I've tested)\n\nCheat and write to SoundBase and so are only left channel on Quadras.\n\n\nOther games you list:\nand also\nPGA Tour Golf\nCivilization\n(and more, these are again only from personal experience)\n\nUse the sound manager and work fine on all machines.\n\nThe more of the story is to developers: DON'T CHEAT!\nReally, I am absolutely, positively not allowed to do what I am about to\ndo,\nbut I'm going say it anyway.\nStop cheating on sound!\nReally soon, you will be sorry, as even those without external speakers\nwill be disappointed with your sound on future hardware. The grace period\nis about to end.\nThe Sound Manager is understandable now, and works pretty well and will\nwork\neven better soon, so use it.\n\nIn conclusion:\nTo Doug, it isn't a hardware problem, at least, not a bug.\nTo Jon, it isn't a choice to developers as to whether they want to send\nsound\nto both channels. If they do it the right way, it is taken care of\nautomatically. If you cheat, there is not way to make it work on all\nhardware.\n\n\nHave fun.\n\nDisclaimer number 1:\nI don't work on sound here at Apple, I'm just pretty well informed.\nSo don't write me with sound questions.\n\nDisclaimer number 2:\nIf it says up above that I wrote anything like \"the grace period is about\nto end\" then it is a bug in your news feed, since I am catagorically not\nallowed to say anything like that.

I'am arguing about \n: the Armenian-Nazi colaboration during World War II. Any comment?\n\n\nIt could be, perhaps, your head wasn't screwed on just right. In 1941, \nwhile the Jews were being assembled for their doom in the Nazi concentration \ncamps, the Armenian volunteers in Germany formed the first Armenian \nbattalion to fight alongside the Nazis. In 1943, this battalion had \ngrown into eight battalions of 20,000-strong under the command of the\nformer guerilla leader Dro (the butcher), who was the former dictator of the\nshort-lived Armenian Dictatorship (1918-1920) and the architect of the \ncold-blooded genocide of 2.5 million Turks and Kurds between 1914-1920.\nAn Armenian National Council was formed by the notorious Dashnak Party \nleaders in Berlin, which was recognized by the Nazis. Encouraged by \nthis, the Armenians summarily formed a provisional government that endorsed \nand espoused fully the principles of the Nazis and declared themselves as the \nmembers of the Aryan super race and full participants to Hitler's policy of \nextermination of the Jews.\n\nThis Armenian-Nazi conspiracy against the Jews during WWII was an \"encore\"\nperformance staged by the Armenians during WWI, when they back-stabbed and\nexterminated 2.5 million Turks by colluding with the invading Russian army.\n\nFurthermore, as McCarthy put it, the Armenian dictatorship was granted\na respite when the Ottomans admitted defeat and signed the Mudros\nArmistice with the Allies (October 30, 1918). The Allies had decided\nto create a Greater Armenia, including the old Russian province\nof Yerevan and adjoining areas, as well as most parts of Anatolia\nclaimed by the Armenian fanatics. Only the area called Cilicia\n(around the Ottoman province of Adana) was to be excluded, as it\nhad already been claimed by the French. The Allies quickly set\nabout attempting to disarm Ottoman soldiers and other Turks, who\ncould be expected to oppose their plans. \n\nOn April 19, 1919 the British Army occupied Kars, gave civilian\nand military power over to the Armenians, then withdrew. The British\nplanned for Kars to be included in the Armenian Dictatorship, even \nthough the Russian pre-war census had shown Kars Province to be over\n60% Muslim. The Turks of Kars were effectively disarmed, but the \nBritish could not disarm the Kurds of the mountains. The fate of\nthe Turks was almost an exact replica of what had occurred earlier\nin Eastern Anatolia. Murder, pillage, genocide and the destruction\nof Turkish homes and entire Turkish villages drove the Turks of\nKars to the mountains or south and west to the safety afforded\nby remaining units of the Ottoman Army. The British had left \nthe scene to the Armenian genocide squads. Therefore, few \nEuropeans were present to observe the genocide. One British\nsoldier, Colonel Rawlinson, who was assigned to supervise the\ndisarmament of Otoman soldiers, saw what was occurring. \n\nRawlinson wired to his superiors, \n\n\"in the interest of humanity the Armenians should not be left in\n independent command of the Moslim population, as, their troops \n being without discipline and not being under effective control,\n atrocities were constantly being committed.\" \n\n\nCome again?\n\n: \"These European Dashnags, with headquarters in Berlin, appealed to...\n\nWhy?\n\n: No wonder you are in such a mess.

{"text":"Classify the following data: \nDarren> In an earlier article, I explained that what many people find\nDarren> arrogant about Christians is that some Christians profess\nDarren> absolute certainty about their beliefs and doctrines.\n\nand\n\nDarren> In short, the problem is that no matter how good your sources\nDarren> are, if any part of your doctrines or beliefs rest on your own\nDarren> thinking and reasoning, then those doctrines are suspect.\n\nThe point that Darren raises is a very Lutheran viewpoint.  \nWhile reason is a gift from God, it is also infected by sin.\nYet we do not reject reason entirely--and neither, I think, \ndoes Darren.  We need reason, as Darren himself has pointed\nout, to comprehend God's revelation of himself in the Bible.\nBut reason alone is not sufficient to comprehend and believe\nthe Word.  We need, first and foremost, faith.  For \"the sinful\nmind is hostile to God.  It does not submit to God's law,\n*nor can it do so*\"  (Romans 8:7).\n\nLuther accepted Scripture as the sole means of revelation\n(\"Sola Scriptura\"), but accepted the necessity of the use\nof reason (with faith) in comprehending that revelation.\nYet Luther also said, regarding baptism, \"But mad reason\nrushes forth, and, because Baptism is not dazzling like\nthe works which we do, regards it as worthless.\" (Large\nCatechism, Fourth part, Baptism).  To make matters more\ncomplicated, Luther was the sort of theologian that many \npeople would describe as an `absolutist'.  I've seen him \ndescribed as a `take no prisoners' theologian.\n\nWe might conclude, given these observations, that Luther\nwas inconsistent or mad.  And surely at least some have\ncome to that conclusion.  But it might be useful to\nrecall that Jesus was also called mad.  And Peter felt\ncompelled to defend himself and the apostles against\na charge of drunkenness on Pentecost.  So we as Christians\nought to be careful about rejecting Luther (or others) \nas mad.  Rather, we should imitate the Bereans, who\nexamined the Scriptures every day to see if what Paul\nsaid was true (Acts 17:11).\n\nThe basis for the confidence with which Luther, Peter, Paul, and many\nothers preached the gospel was not just reason, but faith and the Holy\nSpirit.  This is not faith divorced from reason, but a faith that\nguides, informs, and uses reason.  The Spirit enables us to know the\ntruth and to proclaim it boldly.  God does not want us to preach the\nmessage that \"I think that Jesus might have risen from the dead\" but\nrather \"I know that my redeemer lives!\"  (Job 19:25).  The Christian\ndoes not side with Pilate in saying \"What is truth?\" but rather\nfollows Christ, who said, \"In fact, for this reason I was born, and\nfor this I came into the world, to testify to the truth.  Everyone on\nthe side of truth listens to me\" (John 18:37).\n\nWe can know the truth because God has promised us that we can\nknow the truth.  Jesus said, \"If you hold to my teachings,\nyou are really my disciples.  Then you will know the truth,\nand the truth will set you free\" (John 8:31,32).  The Proverbs\nurge us \"Buy the truth, and do not sell it.\" (Pr 23:23).\nThe Psalmist prayed \"Do not snatch to word of truth from my mouth\"\n(Ps 119:43).  Evidently he believed that the word of truth\nwas in fact `in his mouth'.  \n\nYet we do indeed appear arrogant if our claim to the truth\nis motivated by self-glorification.  But if we present the\ntruth as the teachings of Scripture, revealed by the \nSpirit, and not our own invention, and if we stand ready\nto be proved wrong on the basis of Scripture, as Luther\ndid, then we are not arrogant, but humble.  We should humbly\ntrust in God's promise of truth, just as we trust in his\npromise of forgiveness.\n\nREXLEX> It is only because of God's own revelation that we can be \nREXLEX> absolute about a thing.\n\nDarren> But how far does that get you?  Once God's revelation stops,\nDarren> and your own reasoning begins, possibility for error appears.\n\nI agree that we must make a distinction between the clear teachings\nof Scripture, and the products of our own reason--even when such\nreasoning is based on Scripture.  However I think I would draw\nthe line of distinction more `reasonably'  :-)  and less `academically'\nthan you would.\n\nDarren> For example, let's suppose that our modern Bible translations\nDarren> include a perfect rendering of Jesus words at the Last Supper,\nDarren> and that Jesus said, exactly, \"This is my body.\"\n\nDarren> We'll presume that what he said was totally without error and\nDarren> absolutely true.  What can we be certain of?  Not much.\n\nDarren> At the moment he stops speaking, and people start\nDarren> interpreting, the possibility of error appears.  Did he mean\nDarren> that literally or not?  We do not have any record that he\nDarren> elaborated on the words.  Was he thinking of Tran- or Con-\nDarren> substantiation?  He didn't say. \n\nDarren is almost at the point of making a very Lutheran statement\nabout the Lord's supper.  The Lutheran approach is to say\nthat if Jesus said, \"This is my body,\" then that is what we\nshould believe.  Other interpretations are rejected simply because\nthey are not taught in Scripture.\n\nRecall that Jesus' words do not stand alone on this subject.  We also\nhave Paul's words in 1 Corinthians 11:17-34,--in which he passed on to\nus, what he received from the Lord.  In particular he said, \"For\nwhenever you eat this bread and drink this cup, you proclaim the\nLord's death until he comes.\"  By these words we should believe that\nthe bread that we eat in the Lord's Supper really is bread (as well as\nthe Lord's body)--as our senses in fact tell us.  Does this *prove*\nthat tran-substantiation is false?  I suppose someone could say that\nPaul spoke metaphorically of the Lord's body as bread, simply because\nthat is the way the body appears when we eat it.  But this thought is\nfound nowhere in Scripture.  So we reject it.  Thus the primary\nreason for rejecting tran-substantiation is not that we can\nprove it false, but that it is simply not found in Scripture.\n\n[side remark]\nI've been told that the Lutheran doctrine on real presence is\ncon-substantiation.  But it has been non-Lutherans who have told\nme this.  We tend not to use the word.  I almost think that this\nis used more by professors of comparative religion, who need labels\nto compare Catholic, Lutheran and Reformed teachings on the Lord's\nSupper.  But almost every church wants to call their own teaching\n\"real presence\" because that was the traditional teaching of \nthe church.\n[end side remark]\n\nDarren> When Christians speak as if they believe their own reasoning\nDarren> can never lead them astray -- when we implicitly claim that we\nDarren> are infallible -- the non- Christians around us rarely believe\nDarren> that implicit claim.  Witnessing is hardly going to work when\nDarren> the person you are talking to believes that you are either too\nDarren> foolish to recognise your own limits, or intentionally trying\nDarren> to cover them up.\n\nThis is precisely why Christians should not rely on rationalizations\nin their witnessing.  It is far better to take the approach,\n\"I'd like to show you what Scripture says.  You decide for \nyourself whether to believe it or not.\"\n\nDarren> `REXLEX' suggested that people read _He is There and He is Not\nDarren> Silent_, by Francis Schaeffer.  I didn't think very highly of\nDarren> it, but I think that Mr Schaeffer is grossly overrated by many\nDarren> Evangelical Christians.  Somebody else might like it, though,\nDarren> so don't let my opinion stop you from reading it.\n\nDarren> If someone is interested in my opinion, I'd suggest _On\nDarren> Certainty_, by Ludwig Wittgenstein.\n\nAs long as we're trading references, I'd like to suggest Dr. Siegbert\nBecker's paperback, \"The Foolishness of God: The place of reason\nin Lutheran theology,\" published by Northwestern Publishing House.\nThis book was based on Becker's doctoral thesis at the University\nof Chicago.","label":"soc.religion.christian"}

I just reposted a\nvery good one, under the title \"Islam and Women\", reposted from\nsoc.religion.islam.  If this has already disappeared from your site,\nthen please email me telling me so and I will email you a copy of this\nexcellent article.  \n\nIMHO, your understanding of the issue of women in Islam is sadly deficient.\n\nRegarding slaves, _my_ posting on slavery -- the second one I made,\nwhich is a repost of an article I wrote early last year -- is based\ncompletely on the Qur'an and contains numerous Qur'anic verses and\nhadiths to support its point of view.\n\nOur approaches are different -- you are arguing from a historical\nstandpoint and I am arguing directly from the teachings of the Qur'an\nand hadiths.  Now, just because people say they are Muslims and perform\na particular action, does that automatically mean that their action is\npart of Islam, even if it is opposed by the Qur'an and Sunnah?  No!  Of\ncourse not.\n\nLet me give you a concrete example, which might help clarify this for\nyou.  The Qur'an prohibits drinking.  Now, if a person says \"I am a\nMuslim\" and then proceeds to drink a bottle of beer, does this now mean\nthat Islam teaches that people should drink beer?  Of course not, and\nonly an idiot would think so.\n\nDo you see my point?\n\n\nYou are judging Islam here on capitalist terms.  Capitalism is an\nideology based largely on the assumption that people want to maximise\ntheir wealth -- this assumption is in opposition to Islamic teachings.\nTo say Islam is bad because it is not capitalist is pretty unthinking --\nIslam does not pretend to be capitalist and does not try to be\ncapitalist.  (This does not mean that Islam does not support a\nfree-market -- for it does in general -- but there are other parts of \ncapitalism which are opposed to Islam as I understand it.)\n\n\nOne can postulate numerous reasons for this.  Your theory is that it is\nbecause Islam is not secularist and capitalist, etc. etc.\n\nSelim, I will give you a clear historical example to show you the\nfallacy of your views if you think (as you obviously do) that\nIslam => lack of education and power.\n\nFor a large part of history, the Islamic world was very powerful.  For a\nsignificant section of history, the Islamic world was the foremost in\nthe sciences.  So to say that Islam is, for example, anti-education is\ncompletely absurd.  You try to blame this situation on Islam -- history\nshows that your conclusion is false and that, instead, there must be\nother reasons for this situation.\n\n\nWell, Selim, your viewpoint on women in Islam makes me question the extent\nof your knowledge of Islam.  I really think you are not\nknowledgeable enough to be able to judge whether the Muslims are\nfollowing the Qur'an or not.\n\n\nThe Islamic world was at the forefront of the world in science at one\nstage -- yet somehow, in your theory, it is by \"following the Qur'an\"\nthat Muslims are backwards in education.  Selim, it is _your_ thesis\nthat is anti-historical, for you conveniently overlook this historical\nfact which contradicts your theory. \n\n\nYou have certainly not shown this; you have merely stated it.\nSo far, it seems to me that your view on Islam being anti-education is\nquite contrary to history.  That you are so convinced of your views\nmakes me wonder just how objectively you are trying to look at all of\nthis.\n\n\nI think, Selim, you should consider taking your own advice.\n\n\nHere too.\n\n\nSelim, you have such conviction of your viewpoint, yet you demonstrate\nignorance, not only of Islam but also of Islamic history (particularly\nwith respect to Muslims being leaders of science till about 1400 or so I\nthink).  Yet you say that your viewpoint is based on history!\n\nSelim, if I remember right, you say in one of your earlier posts that\nyou are an apostate from Islam.  I think you should slow down and start\nthinking clearly about the issues, and start _reading_ some of our\npostings about Islam rather than ignoring them as you so obviously\nhave.","label":"alt.atheism"}

It uses Postscript as a scripting language\nwhich is good if you need to do lots of display oriented scripting,\nbut not so good for non-programmers.

{"text":"Classify the following data: \nAgreed.  \n\n\nIt is a failure of libertarianism if the ideology does not provide any\nreasonable way to restrain such actions other than utopian dreams.  Just\nas Marxism \"fails\" to specify how pure communism is to be achieved and\nthe state is to \"wither away,\" libertarians frequently fail to show how\nweakening the power of the state will result in improvement in the human\ncondition.\n\n\nThis is a strawman argument and fails on several grounds.  In this case,\n\"limited\" and \"big\" government are not defined.  I would point out that\nLebanon, Somalia, and the former Yugoslavia are by some definitions nations\nwith \"limited\" government, while the US, Canada, and nations in Western \nEurope (where \"people would rather live\") are often pointed out as \nnations with \"big government\" from a libertarian point of view.  \n\nThe argument is not between those who want \"limited\" government and those\nwho want \"unlimited\" government.
