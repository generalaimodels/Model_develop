An atheist is one for whom all things can\nbe understood as processes of nature - exclusively. There is no need\nfor any recourse to Divnity to describe or explain anything. There is\nno purpose or direction for any event beyond those required by\nphysics, chemistry, biology, etc.; everything is random, nothing is\ndetermnined.\nThis would also have to include human intelligence of course and all\nits products. There is nothing requiring that life evolve or that it\nacquire intelligence, it's just a happy accident. For an atheist, no\nevent can be preferred to another or be said to have more or less\nvalue than another in any naturalistic sense, and no thought -about-\nan event can have value. \nThe products of our intelligence are acquired from our environment,\nfrom teaching, training, observation and experience and are only\nsignificant to the individual mind wherein they reside. These mental\nprocesses and the images they produce for us are just electrical\nactivity and nothing more; content is of no consequence. The human\nmind is as much a response to natural forces as water running down a\nhill.\nHow then can an atheist judge value? What is the basis for criticizing\nthe values ennumerated in the Bible or the purposes imputed to God? On\nwhat grounds can the the behavior of the reliogious be condemned? It\nseems that, in judging the values that motivate others to action, you\nhave to have some standard against which conduct is measured, but what\nin nature can serve that purpose? What law of nature can you invoke to\nestablish your values.\nSince every event is entirely and exclusively a physical event, what\ndifference could it possibly make what -anyone- does, religious or\notherwise, there can be no -meaning- or gradation of value. The only\nway an atheist can object to -any- behaviour is to admit that the\nobjection is entirely subjective and that he(she) just doesn't like it\n- that's it. Any value judgement must be prefaced by the disclaimer\nthat it is nothing more than a matter of personal opinion and carries\nno weight in any \"absolute\" sense.\nThat you don't like what God told people to do says nothing about God\nor God's commands, it says only that there was an electrical event in your\nnervous system that created an emotional state that your mind coupled\nwith a pre-existing thought-set to form that reaction. That your\nobjections -seem- well founded is due to the way you've been\nconditioned; there is no \"truth\" content. The whole of your\nintellectual landscape is an illusion, a virtual reality.\nI didn't make these rules, it's inherent in naturalistic atheism and\nto be consistent, you have to accept the non-significance of any human\nthought, even your own. All of this being so, you have excluded\nyourself from any discussion of values, right, wrong, goood, evil,\netc. and cannot participate. Your opinion about the Bible can have no\nweight whatsoever."},{"role":"assistant","content":"alt.atheism"}]}

I would also recommend Graham Greene's _Monsignor\nQuixote_ and any novel by Iris Murdoch.

For the first 6 months, the women each day ate\n8 ounces of yogurt containing Lactobacillus acidophilus. For the second \n6 months, the women did not eat yogurt. The researchers examined the    \nwomen each month and found that incidents of colonization and infection \nwere significantly lower during the period when the women ate yogurt.   \n  The fungus Candida albicans can live in the body without doing harm.  \nIt is an overproliferation of the fungus that leads to infection. The   \nresearchers concluded that the L. acidophilus bacteria found in some    \nbrands of yogurt retard overgrowth of the fungus. Streptococcus         \nthermophilus and L. bulgaricus are the two bacteria most commonly used  \nin commercial yogurt production. Neither one appears to exert a         \nprotective effect against Candida albicans, however. Women who want to  \ntry yogurt as a preventive measure should choose a brand that lists     \nacidophilus in its contents.                                            \n--- end ---\n              \n\n                              \n===================================\n\nInfoTrac - Health Reference Center ~ Oct '89 - Oct '92\n  THE MATERIAL CONTAINED IN Health Reference Center ~ Oct '89 - Oct '92 IS PROVIDED\n  ONLY FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES AND SHOULD NOT BE CONSTRUED AS\n  MEDICAL ADVICE OR INSTRUCTION.

From the outset,\nthe efforts of the Armenian revolutionaries within the Ottoman borders took\nthe form of terrorist and destructive actions aimed at mass murder, cruelty\nand genocide, so that no other interpretation of them is possible. Armenian\nactivities started during the reign of Abdulhamid II as individual acts of\nterror, and then developed into assassinations and surprise attacks. The element\nof brute force in these activities increased steadily, culminating in mass\nrebellions and widespread fighting during the First World War. Furthermore,\nwhen the Ottoman army withdrew from Eastern Anatolia after the 1915 Sarikamis\ndefeat, Armenian revolutionaries initiated a series of cruelties in this area.\nAlthough the Russians occupied Eastern Anatolia as an enemy, nevertheless they\nwere constrained by the rules of war. However, when they returned to their\ncountry in 1917 after the Revolution, Armenian revolutionaries were unchecked\nin this area for about a year until the Ottoman forces returned to Erzurum\nin 1918. During this period, Armenian revolutionaries executed massacres on\nthe local people which is recorded in historical documents.[1]\n\nFor example, let us look at a report dated 21 March 1918 which the Commander\nof the Third Army submitted when he entered Erzurum and Erzincan: \n\n \"They were completely and systematically destroyed and burned down \n  by Armenians, even the trees were cut down, and they are like a \n  building entirely consumed by fire in every sense of the word.\" \n\nAs for the people who had been living in Erzurum and Erzincan:\n\n\"Those who were capable of fighting were taken away at the very beginning\n with the excuse of forced labor in road construction, they were taken\n in the direction of Sarikamis and annihilated. When the Russian army\n withdrew, a part of the remaining people was destroyed in Armenian\n massacres and cruelties: they were thrown into wells, they were locked\n in houses and burned down, they were killed with bayonets and swords, in places\n selected as butchering spots, their bellies were torn open, their lungs\n were pulled out, and girls and women were hanged by their hair after\n being subjected to every conceivable abominable act. A very small part \n of the people who were spared these abominations far worse than the\n cruelty of the inquisition resembled living dead and were suffering\n from temporary insanity because of the dire poverty they had lived\n in and because of the frightful experiences they had been subjected to.\n Including women and children, such persons discovered so far do not\n exceed one thousand five hundred in Erzincan and thirty thousand in\n Erzurum. All the fields in Erzincan and Erzurum are untilled, everything\n that the people had has been taken away from them, and we found them\n in a destitute situation. At the present time, the people are subsisting\n on some food they obtained, impelled by starvation, from Russian storages\n left behind after their occupation of this area.\"[2]\n \nForeign observers who witnessed the events, including Russian Officers\nwho did not desert their lines, submitted detailed reports proving the\ngenocide to Ottoman commanders who received them as prisoners of war.\nWhat is most important is that they stated in their reports 'the \nmassacres did not happen by chance but were planned.'[3]\n\nAt the end of the war, the German author Dr. Weiss, his Austrian colleague\nDr. Stein and his Turkish colleague Mr. Ahmet Vefik visited Trabzon, Kars,\nErzurum and Batum between April 17th and May 20th 1918 to record the\ncruelties.

Unfortunately,\nthe specification for XGrabKey doesn't allow AnyModifier to be combined\nwith other modifiers, which is exactly what would be desired in this case:\n\"Ctrl Any<Key>q\".\n\n\nThis is true for accelerators and mnemonics, which are implemented using\nevent handlers instead of grabs; it's not true for menu accelerators.  If\nyou're a Motif implementor, I'd suggest lobbying to get the Xlib semantics\nchanged to support the feature I described above.  Otherwise, change the\ndocumentation for menu accelerators to properly set the user's\nexpectations, because menu accelerators are NOT the same thing as\ntranslations.\n\n\nIf you mean \"menu accelerator\", no it's not possible.  That's according to\nthe definition of the XmNaccelerator resource in the XmLabel manual page.\n\n\nI can't think of a reason why not.\n\n\nThere is a workaround for Motif users.  In addition to the normal menu\naccelerator you install on the XmPushButton[Gadget], set an XtNaccelerators\nresource on the shell (TopLevel or Application).  Install the shell's\naccelerators on itself and all of its descendants with\nXtInstallAllAccelerators (shell, shell).\n\nFor example,\n\n  applicationShell - mainWindow - menuBar - fileCascade\n\t\t\t\t\t  -- filePulldown - openPushbutton\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  - exitPushbutton\n\n  *openPushbutton.accelerator = Ctrl<Key>O\n  *openPushbutton.acceleratorText = Ctrl+O\n  *exitPushbutton.accelerator = Ctrl<Key>Q\n  *exitPushbutton.acceleratorText = Ctrl+Q\n\n  *applicationShell.accelerators = #override\\n\\\n    Ctrl<Key>O: PerformAction(*openPushbutton, ArmAndActivate)\\n\\\n    Ctrl<Key>Q: PerformAction(*exitPushbutton, ArmAndActivate)\n\nYou have to write and add the application action PerformAction, which you\ncan implement by using XtNameToWidget on the first argument and then\nXtCallActionProc with the rest of the arguments.\n\nI tested out something similar to this.  To shorten development time, I\nused TeleUSE's TuNinstallAccelerators resource to install the accelerators\non the shell, and I directly invoked the Open and Quit D actions instead\nof asking the pushbuttons to do it for me, but the more general approach I\ndescribed above should work."},{"role":"assistant","content":"comp.windows.x"}]}

Hentrich        baba@Tymnet.Com\n-\n   I would like to go on record as objecting to Mr. Hentrich calling\nhimself an Aryan.  The word `Aryan' is of Sanskrit origin and occurs first\nin the Hindu scripture, the Rigveda.  It seems to have been a tribal term\nbut may have had connotations of good character.  Such connotations\nare quite explicit in the sayings of the Buddha who called his religion the\neightfold Aryan path.   The word was borrowed by the German scholar\nMax Mueller who used it as a synonym for `indo-european', but then the\nNazis proceeded to steal it and started pretending that `aryan' is\nsynonymous with `nordic' which seems highly unlikely.  The people who\noriginally called themselves aryas,  the Iranians, Noprth Indians, the Afghans\nand possibly the Kurds, are none of them nordic.  So the use of the word\nby Westerners, though meant with apparent good humor in this case, is\nnontheless inappropriate.  The only Westerners who may have some claim\nto call themselves Aryans (by descent) are the Celts who seem to have wor-\nshipped a god called Aryaman who is mentioned in the Rigveda.\n\n  If you want to check what I am saying, look at  Mallory's book, ``In\nsearch of the Indo-Europeans\" or, just look at the Encyclopedia Britannica.\nThe reason this usage is offensive is that most of Ancient Indian literature\nas well as religion is directly or inderectly due to the Aryans and\nfor Westerners to butt in is really not nice, not to mention the horrible\nthings done by Germans to Jews, using a word to which the Germans have\nno clear claim."},{"role":"assistant","content":"talk.politics.misc"}]}

For some\nreason, I always took the 'resurrection' in this statement to mean the\nresurrection of the soul, but I guess resurrection does strictly mean\nthe raising of the physical body.  I have some questions on this point:\n\n1.  I always thought that Christians believe the descent into hell was \npretty much immediate, and that there are people burning in hell right\nnow.  You seem to be implying that it will not occur until after the\n\"great judgement\" (which I read as meaning the proverbial Judgment Day).\nI was always a little confused on this point, even when I was with the\nchurch -- maybe someone can clear it up for me.  Where will my \"soul\"\n(which, by the way, I don't believe in) exist until that time?\n\n2.  Will the new body I will have be created out of the same atoms \nthat my body now is made of, or will it be built from scratch?  My\nphysical body now is susceptible to aging, etc. -- so I guess my\nnew body will have to be radically different in order to be immortal\nso it can be tortured for all eternity?\n\n3.  Since I will have a physical body, I assume it will need a physical\nplace to exist in -- where is this hell?  In the center of the earth?\nDo you think we could find it if we dig?\n\nMark Schnitzius\nschnitzi@eola.cs.ucf.edu\nUniv. of Central Florida\n\n[There is not complete agreement on the details of the afterlife.  I\nthink the most common view is that final disposition does not occur\nuntil a final judgement, which is still in the future.  In the\nmeantime, some believe that people \"sleep\" until the final\nresurrection (or because God is above time, pass directly from death\nto the future time when the resurrection occurs), while others believe\nthat souls have a disembodied, pre-resurrection existence until then.\nThere are probably other alternatives that I'm omitting.\n\nThe new body is generally conceived of being implemented in a\ndifferent \"technology\" than the current one, one which is not mortal.\n(Paul talks about the mortal being raised to immortality, and Jesus'\nresurrected body -- which is the first example -- clearly was not\nsubject to the same kind of limitations as ours.)  It is assumed that\nthere are enough similarities that people will recognize each other,\nbut I don't think most people claim to know the details.  I don't\nthink I'd say it's the same atoms.  I'd assume there would be some\nanalog of a physical place, but I wouldn't expect to find it under the\nearth or up in the sky.

It was filed on behalf of about 12,000\nanti-apartheid activists or opponents of Israeli policies about whom the\nplaintiffs believe the ADL, Bullock and Gerard gathered information.\n     Representatives of the ADL in San Francisco were not immediately available\nfor comment on Wednesday.\n     The civil suit is the first legal action arising out of allegations that\nGerard, a former inspector in the San Francisco police intelligence unit, passed\nconfidential police files on California political activists to a spy ring.\n     The FBI and San Francisco police are investigating the ADL, Bullock and\nGerard over the affair and last week searched the ADL's offices in San Francisco\nand Los Angeles.\n     The suit alleges invasion of privacy under the Civil Code of California,\nwhich prohibits the publication of information obtained from official sources.\nIt seeks exemplary damages of at least $2,500 per person as well as other\nunspecified damages.\n     Lawyer Pete McCloskey, a former Congresmen who is representing the\nplaintiffs, said the 19 plaintiffs included Arab-Americans and Jews -- and his\nwife Helen, who also had information gathered about her.\n     One of the plaintiffs is Yigal Arens, a research scientist at the\nUniversity of Southern California who is a son of the former Israeli Defence\nMinister.\n     Arens told the San Francisco Examiner he had seen a file the ADL kept on\nhim in the 1980s, presumably because of his criticism of the treatment of\nPalestinians and his position on the Israeli-occupied territories.\n     According to court documents released last week, Bullock and Gerard both\nkept information on thousands of California political activists.\n     In the documents, a police investigator said he believed the ADL paid\nBullock for many years to provide information and that both the league and\nBullock received confidential information from the authorities.\n     No criminal charges have yet been filed in the case. The ADL, Bullock and\nGerard have all denied any wrongdoing.\n  REUTER AC KG CM\n\n\n\nAPn  04/14 2202  ADL Lawsuit\n\nCopyright, 1993. The Associated Press. All rights reserved.\n\nBy CATALINA ORTIZ\n Associated Press Writer\n   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Arab-Americans and critics of Israel sued the\nAnti-Defamation League on Wednesday, saying it invaded their privacy by\nillegally gathering information about them through a nationwide spy network.\n   The ADL, a national group dedicated to fighting anti-Semitism, intended to\nuse the data to discredit them because of their political views, according to\nthe class-action lawsuit filed in San Francisco Superior Court.\n   \"None of us has been guilty of racism or Nazism or anti-Semitism or hate\ncrimes, or any of the other `isms' that the ADL claims to protect against. None\nof us is violent or criminal in any way,\" said Carol El-Shaieb, an education\nconsultant who develops programs on Arab culture.\n   The 19 plaintiffs include Yigal Arens, son of former Israel Defense Minister\nMoshe Arens. The younger Arens, a research scientist at the University of\nSouthern California, said the ADL kept a file on him in the 1980s presumably\nbecause he has criticized Israel's treatment of Palestinians.\n   \"The ADL believes that anyone who is an Arab American ... or speaks\npolitically against Israel is at least a closet anti-Semite,\" Arens said.\n   The ADL has denied any wrongdoing, but couldn't comment on the lawsuit\nbecause it hasn't reviewed it, said a spokesman at the ADL's New York\nheadquarters.\n   The FBI and local police and prosecutors are investigating allegations that\nthe ADL spied on thousands of individuals and hundreds of groups, including\nwhite supremacist and anti-Semitic organizations, Arab-Americans, Greenpeace,\nthe National Association for the Advancement of Colored People and San Francisco\npublic television station KQED.\n   Some information allegedly came from confidential police and government\nrecords, according to court documents filed in the probe and the civil lawsuit.\nNo charges have been filed in the criminal investigation.\n   The lawsuit accuses the ADL of violating California's privacy law, which\nforbids the intentional disclosure of personal information \"not otherwise\npublic\" from state or federal records.\n   The lawsuit claims the ADL disclosed the information to \"persons and\nentities\" who had no compelling need to receive it. It didn't elaborate.\n   Defendants include Richard Hirschhaut, director of the ADL's office in San\nFrancisco. He did not immediately return a phone call seeking comment.\n   Other defendants are San Francisco art dealer Roy Bullock, an alleged ADL\ninformant over the past four decades, and former police officer Tom Gerard.\nGerard allegedly tapped into law enforcement and government computers and passed\ninformation on to Bullock.\n   Gerard, who has retired from the police force, has moved to the Philippines.\nBullock's lawyer, Richard Breakstone, said he could not comment on the lawsuit\nbecause he had not yet studied it.\n\n\n\n\n\nUPwe 04/14 1956  ADL sued for allegedly spying on U.S. residents"},{"role":"assistant","content":"talk.politics.mideast"}]}

Rags strewed the mud floor around an \n iron tripod over embers that vented their smoke through roof beams black \n with soot. All looked bare and empty, but in an inner room flies buzzed. As \n the door swung shut behind me I saw they came from a man's body lying face \n up, naked but for its grimy turban. He was about fifty years old by what \n was left of his face - a rifle butt had bashed an eye. The one left slanted, \n as with Tartars rather than with Turks.

He yawned.\n 'Did you see any Turk officers?'\n 'No, sir. I was in at dawn. All were Tartar civilians in mufti.'\n\n \"The lieutenant dozed off, then I, but in the small hours a voice woke me - \n Dro's. He stood in the starlight bawling out an officer. Anyone keelhauled\n so long and furiously I'd never heard. Then abruptly Dro broke into \n laughter, quick and simple as child's. Both were a cover for his sense\n of guilt, I thought, or hoped. For somehow, despite my boast of irreligion,\n Christian massacring 'infidels' was more horrible than the reverse would\n have been.\n\n From daybreak on, Armenian villagers poured in from miles around.....\n The women plundered happily, chattering like ravens as they picked over\n the carcass of Djul. They hauled out every hovel's chattels, the last \n scrap of food or cloth, and staggered away, packing pots, saddlebags, \n looms, even spinning-wheels.\n\n 'Thank you for a lot, Dro,' I said to him back in camp. 'But now I must \n leave.'...We shook hands, the captain said 'A bientot, mon camarade.' And \n for hours the old Molokan scout and I plodded north across parching plains. \n Like Lot's wife I looked back once to see smoke bathing all, doubtless in \n a sack of other Moslem villages up to the line of snow that was Iran.'\"\n\np. 354.\n\n\"At morning tea, Dro and his officers spread out a map of this whole\n high region called the Karabakh. Deep in tactics, they spoke Russian,\n but I got their contempt for Allied 'neutral' zones and their distrust\n of promises made by tribal chiefs. A campaign shaped; more raids on\n Moslem villages.\"\n\np. 358.\n\n\"It will be three hours to take,\" Dro told me. We'd close in on three\n sides.\n\"The men on foot will not shoot, but use only the bayonets,\" Merrimanov\nsaid, jabbing a rifle in dumbshow.\n\"That is for morale,\" Dro put in. \"We must keep the Moslems in terror.\"\n\"Soldiers or civilians?\" I asked.\n\"There is no difference,\" said Dro. \"All are armed, in uniform or not.\"\n\"But the women and children?\"\n\"Will fly with the others as best they may.\"\n\np. 360.\n\n\"The ridges circled a wide expanse, its floors still. Hundreds of feet \n down, the fog held, solid as cotton flock. 'Djul lies under that,' said \n Dro, pointing. 'Our men also attack from the other sides.'\n\n Then, 'Whee-ee!' - his whistle lined up all at the rock edge. Bayonets\n clicked upon carbines. Over plunged Archo, his black haunches rippling;\n then followed the staff, the horde - nose to tail, bellies taking the\n spur. Armenia in action seemed more like a pageant than war, even though \n I heard our Utica brass roar.\n\n As I watched from the height, it took ages for Djul to show clear. A tsing\n of machine-gun fire took over from the thumping batteries; cattle lowed,\n dogs barked, invisible, while I ate a hunk of cheese and drank from a snow\n puddle. Mist at last folded upward as men shouted, at first heard faintly.\n The came a shrill wailing.\n\n Now among the cloud-streaks rose darker wisps - smoke. Red glimmered about\n house walls of stone or wattle, into dry weeds on roofs. A mosque stood in\n clump of trees, thick and green. Through crooked alleys on fire, horsemen\n were galloping after figures both mounted and on foot.\n\n 'Tartarski!' shouted the gunner by me. Others pantomimed them in escape\n over the rocks, while one twisted a bronze shell-nose, loaded, and yanked\n breech-cord, firing again and again. Shots wasted, I thought, when by\n afternoon I looked in vain for fallen branch or body. But these shots and\n the white bursts of shrapnel in the gullies drowned the women's cries.\n\n At length all shooting petered out. I got on my horse and rode down toward\n Djul. It burned still but little flame showed now. The way was steep and \n tough, through dense scrub. Finally on flatter ground I came out suddenly,\n through alders, on smoldering houses. Across trampled wheat my brothers-in-\n arms were leading off animals, several calves and a lamb.\"\n\np. 361 (fourth paragraph).\n\n\"Corpses came next, the first a pretty child with straight black hair, \n large eyes. She looked about twelve years old. She lay in some stubble \n where meal lay scattered from the sack she'd been toting. The bayonet \n had gone through her back, I judged, for blood around was scant. Between \n the breasts one clot, too small for a bullet wound, crusted her homespun \n dress.\n\n The next was a boy of ten or less, in rawhide jacket and knee-pants. He \n lay face down in the path by several huts. One arm reached out to the \n pewter bowl he'd carried, now upset upon its dough. Steel had jabbed \n just below his neck, into the spine. \n\n There were grownups, too, I saw as I led the sorrel around. Djul was \n empty of the living till I looked up to see beside me Dro's German-speaking \n colonel.

A common reaction among \nnew bikers (or bicycle riders) in an emergency situation, is to steer the \nmotorcycle like a bicycle. As we know this makes the motorcycle go in the\ndirection opposite to what was intended. Needless to say, this is dangerous.\nI have a specific example: A rider in a left turn. The rider thinks he/she\nis to close to the right shoulder of the road, and tries to steer the \nmotorcycle to the left by pulling the left handle and pushing the right \nhandle. The motorcycle straightens up and goes off the road. \nA worse scenario: The same rider, same turn. In the middle of the turn\nthe rider sees a truck coming towards him/her. The panicking rider tries\nto steer the motorcycle away from the truck and crashes right into it.\n\nThe main function of a riding course is to teach how to avoid emergency \nsituations, AND what to do if in one.

Christian people have caused\n\"objective morality\" to look very \"relative.\"  After all, that was the\npoint of the original question in this thread, i.e. can we toss out\nChristianity because it is so obviously inconsistent with its own\nprinciples?  If you will bear with me, I will attempt to explain this\napparent inconsistency from at least one Christian's viewpoint:\n\nIf God exists and is the creator of mankind as the Bible claims, then\nHe has a pretty well-defined concept of what makes people tick\nphysically, emotionally, etc.  GOD has an \"objective\" morality for us.\nThat is to say, He has no trouble understanding what is good for (or\ndetrimental to) the creature He created. \n\n\tGalatians 2:10-- For we [mankind] are His workmanship, created in\n\tChrist Jesus for good works [a morality], which God prepared\n\tbeforehand [a well-defined design], that we might walk in them.\n\nHowever, contrary to what many people assume (including the Pharasees\nof the Bible,) God's morality cannot be completely codified in a list\nof rules and regulations.  To some extent, every activity of a\nperson's life creates a new situation to which morality must be\napplied.  There never could be enough volumes to codify God's\n\"objective\" morality for us. \n\nThroughout history, mankind has tried to reduce morality to a list of\nrules (objectivity, if you please.)  In the Old Testament, we have\nboth principles and specific rules.  By the time of Jesus, most of the\nprinciples were obscured by the emphasis men had placed on the rules.\nVolumes of additional rules had been made to try to codify the\napplication of the principles.  We [mankind] weren't comfortable with\nthe \"subjectivity\" of principles. \n\n\tFor reference see Matthew 5 where Jesus explains the difference\n\tbetween the Law and the principles of the Law.  For example, in\n\tverses 21-22:  \"You have heard that the ancients were told,\n\t'You shall not commit murder'...and 'Whoever commits murder shall\n\tbe liable to the court.'  But I say to you that everyone who is\n\tangry with his brother shall be liable to the court...\"\n\nThe \"objective morality\" of God gets blurred by our inept\ninterpretation of it.  We [Christians] have made our biggest errors\nwhen we have allowed any one person or group of people decide EXACTLY\nwhat God intended for us.  If we [Christians] would stay committed to\nseeking God's will instead of trying to prove we already had it all\nfigured out, we might do a better job of allowing others to find God's\n\"objective morality\" for themselves.  If Jesus is who he said he\nwas/is (and that's the fundamental question,) then HE IS \"objective\nmorality.\" "},{"role":"assistant","content":"talk.religion.misc"}]}

Most important - you reminded us of a\nprime engineering principle - undoubtably one you learned from the\ngeneration before you - the generation that built transcontinental\naviation in the 1920's and 30's - build a little and test a little\nand Max, you passed all of this on  to people like Pat Ladner who\nstarted this program for the SDI.\n\n     Douglas Aircraft didn't start with a DC-10.  They didn't even\nstart with a DC-3.  Our grandfathers built a little, tested a\nlittle - even sold a little and made a little money - before they\nmoved on to the next step.  They didn't take a decade or more\nbefore putting the first \"rubber on the road.\"  Max Hunter - you\ndidn't take ten years to build Thor, and by God we're not going to\ntake ten years to show that low cost, single stage, reusable\naerospace transportation is real.\n\n     We ended the cold war in a few short years.  It took the  same\nteam here today but a few years to show through the Strategic\nDefense Initiative that the cold war must end.  We - you and us -\nlaunched a series of satellites - The Delta experiments - in about\na year apiece.  This, more than anything else signaled our\ncommitment to end the impasse between ourselves and the Soviet\nUnion.  Those who made the decisions on both sides have underscored\nthe importance of our work in bringing about a new international\nrelationship.\n\n     But it is the same team which is now  putting in place the\nframework for an aerospace expansion that is our legacy for the\nnext generation.  We will make space access routine and affordable.\n\n     We built this magnificent flying machine in two years.  This\nsummer a true rocket ship will take off and land on earth for the\nfirst time.  Then we can and surely will build in the next three\nyears a reusable sub-orbital rocket.  It will allow us to use space\nrapidly, affordably, and efficiently as no other nation can.  And\nyes - we'll make a little money off it too!\n\n     Then - and only then - we'll spend another three years to\nbuild a fully reusable single stage to orbit system.  The DC-3 of\nspace will be a reality!  We may even be able to use some of the\nrocket propulsion breakthroughs of our former cold war adversaries. \nWhat a wonderful irony if this SDI product and Russian efforts to\ncounter SDI merge to power mankind's next step to the stars!\n\n     To be sure, we must guard against the temptations to leap to\nthe final answer.  Robert Goddard's first rockets weren't Saturn\nV's!  If we succumb  to the temptation to ask  for just a few extra\ndollars and a few more years to jump immediately to a full orbital\nsystem - we will fail.  Max Hunter and his colleagues showed the\nway.  Three years and a cloud of dust - in our case rocket\nexhausts.  There is no short-cut.  If we expect to reshape the\nworld again - we must do it one brick at a time.  Minds on tasks at\nhand!"},{"role":"assistant","content":"sci.space"}]}

I'm going to\ndispel the propaganda that the DEA is putting out by showing\nyou the drug war's *real* status. To help prove my assertions\nI've also posted two articles from USA Today that clearly\ndemonstrate that drug use among certain age groups *is* on the\nrise.  If WOD is working, as we're led to believe, then drug\nabuse should have gone down substantially by now.  The reality\nis, is that it has not gone down very much.  If anything,\nsubstance abuse is on the rise.  I'm also going to supply a\npossible solution to this problem.\n\nThe following text is an excerpt from an article about rock music\nand pot entitled \"Hello Again, Mary Jane\" which appears in the\ncurrent issue of Time magazine (April 19, 1993, p. 59).\n\n    Law-enforcement officials say pot advocates are just blowing\n    smoke when they talk about the comeback of the weed.  \"Perhaps\n    because of the change of administrations, the marijuana lobby\n    is out in full force,\" says Robert Bonner, head of the Drug\n    Enforcement Administration.  \"The fact is, they're losing the\n    battle.\"  In 1985 more than 23% of youths ages 12 to 17 said\n    they smoked marijuana; in 1991 that figure was 13%, and Bonner\n    says it is still falling.  Bonner also offers a reminder that\n    studies confirm such marijuana health risks as destruction of\n    nerve cells in the brain and lung damage.\n\nThe chart that follows was taken from the Wednesday, April 14, 1993\nissue of USA Today (\"Drug Use Up Among U.S. Eigth-graders\" by Mike\nSnider, p. 6D).\n\n    Adolescents' choices\n\n    Drugs used by eighth graders in the last month:\n                      Estimated, per 100 students\n                             1991     1992   Pct. chg.\n    Alcohol                  25.1     26.1        +4%\n    Cigarettes               14.3     15.5        +8%\n    Marijuana                 3.2      3.7       +16% \n    Amphetamines              2.6      3.3       +27%\n    LSD                       0.6      0.9       +50%\n    Cocaine                   0.5      0.7       +40%\n    Crack                     0.3      0.5       +67%\n\n    Source:  University of Michigan Institute for Social Research,\n    1993 report\n\nWe are not winning the \"war on drugs\".  I think you can see that one\nof the tactics that the DEA employs to give people the impression that\nthe \"war on drugs\" is being won is to selectively quote statistics---\nonly statistics that support their contention that drug use has gone\ndown.  The excerpt from Time magazine that I included in this post is\nan excellent example of how organizations like the DEA attempt to\ndeceive the public.\n\nUsage of *one* particular drug may have gone down but at the same\ntime usage of other drugs may have gone *up* (a.k.a. substitution).\nAlso, drug usage among *one* particular age group may have gone down\nbut drug usage among another age group may have gone *up*.  Therefore,\nif one takes a look at the big picture, taking into consideration *all*\nthe statistics, then it's obvious that the so-called \"war on drugs\" is\nbeing lost.  Perhaps the drug war is being won as far as illegal drugs\ngo, but if one factors in alcohol abuse, smoking, and use of inhalants,\nthen the magnitude of the drug problem in this country can then placed\nin its true perspective.\n\nFor those of you who don't consider alcohol to be a drug then try\ndrinking a fifth of whiskey sometime and then come back and tell me\nthat it's not a drug.  Agencies like the DEA only go after *illegal*\ndrugs.  This is one of the reasons why the drug war is a fruitless\nattempt at preventing substance abuse---people will merely switch to\nanother drug if the one they were using becomes scarce or unpopular.\n\nThe solution to the drug abuse problem in this country may be to\nlegalize some---not all---drugs whose toxicity has been shown to be\nwithin reasonable limits (you won't drop dead after using it a few\ntimes) and then couple this with a massive drug education program.\nThe reason why I think legalization is *part* of the solution is\nbecause people seem to be able to easily obtain drugs despite the\ngovernment's efforts to the contrary---the money spent on drug\ninterdiction could be spent more effectively elsewhere (e.g., drug\neducation).  Additionally, legalization would reduce crime because\nthe profit motive would be taken out of drug trafficking which often\ngoes along with other kinds of crime.  Not to mention the fact that\naddicts would have less reason to prey on innocent people for their\nmoney and posessions in order to support their expensive habit;\nlegalization would cause the street price of drugs to fall\nsubstantially so drugs would be much more affordable to addicts.\n\nIMHO, the way to reduce substance abuse is to do to drugs what has been\ndone to smokers:  make drug use socially unacceptable rather than try to\nemploy heavy-handed law enforcement and punish people by incarcerating\nthem.  As you already know, people in the U.S. smoke a lot less than\nthey used to.  This reduction in the number of smokers has been brought\nabout by public awareness campaigns, laws restricting where people can\nlight up, warning labels on cigarette packages, taxation on tobacco in\norder to reduce consumption, and so on.  I propose that similar methods\nbe used to reduce substance abuse after legalization has been carried\nout.  They are as follows:\n\n    * Drugs being sold must come with clear, concise information which\n      states the possible health hazzards involved with using this\n      product and recommendations on how the drug should be used.\n      Things like dosage levels and how long the drug should be used\n      ought to accompany the packaging the drug is contained in.\n\n    * All drugs should be taxed at a rate that generates a lot of\n      revenue but not so high as to encourage people to acquire drugs\n      through illegal channels.  Part of the revenue collected from\n      drug taxes should be used to fund drug education and law\n      enforcement.\n\n    * Make it a felony to sell drugs to minors (people under the age of\n      18).  Anyone can sell drugs but they must not dodge paying the\n      taxes on drugs or sell drugs with the warning information absent.\n      Failure to pay the appropiate taxes on drugs or omitting warning\n      information should also be a felony.\n\n    * Establish a government agency whose job is to insure that the\n      purity and safety of all drugs is as high as possible.  This\n      agency would try to prevent people from getting a hold of bad\n      drugs---something that is a fairly serious problem now.\n\nI'm sure that many of the things I've discussed in this article have\nbeen hashed out before in this newsgroup.  Nevertheless, I thought\nit was a good idea to give my two cents (actually a buck and a half...)\nall at once so you could get a good idea of where I currently stand on\nWOD.  Go ahead and tear into my post; I'm sure there is something in it\nthat you may wish to take a different view on or flame. :) :) :)  BTW,\nI posted the articles from USA Today to not only help prove my\nassertions but also to provide information on LSD usage among youths---\nsomething which I noticed some posters to this group were interested in.\n\nScott Kennedy,  Brewer and Patriot"},{"role":"assistant","content":"talk.politics.misc"}]}

Neil Schulman\n\nIf you wanted to know all about the Big Bang, you'd ring up Carl Sagan,\nright ?  And if you wanted to know about desert warfare, the man to call\nwould be Norman Schwarzkopf, no question about it.  But who would you call\nif you wanted the top expert on American usage, to tell you the meaning\nof the Second Amendment to the United States Constitution ?\n\nThat was the question I asked A.C. Brocki, editorial coordinator of the Los\nAngeles Unified School District and formerly senior editor at Houghton\nMifflin Publishers -- who himself had been recommended to me as the\nforemost expert on English usage in the Los Angeles school system.  Mr.\nBrocki told me to get in touch with Roy Copperud, a retired professor\njournalism at the University of Southern California and the author of\n\"American Usage and Style: The Consensus.\"\n\nA little research lent support to Brocki's opinion of Professor Copperud's\nexpertise.\n\nRoy Copperud was a newspaper writer on major dailies for over three decades\nbefore embarking on a a distinguished 17-year career teaching journalism at\nUSC.  Since 1952, Copperud has been writing a column dealing with the\nprofessional aspects of journalism for \"Editor and Publisher\", a weekly\nmagazine focusing on the journalism field.\n\nHe's on the usage panel of the American Heritage Dictionary, and Merriam\nWebster's Usage Dictionary frequently cites him as an expert.  Copperud's\nfifth book on usage, \"American Usage and Style: The Consensus,\" has been in\ncontinuous print from Van Nostrand Reinhold since 1981, and is the winner\nof the Association of American Publisher's Humanities Award.\n\nThat sounds like an expert to me.\n\nAfter a brief telephone call to Professor Copperud in which I introduced\nmyself but did not give him any indication of why I was interested, I sent\nthe following letter:\n\n\"I am writing you to ask you for your professional opinion as an expert in\nEnglish usage, to analyze the text of the Second Amendment to the United\nStates Constitution, and extract the intent from the text.\n\n\"The text of the Second Amendment is, 'A well-regulated Militia, being\nnecessary for the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep\nand bear Arms, shall not be infringed.'\n\n\"The debate over this amendment has been whether the first part of the\nsentence, 'A well-regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a\nfree State', is a restrictive clause or a subordinate clause, with respect\nto the independent clause containing the subject of the sentence, 'the\nright of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.'\n\n\"I would request that your analysis of this sentence not take into\nconsideration issues of political impact or public policy, but be restricted\nentirely to a linguistic analysis of its meaning and intent.  Further,\nsince your professional analysis will likely become part of litigation\nregarding the consequences of the Second Amendment, I ask that whatever\nanalysis you make be a professional opinion that you would be willing to\nstand behind with your reputation, and even be willing to testify under\noath to support, if necessary.\"\n\nMy letter framed several questions about the test of the Second Amendment,\nthen concluded:\n\n\"I realize that I am asking you to take on a major responsibility and task\nwith this letter.  I am doing so because, as a citizen, I believe it is\nvitally important to extract the actual meaning of the Second Amendment.\nWhile I ask that your analysis not be affected by the political importance of\nits results, I ask that you do this because of that importance.\"\n\nAfter several more letters and phone calls, in which we discussed terms for\nhis doing such an analysis, but in which we never discussed either of our\nopinions regarding the Second Amendment, gun control, or any other political\nsubject, Professor Copperud sent me the follow analysis (into which I have\ninserted my questions for the sake of clarity):\n\n[Copperud:] \"The words 'A well-regulated militia, being necessary to the\nsecurity of a free state,' contrary to the interpretation cited in your\nletter of July 26, 1991, constitutes a present participle, rather than a\nclause.  It is used as an adjective, modifying 'militia,' which is\nfollowed by the main clause of the sentence (subject 'the right', verb\n'shall').  The to keep and bear arms is asserted as an essential for\nmaintaining a militia.\n\n\"In reply to your numbered questions:\n\n[Schulman:] \"(1) Can the sentence be interpreted to grant the right to keep\nand bear arms solely to 'a well-regulated militia'?\"\n\n[Copperud:] \"(1) The sentence does not restrict the right to keep and bear\narms, nor does it state or imply possession of the right elsewhere or by\nothers than the people; it simply makes a positive statement with respect\nto a right of the people.\"\n\n[Schulman:] \"(2) Is 'the right of the people to keep and bear arms' granted\nby the words of the Second Amendment, or does the Second Amendment assume a\npreexisting right of the people to keep and bear arms, and merely state\nthat such right 'shall not be infringed'?\"\n\n[Copperud:] \"(2) The right is not granted by the amendment; its existence\nis assumed.  The thrust of the sentence is that the right shall be\npreserved inviolate for the sake of ensuring a militia.\"\n\n[Schulman:] \"(3) Is the right of the people to keep and bear arms\nconditioned upon whether or not a well regulated militia, is, in fact\nnecessary to the security of a free State, and if that condition is not\nexisting, is the statement 'the right of the people to keep and bear Arms,\nshall not be infringed' null and void?\"\n\n[Copperud:] \"(3) No such condition is expressed or implied.  The right to\nkeep and bear arms is not said by the amendment to depend on the existence\nof a militia.  No condition is stated or implied as to the relation of the\nright to keep and bear arms and to the necessity of a well-regulated\nmilitia as a requisite to the security of a free state.  The right to keep\nand bear arms is deemed unconditional by the entire sentence.\"\n\n[Schulman:] \"(4) Does the clause 'A well-regulated Militia, being necessary\nto the security of a free State,' grant a right to the government to place\nconditions on the 'right of the people to keep and bear arms,' or is such\nright deemed unconditional by the meaning of the entire sentence?\"\n\n[Copperud:] \"(4) The right is assumed to exist and to be unconditional, as\npreviously stated.  It is invoked here specifically for the sake of the\nmilitia.\"\n\n[Schulman:] \"(5) Which of the following does the phrase 'well-regulated\nmilitia' mean: 'well-equipped', 'well-organized,' 'well-drilled,'\n'well-educated,' or 'subject to regulations of a superior authority'?\"\n\n[Copperud:] \"(5) The phrase means 'subject to regulations of a superior\nauthority;' this accords with the desire of the writers for civilian\ncontrol over the military.\"\n\n[Schulman:] \"(6) (If at all possible, I would ask you to take account the\nchanged meanings of words, or usage, since that sentence was written 200\nyears ago, but not take into account historical interpretations of the\nintents of the authors, unless those issues can be clearly separated.\"\n\n[Copperud:] \"To the best of my knowledge, there has been no change in the\nmeaning of words or in usage that would affect the meaning of the\namendment.  If it were written today, it might be put: \"Since a\nwell-regulated militia is necessary tot he security of a free state, the\nright of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be abridged.'\n\n[Schulman:] \"As a 'scientific control' on this analysis, I would also\nappreciate it if you could compare your analysis of the text of the Second\nAmendment to the following sentence,\n\n\"A well-schooled electorate, being necessary to the security of a free\nState, the right of the people to keep and read Books, shall not be\ninfringed.'\n\n\"My questions for the usage analysis of this sentence would be,\n\n\"(1) Is the grammatical structure and usage of this sentence and the way\nthe words modify each other, identical to the Second Amendment's sentence?;\nand\n\n\"(2) Could this sentence be interpreted to restrict 'the right of the people\nto keep and read Books' _only_ to 'a well-educated electorate' -- for\nexample, registered voters with a high-school diploma?\"\n\n[Copperud:] \"(1) Your 'scientific control' sentence precisely parallels the\namendment in grammatical structure.\n\n\"(2) There is nothing in your sentence that either indicates or implies the\npossibility of a restricted interpretation.\"\n\nProfessor Copperud had only one additional comment, which he placed in his\ncover letter: \"With well-known human curiosity, I made some speculative\nefforts to decide how the material might be used, but was unable to reach\nany conclusion.\"\n\nSo now we have been told by one of the top experts on American usage what\nmany knew all along: the Constitution of the United States unconditionally\nprotects the people's right to keep and bear arms, forbidding all\ngovernments formed under the Constitution from abridging that right.\n\nAs I write this, the attempted coup against constitutional government in the\nSoviet Union has failed, apparently because the will of the people in that\npart of the world to be free from capricious tyranny is stronger than the\nold guard's desire to maintain a monopoly on dictatorial power.\n\nAnd here in the United States, elected lawmakers, judges, and appointed\nofficials who are pledged to defend the Constitution of the United States\nignore, marginalize, or prevaricate about the Second Amendment routinely.\nAmerican citizens are put in American prisons for carrying arms, owning\narms of forbidden sorts, or failing to satisfy bureaucratic requirements\nregarding the owning and carrying of firearms -- all of which is an\nabridgement of the unconditional right of the people to keep and bear arms,\nguaranteed by the Constitution.\n\nAnd even the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), staunch defender of the\nrest of the Bill of Rights, stands by and does nothing.\n\nit seems it is up to those who believe in the right to keep and bear arms to\npreserve that right.  no one else will.  No one else can.  Will we beg our\nelected representatives not to take away our rights, and continue regarding\nthem as representing us if they do?  Will we continue obeying judges who\ndecide that the Second Amendment doesn't mean what it says it means but\nmeans whatever they say it means in their Orwellian doublespeak ?\n\nOr will be simply keep and bear the arms of our choice, as the Constitution\nof the United States promises us we can, and pledge that we will defend\nthat promise with our lives, our fortuned, and our sacred honor ?\n\n(C) 1991 by The New Gun Week and Second Amendment Foundation.\nInformational reproduction of the entire article is hereby authorized\nprovided the author, The New Gun Week and Second Amendment Foundation are\ncredited.

Modern analogies, such as the prize for a\nhuman powered helicopter face similar arguments.  There is little economic\nbenefit in such a thing.  The advantage comes in the new approaches developed\nand the fact that a prize will frequently generate far more work than the \nequivalent amount of direct investment would.

Features\n===========\n\nDMPEG/DMPLAY is another MPEG decoder/player for the PC:\n\n\n - decodes (nearly) the full MPEG video standard\n   (I,P,B frames, frame size up to at least 352x240 supported)\n\n - saves decoded sequence in 8 or 24bit raw file for later display\n\n - optional on-screen display during decoding (requires VGA)\n\n - several dithering options: ordered dither, Floyd-Steinberg, grayscale\n\n - color-space selection\n\n - runs under DOS, 640KB RAM, no MS-Windows required\n\n - very compact (small code / small data models, 16 bit arithmetic)\n\n - real time display of the raw file by a separate player for\n   VGA and many Super-VGAs\n\n...\n\n4. Technical information\n========================\n\nThe player is a rather straightforward implementation of the MPEG spec [1].\nThe IDCT is based on the Chen-Wang 13 multiplication algorithm [2]\n(not quite the optimum, I know). Blocks with not more than eight non-zero\ncoefficients use a non-separated direct multiply-accumulate 2D-IDCT\n(sounds great, doesn't it?), which turned out to be faster than a 'fast'\nalgorithm in this (quite common) case. Dithering is pretty standard. Main\ndifference to the Berkeley decoder (except for the fewer number of supported\nalgorithms) is the use of 256 instead of 128 colors, the (default) option to\nuse a restricted color-space and the implementation of a color saturation\ndominant ordered dither. This leads to a significantly superior quality of\nthe dithered image (I claim, judge yourself).\n\nRestricted color-space means that the U and V components are clipped to\n+/-0.25 (instead of +/-0.5) and the display color-space points are distributed\nover this restricted space. Since the distance between color-space points\nis thus reduced by a factor of two, the color resolution is doubled at the\nexpense of not being able to represent fully saturated colors.\n\nSaturation dominant ordered dither is a method by which a color, lying\nsomewhere between the points of the display color space, is approximated\nby primarily alternating between two points of constant hue instead of\nconstant saturation. This yields subjectivly better quality due to the\nlower sensitivity of the human viewing system to saturation changes than\nto hue changes (the same reasoning as used by the PAL TV standard to improve\non NTSC). The improvement is particularly visible in dark brown or redish\nareas.\n\n...\n"},{"role":"assistant","content":"comp.graphics"}]}

[*]\n\nSince your viewpoint is always the same, the routines can be hard-coded\nfor a particular vantage.  In my case, wall two's rising edge has a slope\nof 1/4. (I'm also using Mode X, 320x240).\n\nI've run into two problems; I'm sure that other readers have tried this\nbefore, and have perhaps formulated their own opinions:\n\n1) The routines for drawing walls 1 & 2 were trivial, but when I ran a\npacked->planar image through them, I was dismayed by the \"jaggies.\"  I'm\nnow considered some anti-aliasing routines (speed is not really necessary).\nIs it worth the effort to have the artist draw the wall already skewed,\nthus being assured of nice image, or is this too much of a burden?\n\n2) Wall 3 presents a problem; the algorithm I used tends to overly distort\nthe original.  I tried to decide on paper what pixels go where, and failed.\nHas anyone come up with method for mapping a planar to crosswise sheared\nshape?\n\nCurrently I take:\n\n  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16\n 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32\n 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48\n 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64\n\nand produce:\n            \n             1  2  3  4\n33 34 35 36 17 18 19 20  5  6  7  8\n49 50 51 52 37 38 39 40 21 22 23 24  9 10 11 12\n            53 54 55 56 41 42 43 44 25 26 27 28 13 14 15 16\n                        57 58 59 60 45 46 47 48 29 30 31 32\n                                    61 62 63 64\n\nLine 1 follows the slope.  Line 2 is directly under line 1.\nLine 3 moves up a line and left 4 pixels.  Line 4 is under line 3.\nThis fills the shape exactly without any unfilled pixels.  But\nit causes distortions.  Has anyone come up with a better way?\nPerhaps it is necessary to simply draw the original bitmap\nalready skewed?\n\nAre there any other particularly sticky problems with this perspective?\nI was planning on having hidden plane removal by using z-buffering.\nLocations are stored in (x,y,z) form.\n\n[*] For those of you who noticed, the top lines of wall 2 (and wall 1)\n*are* parallel with its bottom lines.  This is why there appears to\nbe an optical illusion (ie. it appears to be either the inside or outside\nof a cube, depending on your mood).  There are no vanishing points.\nThis simplifies the drawing code for objects (which don't have to\nchange size as they move about in the room).  I've decided that this\napproximation is alright, since small displacements at a large enough\ndistance cause very little change in the apparent size of an object in\na real perspective drawing.\n\nHopefully the \"context\" of the picture (ie. chairs on the floor, torches\nhanging on the walls) will dispell any visual ambiguity.\n\nThanks in advance for any help.\n"},{"role":"assistant","content":"comp.graphics"}]}

Speed good, power consumption fair.  Effectively\n\tobsolete now; use 74LS or later, except for a *very* few oddball\n\tfunctions like 7407 which are hard to find in newer families.\n\n74H\tModification of 74 for higher speed, at the cost of higher\n\tpower consumption.  Very obsolete; use 74F.\n\n74L\tModification of 74 for lower power, at the cost of lower speed.\n\tVery obsolete; use CMOS.\n\n74S\tLater modification of 74 for even higher speed, at some cost in\n\tpower consumption.  Effectively obsolete; use 74F.\n\n74LS\tCombination of 74L and 74S, for speed comparable to 74 with lower\n\tpower consumption.  Best all-round TTL now, widest variety of\n\tdevices.\n\n74F\tFast as blazes, power not too bad.  The clear choice for high\n\tspeed in TTL.  Availability and prices generally good.\n\n74AS\tFailed competitor to 74F, although a few 74AS parts do things\n\tthat are hard to find in 74F and thus are still useful.\n\n74ALS\tPossible replacement for 74LS.  Generally souped up.  Still fairly\n\tnew, availability and prices possibly a problem.\n\n74C\tFairly old family, CMOS devices with TTL pinouts.  Competed with\n\t4000 series, not too successfully.  Obsolete; use 4000 or newer\n\tCMOS 74 families.\n\n4000\t(Thrown in as the major non-74 non-ECL logic family.)  The old CMOS\n\tfamily, still viable because of *very* wide range of devices, low\n\tpower consumption, and wide range of supply voltages.  Not fast.\n\tVery forgiving and easy to work with (beware static electricity,\n\tbut that comment applies to many other modern logic families too).\n\tThere are neat devices in this family that exist in no other.  The\n\tclear choice when speed is not important.\n\n74HC\tA new attempt at 74-pinout CMOS.  Fast compared to old CMOS, power\n\tconsumption often lower than TTL.  Possibly a good choice for\n\tgeneral-purpose logic, assuming availability and affordability.\n\tCMOS logic levels, *not* TTL ones.  Beware very limited range of\n\tsupply voltages compared to older CMOS, also major rise of power\n\tconsumption at faster speeds.\n\n74HCT\t74HC with TTL logic levels.  Much the same comments as 74HC.  Read\n\tthe fine print on things like power consumption -- TTL compatibility\n\tin CMOS involves some compromises.\n\n10K\t(Thrown in for speed freaks.)  The low end of ECL.  Various sources\n\tclaim that it is *easier* to work with than super-fast TTL for\n\tserious high-speed work.  Less forgiving, though:  read and follow\n\tthe rules or it won't work.  Availability to hobbyists limited,\n\tcan be expensive.\n\n100K\t(For real speed freaks.)  Hot ECL.  Harder to handle than 10K, and\n\tinconvenient packages.  Much more useful datasheets, however.\n\nAs for compatibility between families:  the 74 families (except 74C and\n74HC) are all more or less logic-level compatible, but how many 74X devices\nyou can drive from one 74Y output varies enormously with X and Y.  You just\nhave to read the specs and do the arithmetic.  74C and 74HC are compatible\nwith the others with a bit of hassle.  4000 compatibility can be a bit of\nhassle or a lot of hassle depending on what supply voltage 4000 is using.\n10K or 100K to anything else is considerable hassle.\n\nMe?  I use 4000 and 74LS with a sprinkling of 74F.  74HC[T] and 10K are\ninteresting but I haven't used either significantly yet."},{"role":"assistant","content":"sci.electronics"}]}

However, are there any users out there \nwith experience with the database package called \"Approach\".  It has gotten\na number of very good reviews from the various mags. and it seems like it\nwould require less hardware overhead than Paradox.  I have ruled out Access\nbecause some aspects of it are extremely non-intuitive, e.g. requiring a\nfield to always have a value.  I like what I've seen of Paradox, but it\nseems like the resource requirements are greater than what I have (386/25 MHz,\n6 MB ram).\n\nSo, please provide me with your thoughts are \"Approach\", good and bad.  Thanks.\n"},{"role":"assistant","content":"comp.os.ms-windows.misc"}]}

The\nfacts are that less Iraqis died in the Gulf War than did civilians \nin any other war of comparable size this century!  This was due mostly\nto the short duration coupled with precise surgical bombing techniques\nwhich were technically possible only recently.\n\nThe idea that \"hundreds of thousands\" of Iraqi citizens died is\nludicrous.  Not even \"hundreds of thousands\" of Iraqi soldiers died,\nand they were the ones being targeted!  Or do you think that the US\nand its allies were specifically out to kill and maim Iraqi civilians?\nEither the smart bombs didn't hit their targets (and we know they did),\nor they were targeting civilian targets (!) which is hardly condusive to\ndestroying Iraq's military potential.  The military mission planners are\nnot fools, they know they have to hit *military* targets to win a war.\nHitting civilian targets does nothing but unite the people against you,\nnot a laudable goal if one wants the people to rise up against their\ntyrant-dictator. \n\nHow about all the innocent people who died in blanket-bombing in WW2?\nI don't hear you bemoaning them!  War is never an exact science, but\nwith smart bombs, it's becoming more exact with a smaller percentage\nof civilian casualties.  Sometimes mistakes are made; targets are\nmisidentified; innocents die.  That's war the way it really is.\nBut the alternative, to allow tyrannical dictators to treat the earth\nlike it's one big rummage sale, grabbing everything they can get is\nworse.  Like Patrick Henry said some 217 years ago, \"I know not what\ncourse others may take -- but as for me, give me liberty, or give me\ndeath!\"  War is always the price one must be willing to pay if one\nwishes to stay free.   \n\n\nMathew, your sarcasm is noted but you are completely off-base here.\nYou come off sounding like a complete peace-nik idiot, although I\nfeel sure that was not your intent.\n\nSo the Iraqi war was wrong, eh?  I'm sure that appeasement would have\nworked better than war, just like it did in WW2, eh?  I guess we\nshouldn't have fought WW2 either -- just think of all those innocent\nGerman civilians killed in Dresden and Hamburg.  How about all the poor \nFrench who died in the crossfire because we invaded the continent?  We \nshould have just let Hitler take over Europe, and you'd be speaking\nGerman instead of English right now.\n\nTyrants like Hussein *have* to be stopped.  His kind don't understand\ndiplomacy; they only understand the point of a gun.  My only regret is\nthat Bush wimped out and didn't have the military roll into Baghdad, so\nnow Hussein is still in power and the Iraqi people's sacrifice (not to\nmention the 357 Americans who died) was for naught.  Liberating Kuwait \nwas a good thing, but wiping Hussein off the map would've been better!\n\nAnd as for poor, poor Rodney King!  Did you ever stop and think *why*\nthe jury in the first trial brought back a verdict of \"not guilty\"?\nThose who have been foaming at the mouth for the blood of those\npolicemen certainly have looked no further than the video tape.\nBut the jury looked at *all* the evidence, evidence which you and I\nhave not seen.  When one makes a judgment without the benefit of a\ntrial where evidence can be presented on both sides, one has simply\nlowered himself to the level of vigilante justice, a state-of-mind\nwhich your sarcasm above seemingly spoke against, but instead tends\nto support in the case against the policemen.  \n\nLaw in this country is intended to protect the rights of the accused,\nwhether they be criminals or cops.  One is not found guilty if there is\na reasonable doubt of one's guilt, and only the jury is in a position\nto assess the evidence and render a verdict.  Anyone else is simply\nsuccumbing to verbal vigilantism.\n       \nRegards,"},{"role":"assistant","content":"alt.atheism"}]}

'the people' seems to have been a term of art employed in\n  select parts of the Constitution.  The Preamble declares that the\n  Constitution is ordained, and established by 'the people of the\n  the U.S.'  The Second Amendment protects the right of the people\n  to keep and bear Arms ....\"\n\t- Supreme Court of the U.S.,  U.S. v. Uerdugo-Uriquidez (1990).\n\nFurthermore, in the Miller decision, they only permitted prosecution\nfor possession of a sawed-off shotgun because the defense had not\npresented testimony and they therefore accepted the argument of the\ngovernment that such weapons have no military value -- they held that\nthe amendment protected the individual right to possess military\nweapons. Unfortunately, no second amendment case has successfully\ngotten to the court in fifty years. However, that does not change the\ninterpretation.\n\nFurthermore, it appears that others disagree with you as well, vis:\n\n \"The conclusion is thus inescapable that the history, concept,\n  and wording of the Second Amendment to the Constitution of the\n  United States, as well as its interpretation by every major\n  commentator and court in the first half-century after its ratifi-\n  cation, indicates that what is protected is an individual right\n  of a private citizen to own and carry firearms in a peaceful manner.\"\n   - Report of the Subcommittee on the Constitution of the\n     Committee on the Judiciary, United States Senate,\n     97th Congress, Second Session ( February 1982 )\n\nYou might rightfully ask \"well then, what does that first bit about\nmilitias mean?\"\n\nWell, \"militia\" in historical context basically means the whole of the\nadult males of the country. (Indeed, the U.S. Code still defines\n\"militia\" as all armed men over the age of 17).\n\n   \"The Militia comprised all males physically capable of acting\n    in concert for the common defense ....  And ... these men were\n    expected to appear bearing arms supplied by themselves and of\n    the kind in common use at the time.\"\n\t- Supreme Court of the United States,  U.S. v. Miller (1939).\n\nThe reason for the phrase being there was to explain the rationale\nbehind the amendment, which was this: by depending on the people to\nbear arms in defense of the country, no centralization of military\npower could ever occur which would permit tyranny -- in short, the\ngovernment would remain perpetually in fear of the people, rather than\nthe other way around.\n\n   \"No free man shall ever be debarred the use of arms.  The strongest reason\n   for the people to retain the right to keep and bear arms is, as a last\n   resort, to protect themselves against tyranny in government.\"\n     - Thomas Jefferson, Proposal Virginia Constitution, June 1776\n       1 Thomas Jefferson Papers, 334 (C. J. Boyd, Ed., 1950).\n\n   \"And what country can preserve its liberties, if its rulers are not\n   warned from time to time that this people preserve the spirit of\n   resistance ?  Let them take arms ... The tree of liberty must be\n   refreshed from time to time, with the blood of patriots and tyrants.\"\n     - Thomas Jefferson (letter to William S. Smith, 1787, in\n       Jefferson, On Democracy 20, S. Padover, ed., 1939).\n\n   \"Before a standing army can rule, the people must be disarmed;\n   as they are in almost every kingdom of Europe.  The supreme\n   power in America cannot enforce unjust laws by the sword;\n   because the whole body of the people are armed, and constitute\n   a force superior to any bands of regular troops that can be, on\n   any pretense, raised in the United States.\"\n     - Noah Webster, \"An Examination into the Leading Principles\n       of the Federal Constitution\" (1787), in Pamphlets on the\n       Constitution of the United States (P.

Mr. England wrote the \nfollowing as part of a book review section in This People's magazine (Spring \n1993 edition):\n\n  \"I conclude with a little sermon because I believe we will not be a Mormon--\n  or human--family until we can get over labeling and rejecting each other \n  with terms like feminist or patriarchal, liberal or conservative (Christian \n  or non-Christian -- Hal 8^).  When we are tempted to draw a circle around\n  a set of beliefs and traditions and styles and call it American, then exclude\n  those who don't fit, it may be well to consider that perhaps the most central\n  defining characteristic of a good American might be \"one who doesn't draw\n  exclusive circles\" -- that the surest way of excluding ourselves from the \n  central American ideal is by excluding others.  And when we are tempted to\n  draw a circle around \"Mormon\" or \"Christian,\" to decide who is \"orthodox\"\n  and who isn't by how much they agree with us, it might be well to consider\n  that the central pillar of Christ's \"orthodoxy\" is our ability to love\n  unconditionally those who are different and include them in our family.\n\n  \"I recently spent some time in a \"Christian\" bookstore in California. The\n  service was excellent, the clerks and customers all smiling, neat, and\n  well-scrubbed, and there were the expected wholesome offerings of scriptural\n  commentaries, sentimental fiction, and collections of evangelistic sermons.\n  But I was dismayed to find how much shelf space was given to attacking \n  others, often viciously---whether the political left, our modern American\n  culture, or other religions.  A whole section was devoted to \"Cults and the\n  Occult,\" and as you might expect, Mormonism was right there under the same\n  rubric and indictment (often by the same authors) as Satanism.  And I found\n  I could either rent or buy (in English or Spanish) copies of The God Makers\n  (that absurdly inaccurate, even libelous, but very popular and dangerous\n  anti-Mormon film that uses exaclty the same techniques and even accusations\n  of the Nazi films that scapegoated Jews in the 1930s).\n\n  \"It seems to me one major indication that a person is a genuine convert to\n  Christ and his redemptive love is his lack of paranoia and anxiety (\"Perfect\n  love casteth out fear,\" I John 4:18).  I have always been pleased that the\n  LDS Church has not engaged in attacks on other faiths, though I find a \n  disheartening increase in willingness of individual Mormons to engage in the\n  same kinds of stereotyping and scapegoating---and even threats of coercive\n  action---as the \"religious right wing\" has launched this year against the\n  political left and American cultural and religious styles they don't like.\n  It is a fearful irony that in so doing Mormons take common cause with the\n  very people who have most slanderously attacked Mormons---people who would,\n  if they had power, forcefully restrict Mormons' rights along with those of\n  others they believe to be evil.\"\n\n\nThe above \"sermon\" was addressed to the LDS audience who usually subscribe\nto This People's magazine, but would certainly apply to all of us who\nrely on the mercies and grace of Jesus Christ to bring us back into His\narms.  \n\nEven though the LDS Church claims devine authority to exercise the principles \nof the restored gospel---as in the days of Christ, the Church does not claim \nperfection and infallibility in how those with authoritative status have or do \nnow lead the Church.  I, for one, do not wish to be labelled \"Christian\", if \nthose who profess themselves as Christians attack my beliefs because they are \nintollerent (for example) of the way my religion may interpret Biblical \nscriptures of the same source to have a different meaning and implication \nthan mainstream Christianity would give it.  Once again, being in the \nmajority does NOT in and of itself PROVE anything except that your collective \nvoice is louder.  That's really all the critics of the LDS Church have to stand\non in terms of the kind of Biblical interpretation used as proof to counter \nthe LDS Church' interpretation!  Using someone elses biased research of truths \nand non-truths (whose to say what the mixture is?) as an authoritative tool to \ndisprove or discredit is not being fair to anyone, least of all themselves. \nLet us simply agree to disagree, and share beliefs through adult discussion \nand conversation, thereby uplifting everyone.  \n"},{"role":"assistant","content":"talk.religion.misc"}]}

EDT\n\n     THE PRESIDENT:  Good morning ladies and gentlemen.  It's\nan honor for me to welcome the University of Maine Black Bears, the\nwinner of the NCAA Division I hockey national championship to the\nRose Garden and the White House.  I understand from Senator Mitchell\nthat this is the first team from the University of Maine every to win\na national championship.  And we're glad to have them here.\n\n     I'm inspired not only by how the team pulled together to\nwin the championship, but how the entire state pulled together to\ncheer them onto victory.\n\n     Coming from a state that is also relatively small in\nsize, but also filled with pride and tradition and community, I can\nunderstand how the people of Maine must feel about the Black Bears.\nIn our state people are still talking about the time we won the\nOrange Bowl over the number one ranked football team, and that was\nback in 1978.  I'm sure that 15 years from now, the people of Maine\nwill as proud of this team as they are today.\n\n     You know, in my state football is a slightly more\npopular sport than hockey.  We don't have a lot of ice.  (Laughter.)\nBut after spending three months getting banged around in this town, I\ncan understand a little more about hockey than I did before I came\nhere.  Hockey is a tough game.  It's a hard-hitting sport.  It does\nhave one virtue though, there's a penalty for delay of game.  I wish\nwe had that rule in the Senate.  (Laughter.)\n\n     In government as in hockey, leadership is important.  In\nthe United States Senate, our team has a great captain, the Majority\nLeader and the senior Senator from Maine, George Mitchell; junior\nSenator -- Cohen looks so young, I can't imagine.  (Laughter.)  I'm\nactually bitter about Senator Cohen because he looks so much younger\nthan me.\n\n     On your hockey team, the captain Jim Montgomery has done\na great job.  He scored the winning goal late in the championship\ngame, leading you to a come-from-behind victory -- something else I\nknow a little bit about.\n\n     Sport brings out the best in individuals and in teams\nand in communities.  I share the pride that Senator Mitchell and\nSenator Cohen and Congressman Andrews and all the people of Maine\nmust feel for the Black Bears who have shown us all how to play as a\nteam, how to bring out the best in one another, and how to come from\nbehind.\n\n     I think it's important, as I ask young people from\naround America who have achieved outstanding things in working\ntogether, to come here to the White House to be recognized and\nappreciated by their country, to remember that those kinds of values\nand those kinds of virtues need to be ingrained in all of us for all\nof our lives.\n\n     We now have another role model, and I'm glad to have\nthem here today.  (Applause.)\n\n     (The President is presented with team jersey.)\n(Applause.)\n\n     THE PRESIDENT:  That's great.  I love it.  It's beautiful.\n(Applause.)\n\n     (The President is presented with an autographed stick.)\n\n     THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you.  That's great.  (Applause.)\n\n                             * * * * * *\n\n     Q  Mr. President, did you authorize the move on Waco\nthis morning, sir?\n\n     THE PRESIDENT:  I was aware of it.  I think the Attorney\nGeneral made the decision.  And I think I should refer all questions\nto her and to the FBI.\n\n     Q  Did you have any instructions for her as to how it\nshould be executed?\n\n     THE PRESIDENT:  No, they made the tactical decisions.\nThat was their judgment, the FBI.\n\n     Q  Is this a raid?\n\n     THE PRESIDENT:  And I will -- I want to refer you to --\ntalk to the Attorney General and the FBI.  I knew it was going to be\ndone, but the decisions were entirely theirs, all the tactical\ndecisions.\n\n     Q  What did you and Senator Mitchell talk about this\nmorning?\n\n     Q  Any chance for that stimulus package?\n\n     THE PRESIDENT:  Senator Mitchell ought to pay my\nquarter.  (Laughter.)  I was in there -- (laughter).\n\n     SENATOR MITCHELL:  You have to pay that quarter.\n\n     THE PRESIDENT:  I was ready.  (Laughter.)  Senator\nMitchell, he's worth a quarter any day.\n\n     Q  Any chance for your bill, sir?\n\n     THE PRESIDENT:  We talked about what was going to happen\nthis week in the Senate and about what other meetings we're going to\nhave for the rest of the week.  We only had about five minutes to\ntalk.  And we agreed we'd get back together later, around noon, and\ntalk some more.\n\n     Q  Senator Dole said over the weekend that your\ncompromise is no compromise.\n\n     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, I know he did, but, look, Senator\nDole and a lot of the other Republicans now in the Senate voted for\nthe same kind of thing for Ronald Reagan in 1983; and our research\nindicates that a majority of them over time voted for a total of 28\nemergency spending measures totalling over $100 billion when Reagan\nand Bush were President, in those administrations.  And many of those\npurposes were not nearly as worthy as putting the American people\nback to work.  I don't want to go back and revisit every one, but you\n\n\ncan do it.  You can look at the research there.  So this position\nthey're taking is not credible.  We have a very tough five-year\ndeficit reduction plan.  All these costs are covered during that time\nand then some.  And the very people that are saying this has all got\nto be paid for don't have much of a history on which to base their\nposition.  They've got 12 years of vote for stimulus measures of this\nkind that had very little to with putting the American people back to\nwork.  So I think we've got a chance to work it out, and I'm hopeful.\nWe'll see what happens today and tomorrow.  I'm feeling pretty good\nabout it.\n\n     THE PRESS:  Thank you\n\n                                 END       10:10 A.M. EDT\n\n -30-\n"},{"role":"assistant","content":"rec.sport.hockey"}]}

I think this may be something that Ford has corrected since \nthe initial batch of cars.  Also, someone said that Ford has issued a \nservice bulletin to inform dealers about how to correct this problem, so you \nmay be able to get your dealer to fix it.\n\n\nHaven't seen any of these problems, nor have I seen these mentioned on the\nmailing list, so these might just be having bad luck with these.\n\n\nDefinitely!\n\n\nNo problems like these either.  I haven't been able to find any obvious \nplaces where they screwed up.\n\n\nHmmm!  I got two keys with my car.  Something tells me you got stiffed by\nyour dealer on this.  (Actually, if you count the \"credit card\" key that \ncame in the owner's binder, I got 3 keys, but since the credit card key\ndoesn't have any teeth cut in it yet, I guess I won't count it. :-))\n\n\nThe latter is probably because of the air bag.  It's pretty much takes up\nall the space where you'd expect to find the horn.\n\nSpeaking of the horn, I was surprised to find that the Probe comes with one\nof those nice 'merican sounding horns instead of the Japanese sounding kind.\nThe previous Probes had Japanese horns.\n\n\nYeah, not very badly, but enough to be annoying sometimes.\n\n\nI agree strongly with all of the above, especially about the engine.  The\ninterior is very, very nice too.  Very pleasing to the eye, and ergonomically\nsound.\n\n...\n\nYes, this car's stiff suspension isn't for everyone.  I personally like it,\nbut if you find it a little harsh but otherwise like the car, I'd strongly\nsuggest looking into the MX-6.\n\n\nThe problem with the back seat is that there's no leg room.  Plenty of \nhead room, though.  Shorter people fit back there without any complaints,\nso long as the seat they are sitting behind is pulled forward a bit to \ngive them a place to put their feet.\n\n\nThe power moonroof can greatly improve the ventilation throughout the car. :-)\nI really enjoy the moonroof, by the way, but then I've always been a sucker\nfor open air driving.  No leakage problems or anything like that...yet!\n\n\nI haven't heard about this one.  I know that some of the very early Probes\n('89 and maybe '90) had problems with prematurely rusting mufflers (which\nFord will replace at no charge), but I haven't heard about anything like\nthis concerning the '93 Probes.\n\nI haven't had any real trouble with this car outside of a CV joint boot\nthat was leaking, but the dealer took care of that promptly, and even\ngave me a free rental car for the day and a half that I was without my\ncar.  I was quite happy with the way they handled...especially considering\nthat I was expecting the worst from them!\n\nFrom what I've heard, it sounds like Ford/Mazda had some QC problems with \nthe Probe (and probably MX-6) when they first went into production, but \nI think these problems have mostly been corrected at this point.  That's\nalmost always to be expected with a completely new car like this, though.\n\nHope this helps,\n\n-chuck-"},{"role":"assistant","content":"rec.autos"}]}

Jamie Navarro pitched\nseven strong innings, but Orosco, Austin, Manzanillo and Lloyd all took part\nin the mockery of a bullpen yesterday. How's this for numbers? Maldanado has\npitched three scoreless innings and Navarro's ERA is 0.75. The next lowest\non the staff is Wegman at 5.14. Ouch!\n\nIt doesn't look much better for the hitters. Hamilton is batting .481, while\nThon is hitting .458 and has seven RBI. The next highest is three. The next\nbest hitter is Jaha at .267 and then Vaughn, who has the team's only HR, at\n.238. Another ouch. Looking at the stats, it's not hard to see why the team\nis 2-5. In fact, 2-5 doesn't sound bad when you're averaging three runs/game\nand giving up 6.6/game. \n\nStill, it's early and things will undoubtedly get better. The offense should\ncome around, but the bullpen is a major worry. Fetters, Plesac and Austin gave\nthe Brewers great middle relief last year. Lloyd, Maldanado, Manzanillo, \nFetters, Austin and Orosco will have to pick up the pace for the team to be\nsuccessful. Milwaukee won a number of games last year when middle relief either\nheld small leads or kept small deficits in place. The starters will be okay,\nthe defense will be alright and the hitting will come around, but the bullpen\nis a big question mark.\n\nIn other news, Nilsson and Doran were reactivated yesterday, while William\nSuero was sent down and Tim McIntosh was picked up by Montreal.

If anyone serves Me, him My Father will honor.\"\n\nWhy would I want an eternal life if I hate this one?\n\nIf we were created by a deity, why would that deity not wish us to\nenjoy what he has given us?\n\nWhy would I want to live forever?  The challenge in my life is that I\nwill die, and that I must give my life the meaning I wish it to have\nbefore that happens.  My time is here and will someday pass; I will be\ncontent to live on in the memories of my friends, and once they too\nare dead, then I will no longer have any reason to exist.\n\nIn short: even if your deity *does* exist, that doesn't automatically\nmean that I would worship it.  I am content to live my own life, and\nfend for myself, so when I die, I can be proud of the fact that no\nmatter where I end up, it will be because of *my* actions and *my* choices.\n\nIf your god decides to toss me into a flaming pit for this, then so be\nit.  I would much rather just cease to exist.  But if your god wants\nmy respect and my obedience, then it had better earn these; and if it\ndoes, then they will be very strong and true.\n\n\nJesus wasn't the only one who rose from the dead -- I think it was\nOsiris who did the same, as well as a few characters from Greek or\nNorse legend, if memory serves.\n\nBut still: WHY would I want to rise from the dead?

Truth is, it's not.  Robert has never\ndemonstrated that he actually understands what the verses imply; he\njust rattles them off day by day.  Some brazenly fly in the face of\ncommon sense and reality, and I point these out where I can.\n\nBut even more than that, even when Christians *do* try to explain the\nverses in their own words, they do so from a Christian point of view,\nwhich is that every human being would want to be a Christian if only\nhe or she understood the Christian message properly, and then all\nstrife and suffering on the earth would end.  Here's the problem with\nthat: substitute \"Moslem\" or \"Buddhist\" or \"Satanist\" instead of\n\"Christian\", and it means the same thing.\n\nChristanity is a very nice belief set around a very nice book.  But if\nyou want to make me believe that it has any bearing on the REAL WORLD,\nyou've got some convincing to do.\n\n\nAnd in my opinion, you're bumbling about blindly making up entities\nwhere there aren't any, and depriving yourself of a true understanding\nand enjoyment of your life.

{"messages":[{"role":"system","content":"You are a helpful assistant who can classify newsletters into the right categories."},{"role":"user","content":"There has been quite a bit of discussion about house wiring and grounding\npractices here.  A few points need to be clarified:\n\nThe Equipment GROUNDING conductor, Green, green with a yellow stripe, bare, or\nthe metal sheath or pipe of SOME wiring methods, is used as a safety ground, to\ncarry fault currents back to the circuit breaker panel, and to limit the\nvoltage on the metal case of utilization equipment or other metal objects.  It\nshould never (except for a few exceptions to be discussed later) carry the\nnormal operating current of a connected load.  Some equipment has filters in\nthe power supply which may cause some slight current flow through the grounding\nconductor.  \n\nMuch communications or audio equipment is sensitive to noise or slight voltages\non the grounding conductor, and may require special wiring of the grounding\nconductors to provide reliable operation  (\"orange\" outlets are often used for\nthis, with insulated grounding conductors wired back to the panel box, and in\nmany cases back to the service.  Anyone installing such a system should read\nboth the section on grounding in the National Electric Code and publications on\ninstalling quiet isolated ground systems.  The code requires the insulated\ngrounding conductors (green wires) to run with the current carrying conductors\nback to the panel box, and, if required, back all the way to the service\nentrance , where it is bonded to the service ground (water pipe or rod)  Many\nof these systems are installed illegally or unsafely, where they do not provide\na safe ground or a quiet ground or either. \n\nThe GROUNDED conductor of a circuit, often called the NEUTRAL, which is\nreferred to in the code as the \"identified\" conductor and is supposed to be\nwhite or natural grey.  This conductor is supposed to be connected to ground in\nmost electrical systems at a single point, generally at the service entrance\npanel.  This connection is through the Main Bonding Jumper.  (In many household\nservice panels, the main bonding jumper is actually a bonding screw which\nattaches the neutral busbar to the case of the panel)  \n\nThe Grounded conductor (neutral) is generally a current carrying conductor.  In\nthe case of a 120 volt circuit it is one of the two conductors completing the\ncircuit from the panel to the load device.  \n\nSince the grounded conductor (neutral) is only connected to the grounding\nconductor (bare or green) at the service entrance, if the load is any distance\nfrom the service and draws any significant current, there will be a small but\nmeasurable voltage between the grounded and grounding conductors at the load,\nunder normal operating conditions.  If you should (incorrectly) connect the\ngrounded (neutral) conductor to the grounding conductor at the load, some of\nthe neutral current will flow instead through the grounding conductor.  Since\nthere will now be current flowing through the grounding conductor, it will also\nno longer be quite at ground potential at the load end.  If the load equipment\nhas a metal case, which is connected to the grounding conductor through the \"U\"\nground plug, the metal case is now also no longer quite at ground potential. \nThe difference (under normal, non short-circuit conditions) may be only a few\ntenths of a volt, but it could also be a volt or two.  This normally does not\npresent a shock hazard.  \n\nHOWEVER, if you let the metal case of the grounded equipment come into contact\nwith an independently grounded object such as a water or gas pipe, a radiator,\na metal air conditioning duct or such, part of the neutral current will try to\nflow through this aalternate ground path.  If the contact is not solid, you\nwill get a significant arc (a low voltage, but possibly moderate current arc)\nUnder the wrong conditions, this arcing could start a fire.  It is possible in\nsome cases that the sneak ground current   could also flow through a wire of\ninadequate size, causing it to overheat.\n\nWith the incorrect non single-point grounding of the neutral, if there is a\nshort circuit from hot to neutral, the high short circuit current which may\nflow will cause a much higher voltage on the grounding conductor, which\nincreases the possibility for shock or fire.  \n\nAlso if you incorrectly multiply connect the neutral and ground, the voltage on\nthe ground system is seen as noise bu computer or audio equipment, often\ncausing malfunction.  I have spent some hours tracking down such shorts in\ntechnical facilities where they were inducing severe hum into equipment.\n\nThe Neutral is usually bonded to the ground at the distribution transformer as\nwell as at the service entrance of each dwelling.  This is done primarily for\nlightning protection, so that induced lightning currents have a short path back\nto ground, and also to assure that the currents drawn by shorts to grounded\nobjects like pipes draw enough current to trip circuit breakers or blow fuses\nquickly.  The bad side of this is that not all the neutral current from the\ndwelling goes through the neutral wire back to the transformer.  Some of it\nflows through the grounding electrode (water pipe, etc.) this may cause\ncorrosion in the pipes and possibly in things like underground fuel oil tanks,\nand it may also cause measurable AC magnetic fields due to the large loop\nbetween the \"hot\" conductors in the service and the neutral current in the\nwater pipe and ground.  There are those who feel these fields may be unhealthy. \n(don't flame ME on this, I'm just telling you where the field comes from, not\nit's health effect, as far as I'm concerned, the jury is still out on this.)\n\nNote that the bonding jumper is only installed at the main panel, NOT at any\nsub distribution panels.  This is one reason why it is illegal to run service\nentrance cable with the sheath used as a neutral to a sub panel, you must have\na seperate insulated conductor for the neutral.  The sheath can be used in this\napplication only as the groundING conductor.  If the neutral is bonded to the\ngrounding conductor in the sub panel, say by forgetting to remove the bonding\nscrew, all the grounding conductors of the loads on that panel will be above\nground, with the possible problems listed above.\n\nThe code makes exceptions for ranges and dryers, as well as feeds from one\nbuilding to another.  In the cases of the range and dryer, the neutral may be\nused as the equipment ground under certain conditions, instead of a seperate\nwire.  Every time the code is revised, these exceptions come up for review. \nThese exceptions were, in fact the first required safety grounds, in the days\nbefore U ground outlets and such.  The appliance manufacturers don't want to\nhave to redesign their ranges and driers, and the contractors don't want to\nhave to run four wire cable (with four fairly heavy, expensive wires) in place\nof three wire to the appliances.  No question it would be safer with seperate\nneutrals to the stove, but the neutral current is low for most burner settings\n(since most current is in the 220 volt \"hots\" except at some low settings, the\nwires are large gauge, and there are few reported cases of injury or damage. \nSo far, the exceptions have survived. In the case of feeds between buildings,\nit's primarily for lightning protection.\n\nPeople doing wiring should be aware what is and what isn't a legal grounding\nconductor.  Obviously, the bare wire in \"romex\" 'with ground' is.  Anywhere\nthere is a green wire installed, such as in a portable cord, that is a good\ngrounding conductor.  The sheath of BX clamped in BX connectors in metal boxes\nis a legal grounding conductor (in the US). (BX has an aluminum band run under\nthe steel sheath to lower the resistance of the sheath.  You can just cut this\naluminum band off at the ends, you don't have to bond it to anything, it does\nits job by touching every turn of the BX sheath.) Conduit or EMT (thinwall\ntubing) is generally a legal grounding conductor, but may require a bonding\nlocknut where it enters a box or panel, particularly for larger pipes.  \n\n\"Greenfield\" (looks like big BX, but you pull your own wires in the empty\nsheath after you run it) is NOT a legal grounding conductor, as it doesn't have\nthe aluminum band to bond it, and the spiral steel has too much resistance and\ninductance.  You have to run a seperate green grounding conductor inside the\ngreenfield.\n\n\"Wiremold\" is also not a legal grounding conductor, as the paint on the boxes\noften prevents good contact, and the \"feed\" to the wiremold extension is often\nfrom a box in the wall that may not be well connected to the first wiremold\nbox.  I have personally discovered cases where the entire run of wiremold and\nthe cases of everything plugged into all the outlets on the run were \"hot\" with\n120 volts (Why do I get a shock every time I touch my computer and the radiator\nhere in the office?) because there was no ground wire in the wiremold and one\nof the outlets had shorted to the edge of the wiremold box.  You must run a\nground wire back in the wiremold from the outlets at least to the first box in\nthe original wiring (conduit, BX, etc.) where you can \"bond\" the wire to the\nbox with a screw, bnding clip, or whatever.\n\nOn another issue, while you should ground the green wire/lug on GCFI outlets\nwhen ever there is a place to ground them, it is legal in the NEC to use them\nwithout a ground if no ground is available.  It is better to have the\nprotection of the Ground fault interrupter than no protection if you don't\ninstall it.  The interrupter doesn't depend on the ground to trip.  It is\ndesirable to connect the ground if available, because if the ground is\nconnected, the interrupter will trip as soon as a faulty device is plugged in,\nwhereas without the ground, it will not trip until someone or something\nprovides a ground path.  For those questioning the legal use of ungrounded\nGCFI's, read in the NEC, 210-7 (d) exception. (This is the 1990 code, my '93\ncode is in the city, but I know the rule hasn't changed.  It might be\nrenumbered though.) \n\nWe have only touched the surface concerning grounding ;-} , there is much more\nto this subject, but most of you have fallen asleep by now.  \n\nJohn"},{"role":"assistant","content":"sci.electronics"}]}

Jewish religion was the foundation for Christianity and\nIslam.  In other words Judaism has fathered both religions. Now Islam has turned against its father I may say.\nIt is Ironic that after communizem threat is almost gone, religion wars are going to be on the raise. \nI thought the idea of believing on one God, was to Unite all man kind. How come both Jews and Islam which believe\non the same God, \"the God of Ebrahim\" are killing each other? Is this like Dr. Frankenstien's story?\nHow are you going to stop this from happening? How are you going to deal with so many Muslims. Nuking them \nwould distroy the whole world? Would God get mad, since you have killed his followers, you believe on the same\nGod, same heaven and the same hell after all? What is the peacefull way of ending this Saga?\n\n\nMan kind needs religion, since it sets up the rules and the regulations which keeps the society in a healthy state.\nA religion is mostly a sets of rules which people have experienced and know it works for the society.\nThe praying, keeps the sole healthy and meditates it. God does not care for man kinds pray, but man kind hopes\nthat God will help him when he prays.\nReligion works mostly on the moral issues and trys to put away the materialistic things in the life. But the \nreligious leaders need to make a living through religion? So they  may corrupt it, or turn it to their own way to\nmake their living. i.e Muslims have to pay  %20 percent of their income to the Mullahs. I guess the rabie  gets his\ncut too! \n\nIs in it that religion should be such that everybody on planet earth respects each other, be good toward each other\nhelps one another, respect the mother nature. Is in that heaven and hell are created on earth through the acts \nthat we take today?  Is in it that within every man there is good and bad, he could choose either one, then he will\nsee the outcome of his choice.  How can we prevent man kind from going crazy over religion. How can we stop\nanother religious killing field, under poor Gods name? What are your thoughts? Do you think man kind would\nto come its senses, before it is too late?\n\n\nP.S. on the side\n\nDo you think that Moses saw the God on mount Sina? Why would God go to top of the mountain? He created\nthe earth, he could have been anywhere? why on top the mountain? Was it because people thought to see God\nyou have to reach to the skies/heavens? Why God kept coming back to Middle East? Was it because they created\nGod through their imagination?  Is that why Jewish people were told by God, they were the chosen ones?\n\nProfit Mohammad was married to Khadijeh. She was a Jewish. She taught him how to trade. She probably taught\nhim about Judaism. Quran is mostly copy right of Taurah (sp? old testement). Do you think God wrote Quran?\nMakeh was a trade city before Islam. Do you think it was made to be the center of Islamic world because Mohammad\nwanted to expand his trade business? Is that why  God has put his house in there? \n\nI think this religious stuff has gone too far. All man kind are going to hurt from it if they do not wise up.\nLook at David Koresh, how that turned out? I am afraid in the bigger scale, the Jews and the Muslims will\nhave the same ending!!!!!!!!\n\nReligion is needed in the sense to keep people in harmony and keep them doing good things, rather than\nplotting each others distruction.

From a theological bent, those who lived\nimmediately after the flood, such as Noah, Ham, his son Cush, and his son\nNimrod had a much stronger appreciation of Divine wrath.  They also had a\nstronger understanding of the True God.  In fact, this immediacy was a cause of\nhardship for some, so much so that Atlas, who is seen with heavens resting on\nhis shoulders.  But this is not merely the physical heavens that he is lifting.\n It is to put God and the strict spirituality of His law at a distance, and\nthus he became the \"Elevator of the heavens.\"  This \"god\" made men able to\n\"feel\" as if heaven were afar off and \"as if either the God of Heaven could not\nsee through the dark cloud, or did not regard with displeasure the breakers of\nHis laws.\"  It is interesting to see that it was that was titled \"Emancipator\"\nor \"Deliverer\"  or Phoroneus. It was Nimrod who invaded the patriarchal system\nand abridged the liberties of mankind, yet was worship for having given many\nbenefits.  He was a deliverer all right but not as we think of Christ as a\nDeliverer.  One delivered from a conscious feeling of God's wrath, the other\nactually performed a delivery from Gods wrath and it is up to us to accept it\nas true.\n\n\nI don't see the problem.  From the time of Adam, those who looked forward to\nthe coming \"Anointed One\" and put their faith in the fact that it was God who\nwas to do the provision, were accounted as righteous.  But up to the\nCrucifixion, their sins were only covered, not taken away.  Therefore, the\ndispensation of the Church views the accountability of sin the same, but see it\nas a completed action.  Rom's makes it clear that it has always been salvation\nvia faith and nothing else.\n\n\nI understand what you're trying to convey, but I don't think I'd lay hold of it\nbecause the scriptures do equate the eternality of the second death with the\neternality of, say the Church ruling with Christ.  Jn 17 tells us what eternal\nlife is exactly, as you are correct that it is much more than non-cessation of\nconsciousness.  \n\n\nIt depends upon your def of \"lost.\"  The elect were lost only in time as\noutside of time they had been chosen from the foundation of the world. \nExistentially we were all born \"lost\", but the \"righteous\" were \"in Christ\" and\ntherefore never *assuredly* lost.  \n\nMaybe this summer I could find time to put together a paper on it.  I simply\nhave to buy more books for myself, and these older books are very expensive. \nEither that or countless trips to the oriental museum.\n\n\nCouldn't agree with you more.  Our understanding, of say eschatology, is\nclearly clearer than that of, say Isaiah.  But that is not what I was referring\nto.\n\n\n\nNo, I understand it as you have said. This was my point.\n\n\nAh!  This is it.  This is the big question.  However, I would say, again I\nthink, that the best lie is one that has an appreciable amount of truth to it. \nLook at Satan's twist of God's Word when he coerced Eve.  That is a very\ninteresting study.\n\n >The similarity in the midst of great variety of\n\nYes, that is my point.  But it is a two edged sword. For some do not want the\nunderlying reality to be revealed.  They were not known as \"mystery\" religions\nfor no reason.  There was the public side of them and there was the private\nside, that was so protected that the initiates to an oath of death if they\nrevealed that private side.  That is why it is so hard to bring their teachings\nto light. The \"Mystery of Iniquity\" that we find in the Bible, correlates to\nthis I think.  The primary object of the mysteries was to introduce privately,\nlittle by little, under the seal of secrecy and sanction of oath, what it would\nnot have been safe to openly profess was the true religion.  Case in point\ntoday might be the Masons.  (Just a note, that they too worshipped Osiris in\nEgypt, who can be traced to Nimrod, the \"husband son.\")\n\n\nNo, I disagree with you here Gerry.  I know what you're alluding to in that the\nchurch, primarily the RCC, did endorse Aristotelian philosophy into their\nworldview, but I would disagree with you that it originated in Greece.  If you\nare a student of history, you will come to see that much of what Greece came to\nexpound to the world as their original, was just an adulteration of that which\nthey had taken from conquered countries.  The soul is clearly mentioned and\ndiscussed at length in the Egyptian religions. As was the unity of God and also\nthe trinity of God.  See if you can find Wilkinson's \"Egyptians.\"  He really\ndoes a number on what the Greeks did to what they \"pilfered\" from the\nEgyptians. \n\n\nI'm not knocking Aristotle or Plato or any other Greek thinker.

Go shoot a revolver and a semi-auto like the\nColt .45. Does one fires faster than the other? Nope. Aside from which\nfaster rate of fire is usually not desirable. Sure it makes the other\nguys duck for cover, but just *YOU* trying hitting anything with a Thompson\nin hose-mode. This is why the military is limiting it's M-16 now to\n3-round burst-fire. Simple semi-auto would be better, but the troops\nlike to be able to rock and roll even if it is wasteful of ammo (something\noften in short supply when the enemy is plentiful).\n\nA revolver is equally capable as a semi-auto in the same caliber.\n\n- A revolver also has the advantage that if it misfires you just pull\n  the trigger again.\n- A double-action revolver (almost all of them) can be hand-cocked first,\n  but will fire merely by pulling the trigger.\n- A misfire in a revolver merely means you must pull the trigger again\n  to rotate to the next round.\n- A revolver can be carried with the 6th chamber empty and under the\n  hammer for maximum safety, but still can be drawn and fired with an\n  easy motion, even one handed.\n- Speedloaders for a revolver allow reloads almost as fast as magazines\n  on semi-autos. Can be faster depending on users.\n\n- A misfire in a semi-auto will require you to clear a jammed shell\n  first, time spent which can be fatal. And a vital second or so is often\n  lost as you realize \"hey, it's jammed!\" before starting to do anything\n  about clearing it.\n- Most semi-autos must have the slide worked to chamber the first round\n  and cock the hammer. Some police carry their semi-autos with the \n  chamber loaded and hammer cocked, but a safety engaged. I do not consider\n  this safe however. You must trade-off safety to get the same speed\n  of employment as a revolver.\n- There are some double-action semi-autos out there, but the complexity of\n  operation of many of them requires more training.\n\nSome police departments switched to Glocks, and then started quietly\nswitching many officers back to the old revolvers. Too many were having\naccidents, partly due to the poor training they received. Not that Glocks\nrequire rocket scientists, but some cops are baffled by something as complex\nas the timer on a VCR.\n\nAnyone who goes anyone saying that the criminals obviously outgun\nthe police don't know nothing about firearms. Turn off COPS and Hunter\nand pay attention. I do not seek here to say \"semi-autos are junk\"\nmerely that assuming they are better for all jobs is stupid. A cop\nwith a revolver on his hip and a shotgun in the rack is more than\nequipped for anything short of a riot.\n\nGun control is hitting what you aim at. If you whip out a \nwonder-nine and fire real fast you may find you don't hit anything.\nGood controlled fire from a revolver is more likely to get you a hit.\nI own a 9mm Beretta myself but consider it inferior as a carry weapon\nto something like the Ruger Security Six revolver. If I haven't hit\nwhat I'm aiming at in the first 5 shots, something is quite seriously\nwrong somewheres. While I might like having the backup capacity of those\nextra shots in certain cases, overwhelmingly the # of shots fired in\ncriminal encounters is less than 5.\n\nWhat do crooks overwhelmingly use in crime? Why the same nice simple\n.38 revolvers that the police often use.

As the load resistance increases, the RC constant decreases\nand hence the output voltage drops. I need as high an output\nvoltage as possible. (about 260v).\n  The circuit consists of seven voltage multiplier stages\n(ie 14 diodes and 14 capacitors) each capacitor develops about 38v\nacross them, and I take the output from across seven capacitors=260v.\n  Each capacitor is 100mfd at 68v.\n If I increase each of the capacitors rating (220-470mfd), that will\nincrease the RC constant, and hence alleviate some of the problem.\nThese capacitors are going to be a little expensive as I need 14 of\nthem, So:\n\n1. What would happen if I connected a 470mfd at 400v capacitor in parallel \nwith the output (and hence in parallel with the seven 100mfd capacitors)?\n  Will it, as I assume, increase the C in circuit and hence increase\nthe RC time constant?

Those key pressings\nthen go to XV and image has gone or something weird.\n\nIn the color editor, when I turn a color meter and release it, XV\nupdates the images.

I have sometimes tried to put myself\nin the feet of one of Jesus's disciples.  Basically, they gave up a\nlot --- career, possibly family, and well, a whole bunch, to follow\nJesus.\n\nSo what is the difference?  It is quite plain.  Jesus was good and\nDavid Koresh was not.\n\nThe problem is, I think, is that we try to legislate what is good\nand what is bad in terms of principles.  For instance, there are thousands of \nlaws in the U.S. governing what is legal and what is not.  Often, it is hard\nto bring people to justice, because it is not possible to find\na legal way to do it.  If only we could trust judges to be just,\nthen we could tell them to administer justice fairly, and justice\nwould be followed.  But since judges don't always get it right,\nwe have a complicated system involving precedent and bunches\nof other stuff which attempt to make the imperfect (the justice\nof man) into something perfect.  But what I hear about the justice\nsystem in the U.S. tells me that quite the opposite is true.\n\nThere is also a problem that we tend to judge the presentation\nmore than the material being presented.  So we might consider \na ranting Christian to be bad, but an eloquent person from another\nreligion to be good.  This goes along with the American desire\nto protect the Constitution at all costs, even if it allows\npeople to do bad things. \n\nI think that it is the message that is important.  If a man is\npresenting a false message, even if he is ever ever so mild mannered,\nthen that man is performing a tremendous disservice.\n\nI know that I am rambling here.  I guess that what I am trying to\nsay is that we shouldn't be looking for principles that tell us\nwhy the Davidians got it wrong.  It is not wrong to follow and\nworship a person.  But it is important to choose the right person.\nIt is simple.  Choose Jesus, and you got it right.  Choose\nanyone else, and you got it wrong.  Why?

Hits Stolen have been redefined as \"Plays Kurt\nStillwell would not have made.\"\n\nOK, I realize that's unfair.  Kurt's probably the victim of pitching staff,\nfluke shots, and a monster park factor.  But let's put it this way:  If we\nreplaced every second baseman in the NL with someone with Kurt's 57.6% out\nmaking ability, how many extra hits would go by?\n\nTo try and correlate it to reality a little more, I've calculated Net\nHits Stolen, based on the number of outs made compared to what a league\naverage fielder would make.  By the same method I've calculated Net Double\nPlays, and Net Extra Bases (doubles and triples let by).\n\nFinally, I throw all this into a a formula I call Defensive Contribution, or\nDCON :->.  Basically, it represents the defensive contribution of a player.\nI add this number to OPS to get DOPS (Defense + Onbase Plus Slug), which\nshould represent the player's total contribution to the team.  So don't\ntake it too seriously.  The formula for DCON appears at the end of this\narticle.\n\nThe short version -- definition of terms\nHS -- Hits Stolen -- Extra outs compared to Kurt Stillwell\nNHS -- Net Hits Stolen -- Extra outs compared to average fielder\nNDP -- Net Double Plays -- Extra double plays turned compared to avg fielder\nNEB -- Net Extra Bases --  Extra bases prevented compared to avg. fielder\nDCON -- Defensive Contribution -- bases and hits prevented, as a rate.\nDOPS -- DCON + OPS -- quick & dirty measure of player's total contribution.\n\nNational League\n\nname            HS   NHS   NDP   NEB   DCON    DOPS\nAlicea, L.      50    21    2    -1    .160    .865\nSandberg, R.   108    42    1     1    .134   1.015\nThompson, R.    65    20    5    -1    .104    .852\nLind, J.        66     8   -2     1    .027    .571\nDoran, B.       31    -1    4     0    .014    .705\nDeShields, D.   51     1   -2     1   -.002    .755\nHarris, L.      25    -4    0     1   -.019    .602\nLemke, M.       43    -1   -5    -5   -.038    .573\nMorandini, M.   37    -9   -6     0   -.069    .580\nRandolph, W.    13   -16    3    -1   -.088    .582\nBiggio, C.      34   -26   -4     0   -.091    .656\nStillwell, K.    0   -43   -3    -1   -.236    .336\n\nOrdered by DOPS\n\n1.015 Sandberg\n .865 Alicea\n .852 Thompson\n .755 DeShields\n .705 Doran\n .678 *NL Average*\n .656 Biggio\n .602 Harris\n .582 Randolph\n .580 Morandini\n .573 Lemke\n .571 Lind\n .336 Stillwell\n\nAmerican League\n---------------\n\nname            HS   NHS   NDP   NEB   DCON    DOPS\nFletcher, S.    59    18    5     1    .116    .811\nReed, J.        83    17    3     1    .071    .708\nRipken, B.      56     9   -1    -1    .044    .631\nBaerga, C.      67     0   10     0    .029    .838\nBlankenship, L. 34     2    2     1    .023    .757\nMiller, K.      34    -4    1    -1   -.016    .725\nAlomar, R.      62     4   -9    -2   -.020    .812\nKnoblauch, C.   50   -13    7    -3   -.024    .718\nBordick, M.     37    -4   -2    -1   -.025    .704\nKelly, P.       42    -1   -5    -1   -.039    .636\nWhitaker, L.    40    -8   -1    -2   -.041    .806\nReynolds, H.    47    -6   -5     1   -.043    .603\nSax, S.         56    -6   -9    -1   -.052    .555\nSojo, L.        28   -11   -3     0   -.075    .602\n\nOrder by DOPS\n\n.838 Baerga\n.812 Alomar\n.811 Fletcher\n.806 Whitaker\n.757 Blankenship\n.725 Miller\n.718 Knoblauch\n.708 Reed\n.704 Bordick\n.691 *AL Average*\n.636 Kelly\n.631 Ripken\n.603 Reynolds\n.602 Sojo\n.555 Sax\n\nMore discussion --\n\nDCON formula:  ((NHS + NDP)/PA) + ((NHS + NDP + NEB)/AB)\nWhy such a bizzare formula?
