It is sometimes\nused as a framework to view Scripture.  But if you look at Collosions,\nwithout going into it with the assumption that the Sabbath cannot be \na ceremonial law, you will see that it does refer to the sabbath.\n\nagainst us to His cross, and therefore we should not be judged in what\nwhat food we eat, what we drink, the keeping of new moons and holy days,\nor the keeping of the sabbath.\n\nThe word for sabbath in this verse is \"sabbaton\" and is used throughout the\nNew Testament to refer to the 7th day.  If there is any Scripture from\nwhich we get the idea of the ceremonial law, this is one of them, and the\nsabbath is listed among the ceremonial laws.\n\nIf one goes into this with the fundamental assumption \"the sabbath cannot\nbe a ceremonial law\" then he will have to find some way around it, like\nsaying that this can only refer to the other sabbath holy days besides the\n7tH day, Because \"the sabbath cannot be a ceremonial law.\"  But\nPaul is very careful in his letters to add some kind of parenthetcal \nstatement if there is anything that can be seen as a liscence to sin\nin his writings.\n\nAlso, why is the sabbath absent from the epistles (except for Hebrews 4, which\ntalks about the rest that comes through faith?)

Helmets have two major impact absorbing\nlayers... a hard outer shell and a closed-cell foam impact layer.\nMost helmets lose their protective properties because the inner liner\ncompacts over time, long before the outer shell is damaged or\ndelaminates from age.

According\n-> > to the Federalist Paper's, a well regulated militia has a well defined \n-> > structure and follows nationally uniform regulations.\n-> \n-> Perhaps you should actually READ the Federalist Papers!!\n\nPerhaps you should, reread Federal 29 which deals exclusively with the\n\"well regulated malitia.\"  Here is what is says about its character:\n\n\t To oblige the great body of the yeomanry, and of the other classes\n\t of the citizens, to be under arms for the purpose of going through\n\t military exercises and evolutions, as often as might be necessary to\n\t acquire the degree of perfection which would entitle them to the\n\t character of a well-regulated militia, \n\nIt also talks about the \"well regulated militia\" having a nationally\nuniform in structure and disipline.  \n\nI will note you did quote the end of this particular paragraph which states:\n\n    \tLittle more can reasonably be aimed at, with\n\trespect to the people at large, than to have them properly armed\n\tand equipped; and in order to see that this be not neglected, it\n\twill be necessary to assemble them once or twice in the course of\n\ta year.\n\nBut, do you knew how much organization is required to training a large\ngroup of poeple twice a year.  Just to try to get the same people\nevery year, provide a basic training to new people so they can\nbe integrated into the force, and find a suitable location, it \nrequires a continually standing committee of organizers.  \n\nSince a well regulate militia is nationally uniform in structure and\ndisipline, and meet once or twice a year to train, how can you claim\na \"well regulated militia\" is not well organized.  But I will concide \na \"well organized militia\" is not necessarily a \"well regulated militia.\" \n\nSeveral people have stated that the \"well organized militia\" is\nwhat is defined under 10 USC 311, which states\n\n\tThe militia of the United States consists of all able-bodied \n\tmales at least 17 years of age and, except as provided in \n\tsection 313 of title 32, under 45 years of age who are, \n\tor who have made a declaration of intention to become, \n\tcitizens of the United States and of female citizents of \n\tthe United States who are commissioned officers of the \n\tNational Guard.\n\nThis deos define the militia, but were is the adjective \"well regulated.\"\n10 USC 311 does not define a \"well regualed militia\" in any way, shape, \nor form.  It only defines who can become part of a well regulated militia\nThe Federalist Papers CLEARLY define the \"well regualed militia\" as a\nproper SUBSET of the militia.  In the same paragraph quoted above, it\ntalk above \"disciplining all the militia of the United States\" so they\nfit the \"character of a well-regulated militia.\"  This is what the\nparagraph states about the associated costs:\n\n\tIt would form an annual deduction from the productive labor \n\tof the country, to an amount which, calculating upon the \n\tpresent numbers of the people, would not fall far short \n\tof the whole expense of the civil  establishments of all \n\tthe States. To attempt a thing which would abridge the \n\tmass of labor and industry to so considerable an extent,\n\twould be unwise: and the experiment, if made, could not \n\tsucceed, because it would not long be endured.\n\n\nAnother quote provide by Charles Scripter is:\nJames Madison, Federalist Paper 41 (regarding the \"General Welfare\" clause): \n\t\"Nothing is more natural nor common than first\n\tto use a general phrase, and then to explain and qualify it by a\n\trecital of particulars.\"\n\nSo the phrase \"the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall \nnot be infringed\" must either qualify or explain the phrase \"a well \nregulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free state.\"  \nThe definition of \"explain\" as stated in \"The American Hertitage\nDictionary of the Enlish Language\" The New College Edition, 1982 is:\n\t1) To make plain or comprehensible; remove obscruity from;\n\t   elucidate: \"It was the economists who undertook to explain \n\t   this puzzle\"\n\t2) To define; explicate; expound: He explained his plan.\n\t3) To offer reasons for or a cause of; an answer for' justify:\n\t   explain an error\nThe second phrase clearly does not \"explain\" the first, therefore\nthe second phrase must \"qualify\" the first.  The definition given\nfor \"qualify\" is:\n\t1) To describe by enumerating the characteristics or qualities\n\t   of; characterize.\n\t2) To make competent or suitable for office, position, or \n\t   task.\n\t3) To give legal power to; make legally capable.\n\t4) To modify, limit, or restrict, as giving exceptions.\n\t5) To make less harsh or severe; moderate\n\t6) Grammar: To modify the meaning of (a word or phrase)\nSince \"the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be\ninfringed\" does not describe, modify or make less harsh anything and\nit has nothing to do with grammar or some sort of position or task.\nBy process of elimination it must fall into definition #3.  And since\n#3 deals with legal power, the same thing the Constitution does, it\nmust be the correct definition in this case.  Therefore, \"the right \nof the people to keep and bear Arms\" gives legal power to the \"well \nregualated militia\" and this legal power \"shall not be infringed\".  \n\nI thank you very much Mr Scripter, you have provided me with more \nevidence that the Second Amendment only concerns itseft with the \npeople's right to form well regulate militia, and says very little \nabout the right of an untrained person to \"keep and bear\" a .50 caliber\nmachine gun.  And since I, totally untrained in the use of any firearm\n(something I personly have meant to correct by going to a NRA gun\nsafety course and joining a gun club), cannot legally buy such a machine\ngun, I conclude the courts and democraticly elected congress agree with\nme.\n\n-> So now we know which category Mr. Rutledge is in; He means to destroy\n-> our Liberties and Rights.\n\nI mean \"to destory our Liberties and Rights.\"  Is that why a participate\nin the discussion of exactly what \"our Libertues and Rights\" are?  I \nforce my version of \"our Liberties and Rights\" by begining statements\nof what \"our Liberties and Rights\" with \"All that the Second Amendment \nclearly states to me.\"   Using expressions, such as \"states to me,\" \nclearly mean I intend to force my views on others?  I don't think so.\n\nSo in effort not to force my views and not \"to destory our Liberties and\nRights,\"  I state that nothing I have written, or will write, in\nthe matter of \"Liberties and Rights\" is the final word.

I've weathered attempted dog attacks before using the\napproved method: Slow down to screw up dog's triangulation of target,\nthen take off and laugh at the dog, now far behind you. This time, it\ndidn't work because I didn't have time. Riding up the hill leading to my\nhouse, I encountered a liver-and-white Springer Spaniel (no relation to\nthe Springer Softail, or the Springer Spagthorpe, a close relation to\nthe Spagthorpe Viking). Actually, the dog encountered me with intent to\nharm.\n\nBut I digress: I was riding near the (unpainted) centerline of the\nroughly 30-foot wide road, doing between forty and sixty clicks (30 mph\nfor the velocity-impaired). The dog shot at me from behind bushes on the\nleft side of the road at an impossibly high speed. I later learned he\nhad been accelerating from the front porch, about thirty feet away,\nheading down the very gently sloped approach to the side of the road. I\nsaw the dog, and before you could say SIPDE, he was on me. Boom! I took\nthe dog in the left leg, and from the marks on the bike my leg was\ndriven up the side of the bike with considerable force, making permanent\nmarks on the plastic parts of the bike, and cracking one panel. I think\nI saw the dog spin around when I looked back, but my memory of this\nmoment is hazy.\n\nI next turned around, and picked the most likely looking house. The\napologetic woman explained that the dog was not seriously hurt (cut\nmouth) and hoped I was not hurt either. I could feel the pain in my\nshin, and expected a cool purple welt to form soon. Sadly, it has not.\nSo I'm left with a tender shin, and no cool battle scars!\n\nInterestingly, the one thing that never happened was that the bike never\nmoved off course. The not inconsiderable impact did not push the bike\noff course, nor did it cause me to put the bike out of control from some\ngut reaction to the sudden impact. Delayed pain may have helped me\nhere, as I didn't feel a sudden sharp pain that I can remember.\n\nWhat worries me about the accident is this: I don't think I could have\nprevented it except by traveling much slower than I was. This is not\nnecessarily an unreasonable suggestion for a residential area, but I was\nriding around the speed limit. I worry about what would have happened if\nit had been a car instead of a dog, but I console myself with the\nthought that it would take a truly insane BDI cager to whip out of a\nblind driveway at 15-30 mph. For that matter, how many driveways are\nlong enough for a car to hit 30 mph by the end?\n\nI eagerly await comment.\n\nRyan Cousinetc.|1982 Yamaha Vision XZ550 -Black Pig of Inverness|Live to Ride\nKotRB          |1958 AJS 500 C/S -King Rat                      |to Work to\nDoD# 0863      |I'd be a squid if I could afford the bike...    |Flame to\nryan.cousineau@compdyn.questor.org  |   Vancouver, BC, Canada   |Live . . .\n\n\n * SLMR 2.1a * \"He's hurt.\" \"Dammit Jim, I'm a Doctor -- oh, right.\"\n                                                                                       "},{"role":"assistant","content":"rec.motorcycles"}]}

In 1974, Turkey had a democratic goverment and free\npress at that time.  Forget about internal news agencies, I haven't\nheard anything from any international source about any\nconcentration camps with Greek Cypriot prisoners in Turkey.\nHowever, I heard Adana POW camp.  It was not secret and well \nrecognized POW camp.  \n\nI see,  They vanished in Turkish labor camps.  Turks have\ndecided to acknowledge their existence first but later\nchanged their minds releasing them.  Is that it?  What do\nyou think happened to them?  I thought that MIA's are only the subject \nof Rambo and Chuck Noris movies.  Seems that I am wrong.\n\n\nYou don't need to belive me.  Turkiye was never a clandestine state\nin its history,  It has been a respected and continuous member of UN \nsince the inception of UN.  No body ever questioned the UN membership of\nTurkey because of what had happened in 1974a and after.  Only a short \nlived arms embargo was imposed unilaterally by USA to satisfy the \ninternal Greek loby.  I know what you would say next.  Let me answer it\nbefore wasting anytime.  Yes!  UN had a few condemning resolutions \nagainst Turkey because of handling the Cyprus problem, especially after\nthe 1980 coup.  Well, US and Israel had a few too.  What can I say?\nI am sure during Athens Junta duruing 1960-74, Greeks had\ntheir own share too.\n\n\nHave you looked at the latest UN agenda for Cyprus talks\nmediated by Gali?  There was no issue whatsoever about any\nmissing people among the negotiating parties.  was there?\nI heard many times from Denktas interviews by Turkish and\nInternational press.  He keeps saying that \"This was no\nlonger an issue for peace talks.\"  Also, you don't want\nme fish for the Greek Cypriot politician's words (that Argic\nhad posted zillion times) describing missing peoples as \na Greek-Cypriot myth.  Seems that there is a different opinions \namong Greek-Cypriots as well about missing people in Turkish \ncustody.\n\n[..]\n\n\nI am not claiming anything.  I just told you what was\ngiven to Greek Cypriots as an answer by Turkish\nGoverment/Turkish Cypriots when they wanted to locate some\nof their own between July 15 and the final cease-fire in\nlate August, 1974.  This answer seems to satisfy the international \ncommunity, the UN, and the Vasilu Goverment (since he did not make it\nan issue for the peace talks).  Also, I am not aware of any UN\ncondemnation against Turkey about any missing Greek-Cypriot.  Are you?  \n\nBTW, do you mean that Nicos Sampson had a bloodless coup d'eta\nand nobody got hurt in those events?  \n\n\nLike I said before.  There is even a different opinion among\nGreek-Cypriots for this myth.   The officers in Turkish Army who\ngoverned the Adana POW camp must be hell of clever dudes\nto cover up their tracks 8-).

Kings, revivals, Temples, and all.\n\nThe Torah, as far as I know, is the five books of Moses.  Then come the\nProphets (all the Prophets, plus Joshua, Judges, 1&2 Samuel, 1&2 Kings)\nand the Writings (Psalms, Proverbs, Lamentations, Ruth, Esther, Ezra,\nNehemiah, Ecclesiates, Song of Songs, 1&2 Chronicles, Job).\n\nAnd the veracity of Isaiah, which you quoted to your Moslem friend is\nquite well known.  A complete manuscript exists that dates back to past\n200 BC, and is kept in a Museum in Israel.  It was found among the Dead\nSea Scrolls, which greatly enhanced our knowledge of the veracity of the\nOld Testament, as they date back to around the time of Christ, whereas\nbefore, the oldest complete manuscript in Hebrew was from around 900 AD.\n\nYour Moslem friend is sorely mistaken, but understandably so.  If Jesus\nwas crucified, and atoned for our sins, he must have been God, for only\nthe death of God could atone for the sins of all humanity.  And as\nIsaiah predicts, the messiah will be called \"the mighty God.\"  And if he\nwas God, then he must have rose, for as St. Paul wrote, it was not\npossible that death could hold him.

A columnist for the St. \nPaul \"Pioneer Press\" wrote an article giving the \"inside scoop\" on the \nissue.  There are three local sites competing for a team and three possible \ncandiates to move to the Twin Cities.  First the sites: Target Center, Civic \nCenter (St. Paul), and yes, even the Met Center.  The columnist was pretty \nconfident that Minnesota will get a team, and that the Target Center will \nultimately win out.  He argued, however, that the competition from the other \ntwo sites will delay the process considerably.  Without the \ninter-site competition, the columnist (sorry, I can't remember his name) \nbelieves that Minnesota would have a team by the 1994-95 season.  Also, \nbecause of the situation with the Timberwolves, things will be delayed \nuntil (unless) the city of Minneapolis takes over the Target Center.  \nHowever, they are unlikely to do so until the Met Center is destroyed, \nbecause the city will lose money if there is competition from the Met for \nconventions and short-term events (even with hockey at Target).  To add to \nthis mess, a STUDY (6 to 12 months) is going to be conducted on the future \nviability of the Met Center, which obviously delays the process even \nfurther.  I hope that the study is cancelled, which will have the effect of \nknocking the Met Center out of the running and perhaps encouraging \nMinneapolis to take over the Target Center sooner. The city would be\nbe even more encourged if the wrecking ball is taken to the Met, \nwhich may happen.\n\tRegarding possible candidates, the three teams are \nHartford, Tampa Bay, and New Jersey.  I would prefer the Devils (Minnesota \"\nIce Demons?\") although the Lightning may have potential.  Although it hasn't \nbeen announced yet, it looks like 6 neutral site games will be played at the \nTarget Center next year.  Apparently the Devils are interested in playing in \nas many of those six games as possible, and I wouldn't be surprised to see \nHartford and Tampa show up there either.\tSo, Minnesota may end up \ngetting another team, but it may take a few years.\n\n\t\n\tGo Sabres!"},{"role":"assistant","content":"rec.sport.hockey"}]}

I moved there from\nNovosibirsk. My son entered the Baku Nautical School, and so I transferred\nto Azerbaijan. Later I met someone and married him, and now my name is\nArutunian, my husband's name . . .\n\nThat there would be a massacre was not discussed openly, but there were hints \nand gibes, so to speak, at the Armenian people, and they were mocking the \nRussians, too. I was constantly aware of it at work, and not just this past \nyear. I couldn't find a definite place for myself in the pool at work because \nI, I'll just say it, couldn't steal, couldn't deceive, and couldn't be \ninvolved in bribe-taking. And when I asked for decent working conditions they \ntold me, \"Leave, don't keep the others from working, you aren't cut out for \nthis kind of work.\" And at work and around all the time I would hear gibes at \nthe Armenians, like \"The Turks had it right, they killed them all--the way\nthey've multiplied here they're making it hard for us to live,\" and \"Things \nwill be just fine if we get rid of them all.\" \"No problem, the Turks will \nhelp,\" they say, \"if we ask them, they'll rid Armenia of Armenians in half an \nhour.\" Well that's the way it all was, but I never thought, of course that it \nwould spill over into a bloody tragedy, because you just couldn't imagine it. \nHere we've been living under the Soviet government for 70 years, and no one \neven considered such an idea possible.\n\nBut I had been forming my own opinions, and in the presence of authoritative \npeople I would often ask, \"Where is this all leading, do people really not see\nwhat kind of situation is emerging here. The Russians are fleeing Sumgait, \nthere are very few of them left. Why is no one dealing with this, what's going\non?\" And when it all happened on the 27th and 28th, it became clear that \neverything had been arranged by someone, because what else are you to make of \nit if the First Secretary of the City Party Committee is marching ahead of the\ndemonstration with an Azerbaijani flag? I wouldn't be saying this now if I \nhadn't received personal confirmation from him later. Because when we were \nunder guard in the SK club on the 1st, he came to the club, that Muslimzade. \nThe women told me, \"There he is, there he is, that's Muslimzade.\" I didn't \nbelieve the rumors that he had carried an Azerbaijani flag. I thought that \nthey were just false rumors. I went over to him and said, \"Are you the First \nSecretary of our City Party Committee?\" He answers me, \"Yes.\" And I ask him, \n\"Tell me, did you really march ahead of that gang carrying an Azerbaijani \nflag, and behind you they were carrying denigrating signs, I don't know \nexactly what they said, but there was mention of Armenian blood?\" And he tells\nme, \"Yes, I was there, but I tried to dissuade them from it.\" Then I asked him\nanother question: \"And where were you when they were burning and slaughtering \nus? And he said, \"I. . . We didn't know what to do, we didn't know, we didn't \nanticipate that that would happen in Sumgait.\"\n\nComrade Mamedov, the First Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the \nAzerbaijani SSR, answered the same question for me: \"No, we actually didn't \nanticipate the slaughter in Sumgait. At that time we were trying to contain \nthe crowd of 45,000 in Baku that was preparing for a massacre.\" Those are his \nexact words, the ones he said in the office of the Council of Ministers of the\nArmenian SSR.\n\nAnd now, about the events themselves. Of course it's painful to discuss them, \nbecause it may seem that it's not true to someone else. Various rumors \nconcerning what happened are making the rounds: some are true, others aren't. \nBut unfortunately there are more true ones than false, because it was so \nhorrible: in our age, here in the space age, the age of science, the age of\nprogress, I don't know, if someone had told me this story, if I were living in\nor around Moscow, I wouldn't have believed it. Why not? Because it was really \na genocide, it was a massacre. That's genuinely what it was.\n\nFor example, on that day, the 28th--I didn't know about the 27th because my \nhusband and I were both sick, both of us had the flu, and we were in bed--on \nthe 28th our neighbor comes to our place and says, \"You're in bed? You don't \nknow anything about it? There was a demonstration in town, and after it they \nwere overturning Armenian cars and burning them. They were looking into cars \nand asking, 'Are you an Armenian?' If they answered in Armenian, then they \nturned the car over and burned it.\" This isn't made up, the wife of the Senior\nInvestigator of the Baku Ministry of Internal Affairs told us. He was \nreturning home from his dacha with his wife, Raisa Sevastyanova, she's my \nneighbor. She immediately came and told LIS that they had landed right in the \nmiddle of it, I don't know what to call it, the cavalcade of automobiles they \nwere stopping. He answered in Azerbaijani, they let them go, but they made him\nhonk the horn, they were kicking up a fracas. We didn't even believe it, and \nI said, \"Certainly that didn't happen, how can that be?\" And she said, \n\"Muslimzade was leading the crowd, and the Sputnik store was completely\nsmashed because most of the salespeople there are Armenians. And when he saw \nthat they had started breaking the glass in that store, he said, \"Don't break \nthe shop windows, don't destroy state property, but do whatever else you want.\n\" I didn't hear this with my own two ears, but it is a fact that the store was\ntorn up and the director of the store was beaten for employing Armenians \nalthough he's an Azerbaijani.\n\nWhile we were talking, all of a sudden right across from us . . . Sevastyanova\nis the first to look out the window and say, \"Look, there's a crowd out \nthere.\" And sure enough, when we looked out there we saw that the crowd had \nalready started wrecking the neighboring building. There was an Armenian \nfamily there, a woman and two girls. They lived across from us. I'm sorry, I \ndon't know the building number or the people's names, since we were in my \nhusband's apartment, in Microdistrict 8, and I lived in Microdistrict No. 3. \nThere was awful looting going on there at the time, the most hideous things \nwere going on there then. One building there, ours, was attacked twice, once \nwasn't enough for them. They returned to the places where they hadn't finished\nthe Armenians off. If an Azerbaijani family dared to conceal Armenians, they \nbeat the Azerbaijanis too. They also beat Russians, if it was Russians doing \nthe hiding. Because there were Russians among them, they said so on \ntelevision, there were people of various nationalities. But they didn't tell \nus why there were people of different nationalities. Because they wouldn't \nhave touched the Azerbaijanis if they hadn't dared to stick up for the \nArmenians and give them temporary shelter in their homes.\n\nAt the time I saw this from the window I was there, Sevastyanova was there, \nand so was my husband. We went out onto the balcony and saw a television fly \noff a balcony. All kinds of things, even a sofa. Then, when it was all down \nthere, they burned it up. Then we saw the crowd, and they were all oohing. At \nfirst I couldn't figure out what was happening. And later I told my husband, \n\"Lendrush, l think they're beating someone out there.\" And he answered, \"I \ndon't know, could be.\" Suddenly the crowd separated for a moment, and I saw \nit, and Raisa Sevastyanova saw it too. My husband had turned the other way, \nhe didn't see it. I saw a naked girl with her hair down. They were dragging \nher. She kept falling because they were pushing her and kicking her. She fell \ndown, it was muddy there, and later other witnesses who saw it from their \nbalconies told us, they seized her by the hair and dragged her a couple of \nblocks, as far as the mortgage bank, that's a good block and a half or two \nfrom here. I know this for sure because I saw it myself.\n\nThen the crowd rushed toward our building. We were standing there, and you can\nof course imagine what we were feeling. Were they going to kill us or not? And\nI also had the awful thought that they might torment me the way they tormented\nthat woman, because I had just seen that.\n\nI asked my husband. I gave him an axe and said, \"You kill me first, and then \nlet them do what they want with the corpse.\" But our neighbors, it's true, \ndefended us, they said, \"There aren't any Armenians in our entryway, go away, \nonly Muslims live here.\" Disaster missed us that time.\n\nBut at two o'clock in the morning a crowd of about 15 people, approximately, \ncame back to our place. My husband was already asleep. He can sleep when he's \nupset about something, but I can't. I was standing, running from balcony to \nbalcony. Our power was out, I don't remember for how long, but it was as \nthough it had been deliberately turned off. There were no lights whatsoever, \nand I was glad, of course. I thought it was better that way. But then I look \nand the crowd is at our balcony. This was at 2:15 in the morning. The first \ntime they were at our building it was 6:30, and now it was 2:15 in the \nmorning. But I never thought that that old woman on the first floor, the \nAzerbaijani, was awake and watching out, there were human beings among them \ntoo. So she goes out with a pail of garbage, as though she needed to be taking\ngarbage out at two o'clock in the morning. She used it as a pretext and went \ntoward those young people. They really were youngsters. From my balcony you \ncould see perfectly that they were young Azerbaijani boys. They spoke \nAzerbaijani. And when they came up to her she said, \"What do you want?\" And \nthey answered, \"We want the Armenian family that lives here\" [pointing toward \nthe second floor with their hands]. She says, \"I already told you, we don't \nhave any Armenians here, now leave, do you hear, this is an old Muslim woman \ntalking to you,\" and grabbed the hand of one boy who was trying to walk around\nher and enter the building anyway and started pushing him away. And so they \nseemed to listen to her. They were all very young, they started apologizing \nand left. That was the second time death was at our door.\n\nI forgot to mention about one other apartment, a man named Rubik lives there, \nI don't know him really, I knew his daughter, I mean I saw her around, but we \nreally didn't know them. But I do know that that guy who lives on the fourth \nfloor across from our entryway went to Chernobyl and worked there for eight \nmonths, to earn money. Can you imagine what that means? He risked his life to \nearn X amount of money in order to better his family. He bought new furniture \nand was getting ready to give his daughter's hand in marriage, but, alas,\neverything was ruined by those creeps and scoundrels. They threw everything \nout the windows, and the rest we saw from our balcony: how the neighbors on \nthe left and right ran into the apartment and carried off everything that \nhadn't already been smashed or taken. What is one to think of that? It means \nthat the parents in those families were in on it too. Unfortunately I came to \nbe of the opinion that it was all organized and that everything had been \nforeseen in advance: both the beating of the Armenians and the stripping of \napartments. Something on the order of \"We'll move the Armenians out and take \nover their apartments.\"\n\nI have worked honestly my whole life, you can check everything about me. I \ncame as a patriot from China, waited for nights on end in front of the \nConsulate General of the USSR, I came to my homeland as a patriot because I \nknew that the Party and the Komsomol were holy things. But when I saw in \nSumgait that there wasn't anything holy about them, that Party membership was \nbought, that Komsomol members joined only for personal gain, that there were \nno ideals, no ideas, God save me, everything was being bought and sold, I saw \nall of it and understood how they could allow that crap to go on like it did.\n\nI can't talk any more about it . . . the image of that beating . . . When I\nwent out of my own apartment--they picked us up under Soviet Army guard, they \nhad arrived from all over to suppress that gang--not only Armenians, but some \nRussian families and their children, too, came out of their apartments and\njoined us, because no normal person who had seen that could stay there with \nthe situation the way it was. And what's interesting is that when we left on \nthe buses I rode and thought that at least one group of people, for sure \npeople would basically rise to the situation, would have some compassion for \nthe Armenians, would somehow understand the injustice of what was done. But \nhaving analyzed and weighed the whole thing, once I calmed down, having \nthought it all through, I came to a conclusion that is shared by many people. \nIf a lot of Azerbaijanis didn't want their Armenian neighbors to be killed, \nand that basically depended on that Muslimzade--he said that he had wanted to \ncalm them down--then is it possible that he didn't have people at hand to whom\nhe could whisper at the last minute, \"Go and announce it on television: \nCitizens of Sumgait! Take what you can into your hands, let's protect our \nneighbors from this massacre?\" Those crowds weren't such that there was no \ncontrolling them. Basically they were unarmed. They didn't have firearms, \nmostly they had knives, they had all kinds of metal parts, like armature \nshafts, sharpened at the ends, special rocks, different to a degree that we \nnoticed them: there aren't rocks like those in Sumgait soils, they were \nbrought from somewhere, as though it were all specially planned. So as I was \nsaying, I weighed it all out and if any of our neighbors had wanted to defend \nus, why wasn't it arranged? It means that the government didn't want to do \nit. When the crowd was moving from the City Party Committee to the Sputnik, \nwhat, there was no way of informing Baku? No, there was no way, it turns out!\nThe crowd was doing violence in our microdistrict. I won't mention the things \nI didn't see myself, I'll only talk about the things I myself witnessed. They \nwere in Microdistrict 8 beginning at 6 o'clock in the evening, when I saw them\nfrom the other building, and they were somewhere else until mid-night or one \no'clock in the morning, because at 2:15 they came back to our building. They\nhadn't completely finished making their predatory rounds of Microdistrict 8. \nWhen they returned to our building I told my husband, \"Lendrush, now the \npolice are probably going to come, my God, now the authorities are probably \ngoing to find out and come to our aid.\" Well, alas, no, there were to be no \nauthorities, not a single policeman, not a single fireman, not a single \nambulance came while they were raging, as it turns out, as we later found out,\nbeginning on the Might of the 27th. There were dead people, ruined apartments,\nand burned autos: one car near the bus station, it was burned and overturned, \nit was probably there about four days, everyone saw it and what went on in \nBlock 45! Those who live there know, they saw from their balconies how they \nattacked the soldiers in the buses, how they beat those poor, unarmed\nsoldiers, and how on that square, I can't remember the name of it, where there\nis that fork coming from the bus station, that intersection, now I'm upset and\nI can't think of the name . . . there's a tall building there, a 9-story, and \nfrom the balconies there people saw that butchery, when the poor soldiers, \nwearing only helmets, with shields and those unfortunate clubs, moved against \nthat mob. And when they fell, those 12-to 14-year-old boys ran up and using \nstones, big heavy stones, beat them to death on their heads. Who could have \nguessed that something like that could happen in the Soviet Union and under \nthe Soviet government? The upshot is that this republic has not been under \nSoviet control for a long time, but no one wanted to pay any attention or get \ninvolved.\n\nIf you were to go and ask at my work many people would confirm that I tell the\ntruth, I've been struggling for truth for five years there already, the five \nyears that I worked at the Azerbaijani railroad. Some people there considered \nme a demagogue, others who knows what; some think I'm an adventure seeker, and\nsome, a prankster. But I wanted everything to be right, I would become\noutraged: how can this be, why is it people treat one another this way on a \nSoviet railroad, as though the Azerbaijani railroad were Azerbaijani property,\nor the property of some magnate, or some \"mafia\": If I want to, I'll get you \nout of here; If I want to, I'll get rid of you; If I want to, I'll do \nsomething else? And there's a black market price for everything, in the most \nbrazen way: a coach to Moscow costs so much, a coach on a local train costs so\nmuch. Once when I was complaining to the head of the conductor's pool, he had \nthe nerve to tell me, maybe you won't even believe this, but this, I'm afraid,\nI heard with my own ears: \"Tatyana, just how long can you fight for something\nthat you know will never have any effect? You're alone against everyone, so \ninstead why don't you give more money to the chief conductor, and everything \nwill go fine for you.\" I started to cry, turned, and left. What else could I \ndo, where else could I go to complain? I realized that everything was useless.\nAnd the root of the whole thing is that it all goes on and no one wants to see\nit. I filed a written complaint, and they ground it into dust, they destroyed \nit, I still have a copy, but what's the use? When the General Procuracy got \ninvolved with the investigation of the bloody Sumgait affair, in addition to \nthe information about what I saw, what I was a witness to, I gave testimony \nabout the mafia at the railroad. They accepted my petition, but I don't know \nif they're going to pursue it or not. Because, you'll excuse me, I no longer \nbelieve in the things I aspired to, the things I believed in before: It's all \ndead. They just spit on my soul, stomped on everything, physically, and most \nimportant, spiritually, because you can lose belongings, that's nonsense, that\nall comes with time, but when your soul is spit upon and when the best in \nyou--your beliefs--are destroyed, it can be very difficult to restore them...\n\nI want to tell of one incident. I just don't know, at the time I was in such a\nstate that I didn't even take minor things into account. Here is an example.\nOf course, it's not a minor one. My neighbor, Raisa Sevastyanova, she has a\nson, Valery, who is in the 9th grade in a school in Microdistrict 8. A boy,\nVitaly [Danielian], I don't know his last name, goes to school with him, or\nrather, went to school with him. I was just sitting in an apartment trying to\nmake a phone call to Moscow . . . Oh yes, and there's one important detail:\nWhen the massacre began, for two to three hours the phones weren't working in \nArmenian apartments, and later, in several Russian and Azerbaijani apartments.\nBut the fact of the matter is that service was shut off, you could not call \nanywhere. Why? Again, it means it was all planned. How come service is cut off\nfor no reason? And the lights went off. And those brats were raging as they\nliked They weren't afraid, they ran about freely, they that no one would slap \ntheir hands and no one would dare to stop them.  They knew it.\n\nNow I'm going to tell about the incident. So this little Vitaly, Vitalik, an\nArmenian boy, went to school with Valery; they were in the same class. \nAccording to what Valery and his neighbor pal said--at the time I was in the\nsame apartment as they were, I sat at the phone waiting for the call to be put\nthrough--a mob attacked the building where Vitalik lived. So Valery ran to\nhis mother and said, \"Mamma, please let me go to Vitalik's, what if they kill\nhim? Maybe he's still alive, maybe we can bring him here and save him somehow.\n. . . He's a nice guy, we all like him, he's a good person, he's smart.\" His \nmother wouldn't let him go. In tears, she says, \"Valery, you can't go because \nI am afraid.\" He says, \"Mamma, we can get around the crowd. We'll just watch, \njust have a look.\" They made it through. I don't know, I think Vitalik's\nparents lived in Microdistrict No. 1, and when they got there, they made a \nsuperficial deduction. Knowing that balconies and doors were being broken \neverywhere, that you could see from the street which were the Armenian \napartments in the building, they went here and there and looked, and saw that \nthe windows were intact, and so they calmed down. But even though the windows \nin that apartment were not broken, everything inside was totally smashed, and \nVitalik lay there with a broken skull, and his mother and father had already \nbeen murdered. Little Vitalik didn't even know they were dead. So two weeks \nago, I don't know, he was in critical condition, no, maybe it was longer: we \nleft Sumgait on March 20, spent some time in Moscow, and then we came to \nYerevan. So it's been about a month already; it's so hard to keep all this \nstraight. So Valery, the next day, when he found out that Vitalik's family has\nbeen killed and Vitalik was ling in the Semashko Hospital in Baku, Valery and\nhis classmates got together and went to visit him. But they wouldn't admit \nthem, telling them that he was in critical condition and that he was still in \na coma. They cried and left, having also found out that the girl I saw being \nkicked and dragged was in that hospital too. As it turns out she was brought \nthere in serious condition, but at least she was alive at the time . . .\n\nWhen we got to the SK club we would see first one friend and then another, \nthrow ourselves into their arms and kiss them, because you had wondered if \nthese friends were alive or not, if those friends were alive or not  . . . And\nwhen you saw them you were so glad to find out that the family had lived! When\nyou saw people you heard things that made your hair stand on end.\n\nIf you publish everything that happened it will be a hideous book. A book of \nthings it is even difficult to believe. And those two girls who were raped \nwere entirely black and blue, the ones at the SK, they know I'm not lying, \nthat girlfriend came up to one of them and said, \"What happened?\" and she \nbared her breasts, and they were completely covered in cigarette burns . . . \nthose rogues had put cigarettes out on her breasts. After something like that \nI don't know how you can live in a city and look at the people in it.\n\nNow . . . When we stayed at the military unit for a while, they provided,\nwell, basic conditions for us there. The military unit is located in Nasosny,\nsome six miles from Sumgait. And living there we met with a larger group\nof people. There were about 1,600 people at the unit. You know, there was a\npoint when I couldn't even go outside because if you went outside you saw\nso much heartbreak around you. And when you hear the false rumors . . .\n\nYes, by the way, false rumors were spread in Sumgait saying that the Armenians\naround Yerevan had destroyed Azerbaijani villages and razed them to the ground\nwith bulldozers. I didn't know whether to believe it or not. And people who \ndon't know any better get the idea that it was all done in revenge. But when \nI arrived in Armenia and was in Spitak, and in Spitak all those villages are \nnot only intact, but at that time had even been protected just in case, they \nwere guarded, they got better food than did the inhabitants of Spitak. Not a \nsingle person there died, and no one is planning to harm them. Around Yerevan \nall the villages are safe and unharmed, and the Armenians didn't attack \nanyone. But actually, after an evil of the magnitude suffered in Sumgait there\ncould have been a feeling of vengefulness, but no one acted on it. And I don't\nknow why you sometimes hear accusations to the effect that the Armenians are \nguilty, that it is they who organized it. Rumors like that are being spread in\nAzerbaijan. And if one old person says it and ten young ones hear it, they not\nonly perceive it with their minds, but with their hearts, too. To them it \nseems that the older person is telling the truth. For example, one says; \"Did \nyou know that out of 31 people killed (by the way, originally they said 31 \npeople, but later they found a 32nd), 30 were Azerbaijani and one was an \nArmenian?\"\n\nOf course I'm upset, but it's utterly impossible to discuss such things and\nnot become upset. Sometimes l forget things, but I know I want to return to\nthe time when we were in the SK club across from the City Party Committee.\nWhen I saw Muslimzade in the SK club building I went to him to ask because I \ncouldn't believe that he had marched in the front carrying a banner. I already\nmentioned this, and if I repeat anything, please excuse me. I asked him, \"Why \ndid you do that and why are you here now, why did you come here? To laugh at \nthese women who are strewn about on the floor?\" The overcrowding there was \ntremendous, it was completely unsanitary, and several of the children were\nalready sick. It's true the troops tried to make it livable for us. They \ncooked for us on their field stoves and provided us with wonderful food, but \nthe thing is that their main job was to ferret out the gang that was still at \nit everywhere, that was continuing its sordid affairs everywhere. Plus they \nwere never given any direct orders, they didn't know what they were authorized\nto do and not to do. And it was only on March 8 at five o'clock in the evening\nthat Krayev himself, the Lieutenant General, the City Commandant of Sumgait, \nwas given full authority and told everyone over a microphone from an armored \npersonnel carrier that now he could do what he wanted to do, as his heart \nadvised him, and relocate people to the military unit.\n\nBut that's not what I want to talk about now. Muslimzade, characteristically, \ntried to get me out of the SK building and take me to the City Party\nCommittee, which is across the square from the club. He took me by the\nhand and said, \"Citizen, don't worry, we'll go and have a talk in my office.\nI told him, \"No, after everything you've done, I don't believe one iota of \nwhat you say. If I go to the City Party Committee I'll disappear, and the \ntraces of me will disappear too. Because you can't stand it when . . . \" Oh \nyes, and there was another interesting detail from that meeting. It was even \nvery funny, although at the time I wasn't up to laughing. He was in a nice, \nexpensive hat, and so as to put him to shame, so to speak, I said, \"Oh, why \ndid you come here all duded up like a London dandy, you smell of good perfume,\nyou're in your starched shirt, and you have your expensive hat on. You came\nto ridicule the poor women and children who are lying on the floor, who are\nalready getting sick, whose relatives have died. Did you come to laugh at\nthem?\" And the one who was accompanying him, an Azerbaijani, I don't know who \nhe was or what his title was, he quickly snatched the hat off Muslimzade's head \nand hid it. Then I said, \"My God! We're not marauders. We're not you! We \ndidn't come to you with the intention of stealing!\" \"Well kill me, kill me!\" \nMuslimzade says to me, \"But I'm not guilty . . . kill me, kill me, but I'm not\nguilty.\" And I say, \"OK, fine, you're not guilty, have it your way. But give \nus an answer, we're asking you: Where were you when they were torturing and \nraping those poor women, when they were killing the children, burning things, \ncarrying on outrageously, and wrecking all those apartments? Where were you \nthen?\" \"You know, we didn't expect it, we did not know what to do, we didn't \nanticipate that something like that would happen in Sumgait.\" I started \nlaughing and said, \"It's truly funny.\" He says, \"What could I do? We didn't \nknow what to do.\" And I say, \"I'm sorry, but it'll be ridiculous if I tell \nyou: The First Secretary of the City Party Committee shouldn't march out in \nfront with a banner; he should fall down so that the gang would have to cross \nover his dead body. That's what you should have done. That's the way it was \nduring the war. Not a single party committee secretary compromised himself;\neither he died or he led people into battle. And what did you do? You ran \naway, you left, you hid, you marched with a flag, because you were afraid, \nexcuse my language, you feared for your own damned hide. And when we ask you, \nyou tell us that you got confused and you ask me what you could have done? \nThat's right,\" I told him, \"the City party committee got confused, all the \nparty committees got confused, the police got confused,. Baku got confused, \nthey all lay in a faint for two weeks, and the gang ran the show with \nimpunity. And if it weren't for the troops it wouldn't have been just two \ndays, there wouldn't be a single Armenian left in Sumgait for sure, they would \nhave finished their bloody affair, because they brazenly went up to some \nRussians, too, the ones who tried to say something to them, and they told \nthem, 'As soon as we finish with the Armenians we'll come after you, too.\"\n\nAnd by the way, there was a colonel, who took us to the military unit. He was\nthe one with the light blue collar tabs who flew in and two hours later\narrived on an armored personnel carrier when we were at the  SK and took us to\nthe military unit and who later started moving us from the military unit. We \nasked him, \"What? How? What will come of us?\" He openly said, \"You know, for \nus the main thing now is to catch that gang. We'll finish that quickly. You'll\nstay at the military unit for the time being, and we'll decide later.\" The \nGeneral Procuracy of the USSR arrived, it consists of investigators from all \ncities. There were some from Stavropol, from everywhere, just everywhere, because \nthe affair was truly frightful. About this, by the way, Comrade Katusev spoke;\nas everyone knows, he's the First Deputy General Procurator of the USSR. When \nhe gave us a speech from the armored personnel carrier at the military unit, \nby the way, he told us the honest truth, because he couldn't not say it, \nbecause he was still experiencing his first impressions of what he had seen, \nand he said, \"There was Afghanistan; and it was bad, but Sumgait--it's\nhorrible! And the people who dared to do such a thing will be severely \npunished, in accordance with our laws.\" And that's a quote. Then one mother \nthrows herself at him--her two sons had died before her very eyes--and says,\n\"Who will return my sons? Who is going to punish the [culprits]?\" They tried \nto calm her down, and he said, \"In order for us to conduct a proper \ninvestigation, in order that not a single scoundrel avoid responsibility, you \nmust help us, because we don't know, maybe there was someone else in the gang \nwho is now being concealed in homes, and maybe the neighbors know, maybe \nsomeone saw something. Don't be afraid, write about it in detail. So that \nyou're not afraid . . . Everyone knows that many of you are afraid, having \nlived through such horrors, they think that if they write the whole truth \nabout, let's say, their neighbor or someone else, that they will seek revenge \nlater. We're going to do it like this: We're going to set up an urn and you \ncan throw what you write in there. We don't need to know who wrote it. The \nnames of the people who write won't be made public, but we need all the\ninformation. Let each and every one not be afraid, let each write what is \nnecessary, who they saw in that gang, who made threats or shouted threatening \ngibes about the Armenians . . . You must describe all of these people and put \nthe information into the urn.\"\n\nTwo soldiers and a major guarded the urn. And, sure enough, many people, \npeople who didn't even want to write . . .I know one woman who asked me, she \ncame up and said, \"You, as a Russian, the same thing won't happen to you as \nwill happen to me. So please . . . I'll give you the information, and you \nplease write it down for me.\" So she was afraid, and there were a lot like\nher . . . But later, after Katusev made his speech, she sat and wrote down\neverything she knew. And we threw it all into the urn. Now we don't know if \nit will be of any use. For a factual picture will emerge from all that \ninformation. One person can lie, but thousands can't lie, thousands simply \ncan't lie. You have to agree with that, a fact is a fact. Why, for example, \nshould someone say that black is white if it is really black?\n\n   The First Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Azerbaijani\nSSR, Mamedov, as I said, was in Yerevan. My husband and I were at the Council \nof Ministers of the Armenian SSR and found out that Mamedov was present, the \none who had come to convince the people of Sumgait to  return to their \nprevious dwellings, to their old apartments. We asked for a meeting with him, \nand it was granted. When we went to see him he tried to behave properly, very \npolitely, delicately, but . . . when the truth was told right to his face and \nwhen I asked him some of the same questions I had asked Muslimzade, \"Where were\nyou personally when they were beating us? Now you're trying to convince us to \nreturn, why didn't you think at the time that they were slaughtering us where \nit was all leading?\" he says, \"You're telling the truth. Let's not mince \nwords. You've told me right to my face, and I'll tell you straight. I'll tell \nyou the pure truth. I was gotten out of bed in the evening, the whole \ngovernment was up, including me, and we were restraining a crowd of about \n45,000 in Baku. But we never expected that in a city like Sumgait, with its \nfine international record, such a thing could happen. We expected it in Baku.\"\nI say, \"So that means you expected it all the same? Why were you expecting \nit?\" And he says, \"You know, it just happened that way. We were expecting it \nin Baku, we were trying to restrain it, but in Sumgait . . . \" I say, \"Fine, \nyou didn't know for the first three or four hours, but then you should have \nknown. Why did no one help us?\" And he says, \"Well, OK, we didn't know what to\ndo\" and things like that. Basically it was the same story I got from \nMuslimzade. Later, when he said, \"You go on back, the situation in Sumgait is \nfavorable now, everything is fine, the Armenians are friendly with the \nAzerbaijanis . . . \" To this l answered, \"You know what . . . I'm speaking \nwith you as a [member of a] neutral nation . . . I have never argued with \nArmenians or with Azerbaijanis and I was an eyewitness . . . You tell me, \nplease, Comrade Mamedov, \" I asked him, \"What would you say about this\nhonestly, if you were being completely frank with us?\" Then he said, \"Yes, I \nadmit that I am honestly ashamed, shame on the entire Azerbaijani nation, we \nhave disgraced ourselves not only before the entire Soviet Union, but before \nthe whole world. Because now the Voice of America and all the other foreign \nradio stations of various hues are branding us with all kinds of rumors, too.\"\nAnd I say, \"There's nothing to add to what really happened. I don't think it's\npossible to add anything more awful.\" He says, \"Yes, I agree with you, I \nunderstand your pain, it is truly an unfortunate occurrence.\" I repeat that he\nsaid \"unfortunate occurrence.\" And then he suddenly remembered himself, what \nhe was saying--he had a pen in his hands, he was fidgeting with it nervously--\nand said, \"Oh, excuse me, a tragedy, really . . . \" I take this to mean that \nhe really thinks it's an \"unfortunate occurrence.\" \"And of course,\" he says, \n\"I understand that having gone through all this you can't return to Sumgait, \nbut it's necessary to cool down and realize that all those people are being \ntried.\" And he even gave a detail, which, I don't know if it matters or not, \nthat 160 policemen were being tried. Specifically in relation to that bloody \naffair.\n\nYes, by the way, there is another good detail, how I was set up at work in\nBaku after the events. I went to an undergarment plant, there was an \nAzerbaijani working there, and suddenly she tells me, \"What, they didn't\nnail your husband? They screwed up.\" I was floored, I hadn't imagined that\nanyone in Baku, too, could say something like that. Well after that I went up\nto see . . . to my office, I needed to find out about those days, what was\ngoing to happen with them, how they were going to put down those days from \nFebruary 29 to March 10 . . . and the administrator told me, \"I don't know, \nTatyana, go to the head of the conductors' pool. Be grateful if they don't \nput it down as unexcused absence.\" I was really discouraged by this. They all \nknow that we were but a hair away from death and barely survived, and here \nthey're telling me that I was skipping work, as though I was off enjoying \nmyself somewhere. I went to the office of the chief of the pool, his last name\nis Rasulov, and he's had that position for many years. Incidentally, he's a \nParty member, and is a big man in town. And suddenly, when I went to him and \nsaid, \"Comrade Rasulov, this is the way it was . . . \" He looked at me askance\nand said, \"And why are you\"--he knows me by my previous last name--\"why did\nyou get wrapped up in this mess?\" I say, \"What do you mean, why did I get \nwrapped up in this mess? My husband's an Armenian,\" I tell him, \"I have an \nArmenian last name.\" And he screwed up his face, made a kind of a grimace, as \nthough he had eaten something sour, and said, \"I didn't expect that you would\n. . . \" What did he mean by that? And \"how\" should he behave, the chief of the\npool, a man who supervises 1,700 workers? Now, it's true, there was a \nreduction, but for sure there are still 1,200 conductors working for him. And \nif someone who supervises a staff that size says things like that, then what \ncan you expect from a simple, uneducated, politically unsophisticated person?!\nHe's going to believe any and all rumors, that the Armenians are like this, \nthe Armenians are like that, and so on . . .\n\nBy the way, that Mamedov--now I'm going back to Mamedov's office when I asked \nhim \"Are you really going to guarantee the safety of our lives if we return \nto Sumgait?\" he answered, \"Yes, you know, I would guarantee them . . . I don't\nwant to take on too much, I would guarantee them firmly for 50 years. But I \nwon't guarantee them for longer than 50 years.\" I say, \"So you've got another\nthing like that planned for 50 years from  now? So they'll be quiet and then \nin another 50 years it'll happen again?!\" I couldn't contain myself any more,\nand I also told him, \"And how did it get to that point, certainly you knew\nabout it, how they were treating the Russians, for example, in Baku and in \nSumgait, how they were hounded from their jobs? Certainly you received\ncomplaints, I wrote some myself. Why did no one respond to them? Why did \neveryone ignore what was going on? Didn't you prepare people for this by the \nway you treated them?\" And he says, \"You know, you're finally starting to \ninsult me!\" He threw his pen on the desk. \"Maybe now you'll say I'm a \nscoundrel too?\" I say, \"You know, I'm not talking about you because I don't \nknow. But about the ones who I do know I can say with conviction, yes, that \ncomrade was involved in this, that, and that, because I know for certain.\n\"Well anyway he assured us that here, in Yerevan, there were false rumors, \nthat 3,000 Sumgait Armenians were here, and 15,000 were in Sumgait and had \ngotten back to work. Everyone was working, he said, and life was very good. \n\"We drove about the town ourselves, Comrade Arutiunian [First Secretary of \nthe Communist Party of Armenia SSR] came from the Council of Ministers of \nArmenian, he came and brought information showing that everything was fine in\nSumgait.\" When I asked Mamedov how he had reached that conclusion he said, '\n\"Well, I walked down the street.\" And I said, \"Walking down the street in any \ncity, even if I were to go to New York, I would never understand the situation\nbecause I would be a guest, I don't have any contact with people, but if you \nspend 10 days among some blue-collar workers in such a way that they didn't \nknow you were the First Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers, you'd \nhear something quite different.\" I told him, for example, that I drew my \nconclusion when we left the military unit to look at our apartments. They took\nus all in turns to pick things up, since people had fled to the military unit;\nthey got on the bus just to save themselves as soon as possible. How are the \nneighbors in the microdistrict, how will they view us, what do they think? I \nthought maybe that in fact it wasn't something general, of a mass nature, some\nanti-national something. And when that bus took us to our building, because it\nwas the same bus, while we were going up to our apartment, an armed soldier \naccompanied us. What does that say? It speaks of the fact that if everything \nthere were fine, why do we need to have soldiers go there and come back with\nus, going from apartment to apartment?

Patty Murrays.  We were there to discuss SSTO, and\ncommercial space.  This is how it went...\n\n\n\nAfter receiving a packet containing a presentation on the benifits of SSTO,\nI called and tried to schedule a meeting with our local Senator (D) Patty\nMurray, Washington State.  I started asking for an hour, and when I heard\nthe gasp on the end of the phone, I quickly backed off to 1/2 an hour.\nLater in that conversation, I learned that a standard appointment is 15 minutes.\n\nWe got the standard bozo treatment.  That is, we were called back by an aide,\nwho scheduled a meeting with us, in order to determine that we were not\nbozos, and to familiarize himself with the material, and to screen it, to \nmake sure that it was appropriate to take the senators time with that material.\n\nWell, I got allocated 1/2 hour with Sen. Murrays aide, and we ended up talking\nto him for 45 minutes, with us ending the meeting, and him still listening.\nWe covered a lot of ground, and only a little tiny bit was DCX specific.  \nMost of it was a single stage reusable vehicle primer.  There was another\nwoman there who took copius quantities of notes on EVERY topic that\nwe brought up.\n\nBut, with Murray being new, we wanted to entrench ourselves as non-corporate\naligned (I.E. not speaking for boeing) local citizens interentested in space.\nSo, we spent a lot of time covering the benifits of lower cost access to\nLEO.  Solar power satellites are a big focus here, so we hit them as becoming \nfeasible with lower cost access, and we hit the environmental stand on that.\nWe hit the tourism angle, and I left a copy of the patric Collins Tourism\npaper, with side notes being that everyone who goes into space, and sees the\natmosphere becomes more of an environmentalist, esp. after SEEING the smog\nover L.A.  We hit on the benifits of studying bone decalcification (which is \nmore pronounced in space, and said that that had POTENTIAL to lead to \nunderstanding of, and MAYBE a cure for osteoporosis.  We hit the education \nwhereby kids get enthused by space, but as they get older and find out that\nthey havent a hop in hell of actually getting there, they go on to other\nfields, with low cost to orbit, the chances they might get there someday \nwould provide greater incentive to hit the harder classes needed.\n\nWe hit a little of the get nasa out of the operational launch vehicle business\nangle.  We hit the lower cost of satellite launches, gps navigation, personal\ncommunicators, tellecommunications, new services, etc...  Jobs provided\nin those sectors.\n\nJobs provided building the thing, balance of trade improvement, etc..\nWe mentioned that skypix would benifit from lower launch costs.\n\nWe left the paper on what technologies needed to be invested in in order\nto make this even easier to do.  And he asked questions on this point.\n\nWe ended by telling her that we wanted her to be aware that efforts are\nproceeding in this area, and that we want to make sure that the\nresults from these efforts are not lost (much like condor, or majellan),\nand most importantly, we asked that she help fund further efforts along\nthe lines of lowering the cost to LEO.\n\nIn the middle we also gave a little speal about the Lunar Resource Data \nPurchase act, and the guy filed it separately, he was VERY interested in it.\nHe asked some questions about it, and seemed like he wanted to jump on it,\nand contact some of the people involved with it, so something may actually\nhappen immediatly there.\n\nThe last two things we did were to make sure that they knew that we\nknew a lot of people in the space arena here in town, and that they\ncould feel free to call us any time with questions, and if we didn't know\nthe answers, that we would see to it that they questions got to people who\nreally did know the answers.\n\nThen finally, we asked for an appointment with the senator herself.  He\nsaid that we would get on the list, and he also said that knowing her, this\nwould be something that she would be very interested in, although they\ndo have a time problem getting her scheduled, since she is only in the\nstate 1 week out of 6 these days.\n\nAll in all we felt like we did a pretty good job."},{"role":"assistant","content":"sci.space"}]}

THE PERSONS OF THE GODHEAD\n     Of all of the doctrines of Scripture, this is the most\n     important.  The Bible is pre-eminently a revelation of God. \n     Therefore, our first objective in studying the Bible should\n     be to know God.\n     I believe that the Bible teaches that there are Three\n     Persons in the Godhead (Trinity):  God, the Father; God the\n     Son--the Lord Jesus Christ; and God, the Holy Spirit.  I\n     believe that they are individual Persons who are one in\n     nature, meaning that They are identical in nature, each\n     possessing the same divine attributes.  They are also\n     equally worthy of our worship, our trust, and our obedience.\n     Cf. Matt.28:19, 2 Cor.13:14; John 14:8,9,16,17.\n\nII.  THE ATTRIBUTES, or CHARACTERISTICS, OF THE GODHEAD.\n     A.  God's nature is revealed in the Name He has taken for\n         Himself: Jehovah.  He is the living God, eternal, and\n         unchanging.  He is without beginning, and without\n         ending.  Cf. Isa.42:8.\n     B.  God is a spirit.  Cf. John 4:24.\n     C.  God is love.  Cf. 1 John 4:8,16.\n         As such, He is gracious, merciful, good, faithful,\n         patient, and full of lovingkindness.  Cf. Psa 89:1,2;\n         Psa 103:8; Nahum 1:7.\n     D.  But God is also holy and righteous.  He is absolutely\n         without sin in His nature, and so is incapable of\n         sinning in though, word, or action.  Cf. Ex. 15:11; Isa.\n         6:3.\n     E.  God is omnipresent (everywhere present at the same time\n         in the completeness of His Person), omniscient (all\n         knowing, knowing all things--the end from the beginning,\n         infinitely wise), omnipotent (almighty, sovereign, with\n         unlimited power over all creation).\n         God is infinite in His presence, wisdom, and power.  It\n         is my conviction that the work of the Lord in our day\n         has become very man-centered, and that the people in our\n         churches know very little about God.  I believe that the\n         Lord's work needs to be God-centered, and that the\n         people of God need to understand that God is sovereign\n         in all things:  in the affairs of nations, in the lives\n         of all people, and in the carrying out of His purposes\n         regarding salvation.\n\nIII.     THE WORKS OF THE GODHEAD.\n     A.  In creation\n          All Three Persons of the Godhead were active in\n          creating, and all Three are active in sustaining\n          creation, and in ordering the course of human affairs\n          (for nations as well as individual people) to the end\n          of time.  Cf. Gen. 1:1,2; John 1:1-3; Col. 1:16-17;\n          Heb. 1:3.\n     B.  In salvation\n         In order to understand salvation I believe that it is\n         absolutely necessary to begin with God, not with man. \n         All three Persons of the Godhead have been, and are,\n         active in salvation.\n         1.  God, the Father\n             Salvation originated with God.  The Members of the\n             Godhead determined in eternity past that there would\n             be salvation, the conditions under which people\n             could and would be saved, and even who would be\n             saved.  Election to salvation is recognized in\n             Scripture as the work of  God, the Father.  Cf. Eph\n             1:3-4; 2 Thess 2:13-14.\n         2.  Christ, the Son of God\n             The Lord Jesus Christ, through His birth by the\n             virgin Mary, came to the earth to accomplish two\n             important works:\n             a.   He came as the final and complete revelation of\n                  God, the Father.  Cf. Col 1:15; heb 1:1-3.\n             b.   He came to provide salvation for all whom the\n                  Father had chosen.  He did this by His death on\n                  the Cross, by His bodily resurrection, and by\n                  His present intercessory work in heaven.  The\n                  work of salvation will be completed for us when\n                  the Lord returns.  Cf. Rom 5:8-10; 1 Cor 15:3-\n                  4; Heb 7:25, 1 John 3:2.\n         3.  The Holy Spirit\n             As the Author of Scripture, the theme of which is\n             Christ and His redemptive work, the Holy Spirit is\n             carrying out the redemptive plan of God in the\n             following ways:\n             a.   He convicts of sin. Cf. John 16:7-11\n             b.   He regenerates (known in the Bible as the new\n                  birth).  Cf. John 3:5-8.\n             c.   He indwells each believer to fulfill the work\n                  of sanctification.  Cf. John 14-16-17.\n             d.   He seals every believer in Christ, thus making \n                  salvation secure.  Cf. Eph 1:13-14.\n             e.   He baptizes every believer into the body of\n                  Christ.  Cf. Cor. 12:13\n             f.   He teaches every believer the truth of\n                  Scripture. Cf. John 14:26.\n             g.   He bestows spiritual gifts on the people of \n                  God for ministry.  (Cf. 1 Cor 12\n             h.   He restrains sin.  Cf Gal 5:16-26.\n             i.   He empowers for living and for service.  \n                  Cf. Acts 1:8\n\n"},{"role":"assistant","content":"soc.religion.christian"}]}

During  the attacks launched\nagainst the Turks by the Greeks, on 20th December 1963, Dr. Nihat\nIlhan's  wife and  three  children were  ruthlessly and  brutally\nkilled in the  bathroom, where they had tried to  hide, by savage\nGreeks. Dr.  Nihat Ilhan happened to  be on duty that  night, the\n24th   December  1963.   Pictures  reflecting   Greek  atrocities\ncommitted during and after 1963 are exhibited in this house which\nhas been converted into a museum.\n\nAN EYE-WITNESS ACCOUNT  OF HOW A TURKISH FAMILY  WAS BUTCHERED BY\nGREEK TERRORISTS\n\nThe date  is the 24th of  December, 1963... The onslaught  of the\nGreeks against the Turks, which  started three days ago, has been\ngoing on  with all its  ferocity; and defenseless women,  old men\nand children are being brutally  killed by Greeks. And now Kumsal\nArea of Nicosia witnesses the  worst example of the Greeks savage\nbloodshed...\n\nThe wife  and the  three infant  children of  Dr. Nihat  Ilhan, a\nmajor on duty at the camp  of the Cyprus Turkish Army Contingent,\nare  mercilessly and  dastardly  shot dead  while  hiding in  the\nbathroom of their house, by  maddened Greeks who broke into their\nhome. A glaring example of Greek barbarism.\n\nLet us  now listen to the  relating of the said  incident told by\nMr. Hasan  Yusuf Gudum, an  eye witness, who himself  was wounded\nduring the same terrible event.\n\n\"On the night of the 24th  of December, 1963 my wife Feride Hasan\nand I were paying a visit to the family of Major Dr. Nihat Ilhan.\nOur neighbours  Mrs. Ayshe of  Mora, her daughter Ishin  and Mrs.\nAyshe's  sister Novber  were also  with us.  We were  all sitting\nhaving supper.  All of  a sudden bullets  from the  Pedieos River\ndirection started to riddle the  house, sounding like heavy rain.\nThinking  that   the  dining-room  where  we   were  sitting  was\ndangerous, we  ran to  the bathroom and  toilet which  we thought\nwould be  safer. Altogether we were  nine persons. We all  hid in\nthe bathroom  except my wife  who took  refuge in the  toilet. We\nwaited in fear. Mrs. Ilhan the wife of Major Doctor, was standing\nin the bath with her three children Murat, Kutsi and Hakan in her\narms. Suddenly with  a great noise we heard the  front door open.\nGreeks had  come in and were  combing, every corner of  the house\nwith  their machine  gun bullets.  During these  moments I  heard\nvoices saying, in  Greek, \"You want Taksim eh!\"  and then bullets\nstarted flying in the bathroom. Mrs. Ilhan and her three children\nfell into  the bath. They were  shot. At this moment  the Greeks,\nwho broke  into the bathroom, emptied  their guns on us  again. I\nheard one of the Major's children moan, then I fainted.\n\nWhen I came  to myself 2 or  3 hours later, I saw  Mrs. Ilhan and\nher three children lying dead in the  bath. I and the rest of the\nneighbours in the  bathroom were all seriously  wounded. But what\nhad happened to my wife? Then I remembered and immediately ran to\nthe  toilet, where,  in  the doorway,  I saw  her  body. She  was\nbrutally murdered.\n\nIn the  street admist the  sound of  shots I heard  voices crying\n\"Help, help. Is  there no one to save us?\"  I became terrified. I\nthought that  if the Greeks came  again and found that  I was not\ndead they would kill  me. So I ran to the  bedroom and hid myself\nunder the double-bed.\n\nAn our  passed by. In the  distance I could still  hear shots. My\nmouth was dry,  so I came out  from under the bed  and drank some\nwater. Then I put  some sweets in my pocket and  went back to the\nbathroom, which was exactly as I had left in an hour ago. There I\noffered sweets  to Mrs. Ayshe,  her daughter and Mrs.  Novber who\nwere all wounded.\n\nWe  waited in  the bathroom  until 5  o'clock in  the morning.  I\nthought morning would never come.  We were all wounded and needed\nto be taken  to hospital. Finally, as we could  walk, Mrs. Novber\nand I, went  out into the street hoping to  find help, and walked\nas far as Koshklu Chiftlik.\n\nThere, we met  some people who took us to  hospital where we were\noperated on. When  I regained my consciousness I  said that there\nwere more  wounded in the  house and  they went and  brought Mrs.\nAyshe and her daughter.\n\nAfter staying three  days in the hospital I was  sent by plane to\nAnkara  for  further treatment.  There  I  have had  four  months\ntreatment but still I cannot use  my arm. On my return to Cyprus,\nGreeks arrested me at the Airport.\n\nAll  I have  related to  you above  I told  the Greeks  during my\ndetention. They then released me.\"\n\nON FOOT INTO CYPRUS'S DEVASTATED TURKISH QUARTER\n\nWe went tonight into the sealed-off Turkish quarter of Nicosia in\nwhich 200  to 300 people have  been slaughtered in the  last five\ndays.\n\nWe  were the  first  Western  reporters there,  and  we saw  some\nterrible sights.\n\nIn the Kumsal quarter at No. 2, Irfan Bey Sokagi, we made our way\ninto  a house  whose floors  were  covered with  broken glass.  A\nchild's bicycle lay in a corner.\n\nIn the  bathroom, looking  like a group  of waxworks,  were three\nchildren piled on top of their murdered mother.\n\nIn a room next to it we glimpsed  the body of a woman shot in the\nhead.\n\nThis, we  were told, was the  home of a Turkish  Army major whose\nfamily had been killed by the mob in the first violence.\n\nToday was five days later, and still they lay there.\n\nRene MacCOLL and Daniel McGEACHIE, (From the \"DAILY EXPRESS\")\n\n\"...I saw in  a bathroom the bodies of a  mother and three infant\nchildren murdered because their father was a Turkish Officer...\"\n\nMax CLOS, LE FIGARO 25-26 January, 1964\n\n\n Peter Moorhead reporting from the village of Skyloura, Cyprus. \n Date : 1 January, 1964. \n\n IL GIARNO (Italy)\n \n THEY ARE TURK-HUNTING, THEY WANT TO EXTERMINATE THEM.\n\n Discussions start in London; in Cyprus terror continues.

I doubt if a napalm bomb\nattack could have created more devastation. I counted 40 blackened brick\nand concrete shells that had once been homes. Each house had been deliberately\nfired by petrol. Under red tile roofs which had caved in, I found a twisted\nmass of bed springs, children's conts and cribs, and ankle deep grey\nashes of what had once been chairs, tables and wardrobes.\n\nIn the neighbouring village of Ayios Vassilios, a mile away, I counted 16 \nwrecked and burned out homes. They were all Turkish Cypriot homes. From\nthis village more than 100 Turkish Cypriots had also vanished.In neither village\ndid I find a scrap of damage to any Greek Cypriot house.\n\n\n DAILY TELEGRAPH (London)\n \n GRAVES OF 12 SHOT TURKISH CYPRIOTS FOUND IN CYPRUS VILLAGE\n\n Silent crowds gathered tonight outside the Red Crescent hospital in the\n Turkish Sector of Nicosia, as the bodies of 9 Turkish Cypriots found\n crudely buried outside the village of Ayios Vassilios, 13 miles away, were\n brought to the hospital under the escort of the Parachute Regiment. Three \n more bodies, including one of a woman, were discovered nearby but could\n not be removed.

His explaination was that \nwhile it is possible for a couple to marry without the presence\nof a priest, it is important to have it recognized by the \nChurch as soon as it is possible.  Because the Church \nrecoginizes itself as a community of believers, members\nof the church, to some degree, are to be held accountable\nto each other.  To be less hypothetical than that mythical\ncouple on the desert island, there are many places in the\nworld that do not have priests availible for marriages\non a regular basis.  Therefore, couples get married without\nthe priest being present, but get the priest to testify to\ntheir marriage when one comes through the area.  \n\n\tI remember a religion teacher in high school saying\nthat the marriage ceremony is not for the benefit of the couple\nas much as it is for the benefit of the community.  Thus,\nmarried couples have some responsibility to the community\nto stay married, as divorce sets a bad example for the\ncommunity.  Also, the couple has vowed to become one with\none another--the community should be able to rely on that \ncouple to be as one.\n\n\tWhile couples may marry without witnesses, they \nmay NOT get anulments without a priest present.  An \nanulment is simply an admission of the church that what\nthey had declared a marriage was not, in fact, a marriage\nat all, for whatever reason.  So don't start getting married\nin the back seat of a station wagon and giving yourselves\nanulments a half-hour later!!\n\n\tI tend to agree with the response back there that\nsaid couples become married as soon as they consumate their\nmarriage, but I would add that couples should consider their\nmarriage consumated if they have sex, whether or not they\nintended to be married, assuming they were both willing\npartners to the sexual act.  The couple must be prepared\nto raise any children they may have as a result of that\nsexual act with the benefit of both parents.  Sex IS a\ncommitment, I believe, in God's eyes.\n\n\tBut I'm digressing....\n\n\t\t\tGod be with you,"},{"role":"assistant","content":"soc.religion.christian"}]}

Obiviously, any such landlord\nwould have found himself a foreigner in Palestine and would\nbe motivated to sell, regardless of the price.\n\nIt is interesting though that you acknowledge that the\npalestinians were shafted.

Once again, to not believe in God is different than saying  \nI BELIEVE that God does not exist. I still maintain the position, even \nafter reading the FAQs, that strong atheism requires faith.\n\nBut first let me say the following.\nWe might have a language problem here - in regards to \"faith\" and\n\"existence\". I, as a Christian, maintain that God does not exist.\nTo exist means to have being in space and time. God does not HAVE\nbeing - God IS Being. Kierkegaard once said that God does not\nexist, He is eternal. With this said, I feel it's rather pointless\nto debate the so called \"existence\" of God - and that is not what\nI'm doing here. I believe that God is the source and ground of\nbeing. When you say that \"god does not exist\", I also accept this\nstatement - but we obviously mean two different things by it. However,\nin what follows I will use the phrase \"the existence of God\" in it's\n'usual sense' - and this is the sense that I think you are using it.\nI would like a clarification upon what you mean by \"the existence of\nGod\".\n \nWe also might differ upon what it means to have faith. Here is what\n\nfaith \n1a: allegiance to duty or a person: LOYALTY\nb  (1): fidelity to one's promises\n   (2): sincerity of intentions\n2a (1): belief and trust in and loyalty to God\n   (2): belief in the traditional doctrines of a religion\nb  (1): firm belief in something for which there is no proof\n        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n   (2): complete trust\n3: something that is believed esp. with strong conviction; esp: a system \n   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\nof religious beliefs\nsyn see BELIEF\n\n\n\nOne can never prove that God does or does not exist. When you say\nthat you believe God does not exist, and that this is an opinion\n\"based upon observation\", I will have to ask \"what observtions are\nyou refering to?\" There are NO observations - pro or con - that\nare valid here in establishing a POSITIVE belief. All observations\ncan only point you in a direction - a direction that we might even\nbe predisposed to (by predisposed I mean, for example, people whoes \npartents \"believe in God\" also tend to). To actually draw a conclusion\nabout the \"existence\" or \"non-existence\" of God requires a leap - and\nyou have made this leap when you actively say \"I believe that God  \ndoes/does not exist\". Personally, I think that both statements are\nmisguided. Arguing over the \"existence\" of God is precisely the wrong way\nto find Him (and yes, I use \"Him\" because a personal God is the only \nviable concept (IMO) - if a person wants to use \"She\" go ahead. Of course \nGod is neither He nor She - but we have no choice but to \nanthropomorphise. If you want me to explain myself further I'll be \nglad to.) \n\n\n\nAnd please, if someone does not agree with me - even if they violently \ndisagree - it's in no ones advantage to start name calling. If a person \nthinks I've misunderstood something in the FAQs, or if they they think \nI have not read them well enough, just point out to me the error of my \nways and I correct the situation. I'm interested in a polite and well  \nthought out discussion.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"role":"assistant","content":"alt.atheism"}]}

If it's a choice\nbetween injuring/killing a dog or getting yourself injured/killed, there is\nonly one rational decision.  Only the most insane animal rights kook would put\nthe dog first.\n\nSecond, it's useful to learn how to read a dog's body language.  How you react\nto a dog who is chasing you because he thinks it's a game (and that you're\nplaying with him) is completely different from how you react to a dog which\nhas hostile intent.\n\nThird, it's useful to learn how to present yourself to a dog.  Dogs are social\nbeasts, and recognize a domination/submission hierarchy.  To a dog, there are\ntwo types of fellow-creatures; that which he dominates, and that which\ndominate him.  You need to unambiguously represent yourself as being of the\nlatter class.  You are God: you are easily angered and your anger is terrible.\nBut God is also amused by one who properly submits to His dominance, and may\neven on rare occasions dispense a kind word, a kind word, or even (oh joy oh\nrapture unforeseen) A Dog Bisquit!\n\nNow, how does that all relate to biking?  Well, first, it's a good idea to\nassume that most dogs who chase motorcycles do so because they think it's a\ngame, and not out of overt hostility.  The MSF suggestion is a very good one;\nwhen you see the dog coming, slow down so he determines a particular place of\ninterception.  Just before you (and he) reach that spot, punch the throttle so\nthat when he reaches it you're already long gone.  Dogs take a few seconds to\nreact to new input, and definitely cannot comprehend the acceleration that a\nmotorcycle is capable of.\n\nWith a hostile dog, or one which you repeatedly encounter, stronger measures\nmay be necessary.  This is the face off.  First -- and there is very important\n-- make sure you NEVER face off a dog on his territory.  Face him off on the\nroad, not on his driveway.  If necessary, have a large stick, rolled up\nnewspaper, etc. (something the beast will understand is something that will\nhurt him).  Stand your ground, then slowly advance.  Your mental attitude is\nthat you are VERY ANGRY and are going to dispense TERRIBLE PUNISHMENT.  The\nlarger the dog, the greater your anger.\n\nDogs will pick up anger, just as they can pick up fear.  And, since you and he\nare not on his home territory, it may suddenly dawn on the dog that perhaps he\nis on your territory, and that you are prepared to fight to the death.\n\nMost dogs will decide that it is a good idea to retreat to their own territory\nwhere there is at least a home advantage.  They'll also observe that you are\nsatisfied by that retreat (gesture of submission) and thus they have escaped\npunishment."},{"role":"assistant","content":"rec.motorcycles"}]}

Please accept this as a serious attempt to\nfoster dialog and rest assurred that I make every attempt to make fun of no\none, except myself ;-)]\n\n\n\n[...]\n\n\n\tHmmm.  There are other animals on this planet with advanced\n\tmental facilities which have not developed \"religion\" as a\n\tsatisfactory explaination for the unexplained.  Why is this so?\n\n\tFurther, it appears that only humans have a \"need\" to explain the\n\tunexplained.  Why is this so?  The other animals on this planet,\n\tincluding those with advanced mental facilities, seem perfectly\n\tcontent in their ignorance.\n\n\tI'd like to point out that your presuppositions scream out at me\n\tfrom your unsupported statement.  They are: 1) humans are animal\n\t*only*; 2) religion exists as a crutch so that the unexplained need\n\tnot be researched; 3) religion was \"made up\" by humans to address a\n\tperceived need; 4) the biological aspect of humans is deified (that\n\tis, all aspects of human life can be categorized in a hierarchical\n\tstructure with biology at the apex).\n\n\tNeedless to say, I disagree with your strong opinion #1 and the\n\tunderlying presuppositions.\n\n\n\tI disagree that Christianity is \"an infectious cult\".  It has\n\tcertainly shown itself to be persistent as a belief system, in\n\tspite of various persecutions throughout the past two millenia.\n\tThat it continues to persevere does not demonstrate that it is\n\t\"infectious\" in a derrogatory sense; it may be that it provides\n\ta workable system for its adherents (and I would argue that this\n\tis the case).\n\n\tI disagree that Christianity is \"a safety blanket\" which supplants\n\thope and purpose.  Rather, it points an individual to the one\n\tSource of hope and purpose.  There is nothing hidden about a\n\tChristian's source for hope and purpose.  Of what usefulness to\n\tyou is the distinction between internally motivated hope and purpose\n\tand externally given hope and purpose?  Is the (apparent) loss of\n\tcontrol over one's own life the problem or is it something else?\n\n\tFinally, one does not appropriate \"eternal happiness\" by following\n\tChristian moral standards.  Indeed, the sole reason for the existance\n\tof Christianity is *because* standards are inadequate to save people\n\tfrom their imperfections.  Moral standards are merely guides to the\n\tChristian; the real power to moral living is given to the Christian\n\tin the Person of God's Spirit.\n\n\tHeaven is one of two final states that\n\tChristian doctrine postulates.  However, Christians are generally\n\tnot motivated to live according to Christian moral standards by this\n\tpromised future reward; rather, they are motivated by the perceived\n\tbenefits to them in the here-and-now.\n\n\n\tMany Christian organizations are concerned with evangelism as a\n\tpriority, and rightly so (for it was Jesus Himself who gave this\n\tas a priority for His followers).  However, it is not the penultimate\n\tpriority as evangelism is normally understood (i.e. preach the word,\n\tconvert at nearly any cost, repeat with new convert ad infinitum).\n\tRather, such evangelism is generally best done through respecting\n\tthe opinions of others while *demonstrating* the very real benefits\n\tof a Christian lifestyle.  This demonstration should be so powerful\n\tthat it compels the non-Christian to seek out the Christian to ask\n\t\"Why?\"  Needless to say, such a demonstration is not easily accom-\n\tplished (it takes a radical committment to the person of Jesus), it\n\tdoes not happen quickly (so perseverance on the part of the Christian\n\tis required), and it cannot occur where no personal bonds of\n\tfriendship exist (it is ineffective with strangers who cannot\n\tevaluate the demonstration over time, and it is easy to alienate or\n\tharm others if the sole purpose of being a \"friend\" is to gain a\n\tconversion).\n\n\tAs a long-time Christian (nearly 20 years), I view with some skep-\n\tticism *all* evangelism programs which incorporate a \"hurry-up\"\n\tattitude.  Pressured conversions may ultimately be worse than no\n\tconversion at all (because the pressured convert realizes s/he was\n\tcoerced and disavows Christianity when they would have been open\n\tto it in the future had they not been taken advantage of now).\n\tThe Bible states that it is the very Spirit of God which brings\n\tconviction of wrong-doing to people.  I am content to do my part\n\t(witness) and let the Spirit do the rest.\n\n\n\tWe are far more than animals.  We sleep, eat, reproduce, and die\n\tjust as other animals do - true.  But, we are also capable of more\n\tthan this.  If your personal vision of humanity (or of yourself) is\n\tso limited, I can only hope and pray ;-) that you will someday find\n\ta more expansive view.\n\n\t(For reflection, what animals have the wide variety of performing\n\tarts that humans do?  How is it that humans can learn the language\n\tof other humans (or animals) but that other animals cannot do so?\n\tHow is it that humans can organize themselves in various social\n\tstructures whereas other animals have only one structure?)\n\n\n\tBlatant assertion.  Christianity is not physically addictive.\n\tChristianity is not psychologically addictive.  Christianity is not\n\ta *thing* which one snorts/ingests/shoots-up; it is a relationship\n\twith a living being.  You might as validly characterize any close-\n\tknit relationship with this appelation.\n\n\n\tThere are \"Jesus freaks\" who let the emotional aspects of worship\n\tand Christian living gain (and retain) the upper hand.  Even so,\n\tthis does not by itself invalidate the foundation from which these\n\tthings flow.\n\n\n\tGuilty by association?  That \"christianity\" which forces itself\n\tupon another is not Christianity at all.\n\n\n\tYou appear to have an amazing certainty about what really happened\n\t2000 years ago.  How did you come by it?\n\n\tI cannot accept your conclusion that Jesus' influence was a sole\n\tresult of the Roman sack of Jerusalem in 70AD.  He was 30+ years\n\tgone by this time.  It strains the bounds of credulity to assert\n\tthat nothing about Jesus' life was noteworthy _until_ the sack.\n\n\n\tChristianity is having a relationship with Jesus Christ Himself.\n\tWhat do you know of Him?\n"},{"role":"assistant","content":"soc.religion.christian"}]}

Shaw  (History),  who  recently\ncompleted  two books:  The Jews  of  the Ottoman  Empire and  the\nTurkish Republic, and Turkey and  the Holocaust: Turkey's Role in\nRescuing  Turkish  and  European  Jewry  from  Nazi  Persecution,\n1933-45. Shaw  chairs the undergraduate  interdepartmental degree\nprogram in Near Eastern Studies and has organized the Program for\nthe Study of Ottoman and Turkish Jewry. He is affiliated with the\nG. E. von Grunebaum Center for Near Eastern Studies.\n\nEditor: How did  you come to write these two  books on Turkey and\nEuropean and Turkish Jews?\n\nShaw: Basically, I'm  an Ottoman historian, but  I'm also Jewish.\nI've  spent twenty-five  years studying  Ottoman history,  and as\ntime went along, whenever I  found materials on the Ottoman Jews,\nI collected  them. But  I never  did anything  with them  until a\ncouple of years  ago, when I suddenly realized that  1992 was the\n500th  anniversary of  the  Jews being  expelled  from Spain  and\ncoming  to Turkey.  Then the  Sephardic Temple  down on  Wilshire\nAvenue invited me  to give a series of three  lectures on Ottoman\nJewry.  These lectures  were  greatly appreciated,  and I  became\nmotivated to  undertake further research  to develop a  book, The\nJews of the  Ottoman Empire and the Turkish)  Republic. This book\nis quite different from the  works of most Jewish historians, who\ntend to look  at the Jews in any country  more from the viewpoint\nof the Jews  and the Jewish community, and rely  mainly on Jewish\nsources.  I  view my  subject  as  an  Ottoman historian,  and  I\napproach the Jews of the Ottoman Empire largely from the point of\nview of Ottoman  society, using largely Ottoman  sources. After I\nfinished  this book  and  sent it  to the  press,  I came  across\nadditional documents  relating to  Turkish Jews during  World War\nII. In the completed book, I had said that Turkey had done a good\ndeal  to rescue  the Jews  during  World War  II, but  I did  not\nactually have many details. Then I  found a batch of documents in\nthe Foreign Ministry archive relating to actions taken by Turkish\ndiplomats to  help the Jews  before and during the  Holocaust. It\nwas too late to add this new information to the book in press, so\nI decided to  write a second book. I  conducted further research,\nmainly in the archives of the  Foreign Ministry in Ankara and the\nTurkish Embassy and Consulate in Paris. The result was the second\nbook, Turkey and  the Holocaust, which details  how Turkey helped\nrescue Jews from the Nazis.\n\n- How exactly did they do this?\n\nThe story takes  place over a number of years.  The book presents\nthe material in three parts, first of which deals with the period\nbefore the Holocaust. When the Nazis  came to power in Germany in\n1933,  they immediately  started  dismissing  Jews and  anti-Nazi\nGermans from universities,  hospitals, scientific institutes, and\nthe like. Turkey at that moment was just beginning the process of\nreforming its  universities, and it  saw in these Jews,  who were\nbeing fired from their positions in Germany, a good source of new\ntalent to  help modernize the Turkish  universities. Within three\nmonths  after the  Nazis  started dismissing  these Jews,  Turkey\narranged to take many of them in. They were brought to Turkey and\nwere   given   appointments   as  professors   in   the   Turkish\nuniversities, as  heads of scientific institutes,  and as medical\npersonnel in hospitals. About 300  to 500 major Jewish professors\ncame to  Turkey in  the 1930s. Ernst  Reuter, a  German political\nscientist,  spent the  war  years teaching  political science  in\nTurkey. After  World War II,  he was  mayor of Berlin  during the\nBerlin Airlift.  Fritz Neimark, a major  German Jewish economist,\ncame to Turkey and helped  establish a modern school of economics\nin Istanbul.  A man named  Reichenbach, who was rescued  from the\nNazis by  Turkey and  spent the war  years in  Turkey, eventually\ncame to  UCLA, where he  became a professor of  philosophy. Other\nGerman Jewish  emigres engaged in cultural  activities in Turkey.\nOne  such was  Karl  Ebert,  who had  been  a leading  theatrical\nproducer in Berlin until he was expelled by the Nazis. He went to\nTurkey, where he  organized the Turkish National  Theater and the\nTurkish National Opera  Company in Ankara, with the  help of Paul\nHindemuth. So  the first  section of the  book covers  this first\nphase, when Jews were being  persecuted in Germany and rescued by\nTurkey.  Oddly enough,  the  German emigres,  when  they were  in\nTurkey, did not seem to think too badly of Germany. They regarded\nthemselves more  as Germans than Jews,  and they did not  join in\nthe anti-Nazi activities of the local Turkish Jewish community. I\neven  found  letters  from  the Nazi  representatives  to  Turkey\npraising these German Jewish refugees for their work in promoting\nthe idea  of German  culture. Even though  these people  had been\npersecuted by the Nazis and rescued by the Turks, they shared the\nNazis' feelings of  Aryan racial superiority over  the Turks. The\nsecond part of the book deals  with the Holocaust, which began in\n1940 when the Nazis occupied France.  In Europe at that time, and\nespecially in France, there were  about 20,000 Turkish Jews. They\nhad migrated to Europe for various reasons from about the turn of\nthe century onward. Most of them had settled in Europe during the\nTurkish war for  independence after World War I,  when Greece was\nthreatening to overrun Turkey. The Greeks had persecuted the Jews\nthroughout the nineteenth century, and the Jews feared what might\nhappen to them if the Greeks  took over in Turkey. Many Jews fled\nto France during  the 1920s and 1930s. Many  also abandoned their\nTurkish  citizenship and  became  French  citizens. Suddenly  the\nNazis invaded France in 1940 and started introducing all sorts of\nanti-Jewish laws.  The Turkish  Jews soon found  that it  was not\nworth very much to  be a French Jew, but that it  was worth a lot\nto be a Turkish Jew.\n\n- How so?\n\nTurkey remained neutral through most of World War II. It retained\nits embassies  and consulates in all  the Nazi-occupied countries\nuntil it finally entered the war on the side of the Allies at the\nend of 1944. During the war,  therefore, Turkey was in a position\nto  defend its  citizens  against anti-Jewish  measures, and  the\nactions that  Turkish diplomats took  form the second  chapter of\nthe  book. Turkish  diplomats  who were  stationed  in France  in\nparticular intervened to protect Jews of Turkish citizenship from\nthe Nazis. For those Turkish  Jews who had retained their Turkish\ncitizenship,  there  was  generally  no  problem.  If  they  were\narrested and sent to a  concentration camp, the Turkish diplomats\nwould  communicate with  the  commanders of  the  camp and  other\nofficials and say in effect:  \"These people are Turkish citizens.\nYou  can't do  this  to  them.\" And  the  Turkish  Jews would  be\nreleased.  If  their  businesses were  confiscated,  the  Turkish\ndiplomats would protest and the businesses would be restored.\n\nThe Nazis  in general  wanted to keep  the friendship  of Turkey.\nThey hoped to be able to use  Turkey as a gateway for an invasion\nof the Middle  East, and they also wanted to  obtain chromium and\nmanganese from Turkey. In order  to keep Turkish friendship, they\nusually accepted  these interventions on behalf  of Turkish Jews.\nThe Turkish  diplomats sometimes went to  the concentration camps\nto secure the release of Turkish Jews. At times they even boarded\ntrains hauling  Turkish Jews  to Auschwitz for  extermination and\nsucceeded in getting them off the train. Most of the foreign Jews\nwere sent  to a concentration  camp at  a place called  Drancy in\nParis,  and that's  where  most of  the  intercession by  Turkish\nconsuls took place.\n\nThe greater problem came with  the Turkish Jews who had abandoned\ntheir  Turkish citizenship  and had  become French  citizens. The\nconsuls couldn't declare that  these people were Turkish citizens\nbecause  they were  not.  My book  includes  photographs of  Jews\nlining  up in  front  of  the Turkish  consulate,  either to  get\npassports to  return to Turkey or  to get a restoration  of their\nTurkish  citizenship.   This  was   a  bureaucratic   matter,  so\nprocessing the application would take  some time. In the meantime\nit was a  real emergency, because the Nazis would  arrest Jews on\nthe streets for almost nothing.  The Nazis would even arrest them\nif they  had radios  or telephones  in their  apartments, because\nradios and  telephones were  forbidden to Jews.  To take  care of\nthese  former  Turkish Jews,  the  Turkish  diplomats invented  a\ndocument called  gayri muntazem  vatandash, or  \"irregular fellow\ncitizen.\" The  document said in  effect \"This person is  a former\nTurkish  citizen  who has  applied  for  the restoration  of  his\nTurkish citizenship.  In the meantime  we would appreciate  it if\nyou  would treat  him  as  if he  were  a  Turkish citizen.\"  The\ndiplomats wrote  the document in  Turkish and put their  seals on\nit. Since  the Nazis could  not read  Turkish, on the  whole they\naccepted  these papers  as certificates  of citizenship.  By this\nmeans, the  Turkish diplomats were  able to rescue many  Jews who\nhad relinquished their Turkish citizenship.\n\nActually the Nazis were of two minds about the Turkish defense of\nJews. On the one hand the  Nazi Foreign Ministry, which wanted to\nretain the friendship of Turkey,  was in favor of accepting these\ninterventions. On the other hand, Himmler and Eichmann wanted all\nJews exterminated.  At times  Himmler and  Eichmann were  able to\nprevail and some  of the Turkish Jews were sent  off to Auschwitz\nbefore the Turkish consuls could do anything.\n\n- Do you have statistics on how many Turkish Jews were rescued?\n\nThere were about  20,000 Turkish Jews in Europe  before world War\nII,  about 10,000  of whom  were living  in France.  Most of  the\ninformation in this section of  the book relates to the situation\nin France. I have published  the letters that the Turkish consuls\nsent to  the Nazi  officials and  the letters  that came  back in\nreply. Generally the Nazis said  that if the Turkish consul would\npresent  documents  certifying   that  arrested  individuals  are\nTurkish citizens,  and promise  to send them  out of  France, the\nNazis would release them from the concentration camp. The Turkish\nconsuls also organized  special trains to take  Turkish Jews from\nNazi-occupied  territory   back  to  Turkey.  These   trains  ran\nregularly in 1943 and 1944. The Nazis gave the Turkish Jews visas\nso they  could pass out  of Nazi  territory, but the  trains were\noften  held  up by  the  Nazi-influenced  governments of  Eastern\nEurope  -   Croatia,  Serbia,   and  Bulgaria  -   because  these\ngovernments really didn't want the Jews to escape. As a result of\nthe Turkish consuls' efforts, about 3,000 to 4,000 of the Turkish\nJews  in  France were  saved.  Another  3,000  were sent  off  to\nAuschwitz, where  most of them  died. The remaining  3,000 either\nescaped  across the  border into  Spain or  fled to  the area  of\nsouthern France occupied  by the Italians, who  treated Jews much\nbetter than  the Nazis did.  At the  end of 1943,  however, Italy\nfell out of the war, and that was the end for those Jews as well.\nIncidentally, the Turkish diplomats  in Nazi-occupied Greece also\nworked to rescue Jews in that country.\n\n- The second part of your  book then deals with Turkish diplomats\nacting to  rescue Jews of  Turkish citizenship or  Turkish origin\nfrom Nazi persecution.\n\nYes,  and  there  is  an  aside   I  might  add  here:  In  their\ninterventions on  behalf of Turkish  Jews, the Turks  cited their\ntreaty with Germany which stated  that Turkish citizens in German\nterritory would be treated the same as German citizens in Turkey.\nOn  that basis  the Turks  maintained  that the  Nazis could  not\ndiscriminate  against Turkish  citizens who  are Jews.  The Nazis\nclaimed  (and the  Vichy government  agreed) that  they were  not\ndiscriminating  because  they  were treating  all  Jews  equally.\nTurkey  protested,   saying,  \"You  are  dividing   our  citizens\naccording to religion, but the Turkish constitution requires that\nall  citizens   be  treated  equally,  regardless   of  religion.\nTherefore, you cannot single  out Turkish Jews.\" American consuls\nin  Paris,  by contrast,  accepted  the  Nazi argument  and  told\nAmerican Jews  who were being  persecuted by the Nazis  that they\ncouldn't do  anything about  it, because  the American  Jews were\nbeing treated the same as other  Jews. The third part of the book\ntakes place in Turkey, which  was the principal center during the\nHolocaust for activities aimed at  the rescue of Eastern European\nJews. The  kwish Agency, an  organization established by  Jews in\nPalestine to help resettle Jews to Palestine, set up an office in\nIstanbul  in 1940  under the  leadership of  Chaim Barlas.  Other\nJewish organizations in Palestine, especially the kibbutzes, also\nsent representatives  to Istanbul  to set up  headquarters. These\ngroups first tried to contact Jews  in Eastern Europe to find out\nwhat was  happening. Today  we know about  the Holocaust,  but at\nthat  time people  didn't know  what  was going  on. They  didn't\nimagine the Nazis could do the things they were doing. And so the\nfirst step was to get information, and the Turkish government let\nthem use the Turkish mails to send letters to their relatives and\nfriends  in Eastern  Europe. The  Jewish organizations  found out\nwhat was happening when they  received replies. Later on when the\nNazis  began  to  intercept   such  letters,  the  Jews  received\nassistance  also from  the  Vatican nuncio,  Angelo Roncali,  who\nserved as  the Vatican  representative in  Istanbul from  1935 to\n1944  and   later  became  Pope   John  XXIII.  As   the  Vatican\nrepresentative  during the  war, he  used the  facilities of  the\nCatholic  Church to  supplement what  the Turkish  government was\ndoing to  assist Jewish  agencies in  contacting Jews  in Eastern\nEurope.  With the  cooperation of  the Turkish  government, these\nagencies  then  sent  hard  currency, food,  clothing,  and  even\nrailroad  and  steamship  tickets   to  Jews  in  Czechoslovakia,\nBulgaria, Romania, and Hungary. They weren't able to help much in\nPoland because  by then the  Nazis had  wiped out almost  all the\nPolish Jews.  Whenever possible the rescue  agencies arranged for\nthe Jews to get out of Eastern Europe either by train through the\nso called  Orient Express route  to Istanbul, or by  boat through\nthe Black Sea to Istanbul.\n\nTurkey was not eager for all  these refugees to remain within its\nborders during  the war, because  it was being blockaded  and was\nsuffering   terrible  shortages   of  food   and  clothing.   The\ngovernment,   therefore,   facilitated   the  movement   of   the\nnon-Turkish Jewish  refugees from Turkey to  Palestine, either by\nthe Taurus  Express Railroad through  the mountains to  Syria and\nPalestine,  or by  small boats  across the  eastern Mediterranean\nfrom southern  Turkey to  Palestine. These efforts  were bitterly\nopposed not only  by the Nazis, but also by  the British, who did\nnot want  any more Jewish  immigration to Palestine  because they\nfeared it would hurt their  relations with the Arabs. The British\nconstantly pressured the Turkish  government to stop this traffic\nand send those Jews back. In  a few cases the Turkish government,\nyielding  to  British pressure,  did  send  the boats  back.  For\nexample, in  one incident,  the steamship  Struma, with  some 700\nJewish  refugees  from Romania,  was  sent  back by  the  Turkish\ngovernment  as  a  result  of the  intervention  of  the  British\nambassador. When  that ship was  sunk by a Soviet  submarine, all\nwere lost except one person.  Nevertheless, all told, the Turkish\ngovernment allowed no fewer than 100,000 Eastern European Jews to\npass through  Turkish territory and  move on to  Palestine during\nthe Second World War. The Turkish authorities also provided these\nrefugees with facilities  and money, and gave  them permission to\nsend money and food out of the country.\n\n- Many  of these  Jews who  passed  through Turkey  may still  be\nliving in Israel.\n\nYes, and  their children. But  let's return  for a moment  to the\nfirst group, the Turkish Jews who  came from Europe. They did not\ngo  on  to   Palestine;  they  stayed  in  Turkey.   It  was  the\nnon-Turkish, Eastern  European Jews who passed  through Turkey en\nroute to Palestine. Their story is very interesting.\n\n- And you have rescued it from obscurity.\n\nMany studies have been made of the Holocaust, but most of them do\nnot focus on the Eastern European or Middle Eastern Jews. Most of\nthe scholarship  has centered  on the  Western European  Jews, of\nwhom 6 million were massacred by the Nazis. My study deals with a\nmuch smaller  number of  people. I  have tried  to round  out the\npicture,  and I  hope my  book  will persuade  other scholars  to\nundertake further investigations in the history of Eastern Jews.\n\nWhen it  comes to numbers,  the German Jews were  also relatively\nsmall in number. Most of the millions slain were Polish Jews. The\nrescue  of  100,000  Eastern  European   Jews  may  not  seem  so\nsignificant  compared  with  the  total of  6  million  who  were\nmurdered, but it meant a lot to those who were saved.\n\nAbout  three-fourths   of  the  book  consists   of  documents  -\ntranslations  of many  documents. They  are included  because the\nstory is not well known. Not  only are people in the West unaware\nof  the courageous  actions of  the Turkish  diplomats; even  the\npeople of Turkey  did not know the story. I  felt that they would\nnot  fully understand  this  remarkable  achievement unless  they\ncould see the documents.\n\n- What languages are used in the documents?\n\nMost of them are in Turkish  or French; some are in Hebrew. There\nis a great  deal of material in Hebrew about  the organization of\nthe boats  going to Palestine, the  passengers, and so on,  but I\ndid not go into those details extensively. I describe mostly what\nTurkey did, so  most of my documents are in  Turkish or French. A\nfew documents are  in English. The Jewish groups  in Istanbul did\nnot necessarily  cooperate with  one another  to rescue  Jews; in\nfact, they often fought with  one another. They took turns trying\nto  get  the  Turkish  government to  deport  rival  groups.  For\nexample, some of  the kibbutz groups felt that  the Jewish Agency\nwas  run by  Western European  Jews who  were interested  only in\nhelping  Western  European  Jews.  Finally,  in  1944,  President\nRoosevelt sent a personal  representative, Ira Hirschman, who had\nbeen an executive of Bloomingdale's  department store in New York\nCity, and  Hirschman managed to reconcile  their differences. The\ndocuments related to his mission are in English.\n\nI also obtained many documents  from Serge Klarsfeld, a Holocaust\nhistorian in France,  who mainly worked on the  French Jews. (His\nfather was  killed by  the Nazis.)  He gave  me materials  he had\ngathered in the German archives on  the Turkish Jews, so I didn't\npersonally consult the German archives.  I believe that much more\ncan  be learned  from the  German  archives, and  I hope  someone\nsomeday will make the effort.\n\n- This new book fits in well with your teaching, doesn't it?\n\nRight. I'm  giving a  course on  the history of  the Jews  of the\nOttoman  Empire.  I first  gave  the  course  two years  ago.  In\naddition to  research, writing, and teaching,  I've been actively\ninvolved in  the commemoration  of the  500th anniversary  of the\ncoming of the  Jews to the Ottoman Empire. Among  other things, I\nhelped organize  a large international conference  on the subject\nwhich was held in Istanbul in 1992.\n\n- Now that your  books are finished and the  conference has taken\nplace, what do you plan to do next?\n\nI'm working on two new books. One is a history of the Turkish War\nfor Independence, which took place  after World War I, during the\nyears  1918 to  1923. The  Turks warded  off the  efforts of  the\nvictorious  European   powers  to  occupy  Turkey   and  end  its\nindependence. The  second book is  a study of Sultan  Abdul Hamid\nII, the last major sultan, who ruled from 1876 to 1909. He was an\nimportant modernizer in his own  way, although he also suppressed\nall sorts of political movements.\n\nStanford  J. Shaw  received  a B.A.  in History  and  an M.A.  in\nBritish History. He then shifted to Near Eastern History, earning\na second M.A.  and a Ph.D. at Princeton. As  a doctoral candidate\nat Princeton, he  spent two years abroad, studying  at the School\nof  Oriental  and  African  Studies, University  of  London;  the\nUniversity of  Cairo, the American  University at Cairo,  and the\nUniversity of  Istanbul. He  taught at  Harvard before  coming to\nUCLA in 1966. His postdoctoral research has been supported by the\nJohn Simon Guggenheim Foundation, the American Research Institute\nin  Turkey, the  Social  Science Research  Council, the  National\nEndowment for the Humanities, the Fulbright Program, and ISOP. He\nhas  received  honorary  degrees   from  Harvard  University  and\nBosporus University, Bebek, Istanbul, Turkey, and medals of honor\nfor lifetime contributions  to the fields of  Islamic and Turkish\nstudies from the Center for Research in Islamic History, Art, and\nCulture in  Istanbul and from  the American Friends of  Turkey in\nWashington,  D.C. In  addition to  undertaking many  professional\nservice activities and public lectures  in both the United States\nand Turkey,  Shaw has  also produced eight  books and  one edited\nvolume. His  History of  the Ottoman Empire  and Modem  Turkey (2\nvols.)  has been  published  in many  editions  (six editions  or\nreprints  from 1977-1991),  and  translated  into Turkish  (1983,\n1991) and French (1984). His book  The Jews of the Ottoman Empire\nand  the  Turkish  Republic  (MacMillan,  London,  and  New  York\nUniversity Press, 1992) will  be published in Turkish translation\nby the Turkish  Historical Society, Istanbul. His  Turkey and the\nHolocaust: Turkey's  Role in Rescuing Turkish  and European Jewry\nfrom Nazi  Persecution, 1933-1945 will be  published by Macmillan\nPublishers,  London, and  New York  University Press  in 1993.  A\npamphlet summarizing the book was published in Ankara, Turkey, in\n1992.\n\nSerdar Argic"},{"role":"assistant","content":"talk.politics.mideast"}]}

I'm >philosophically< opposed to it\nbecause of its complexity.\n\nThis complexity has led to some programs' poor TIFF writers making\nsome very bizarre files, other programs' inability to load TIFF\nimages (though they'll save them, of course), and a general\ninability to interchange images between different environments\ndespite the fact they all think they understand TIFF.\n\nAs the saying goes, \"It's not me I'm worried about- it's all the\nabuse of TIFF over the years, and I chalk it all up to the immense (and\nunnecessary) complexity of the format.\n\nIn the words of the TIFF 5.0 spec, Appendix G, page G-1 (capitalized\nemphasis mine):\n\n\"The only problem with this sort of success is that TIFF was designed\nto be powerful and flexible, at the expense of simplicity.  It takes a\nfair amount of effort to handle all the options currently defined in\nthis specification (PROBABLY NO APPLICATION DOES A COMPLETE JOB),\nand that is currently the only way you can be >sure< that you will be\nable to import any TIFF image, since there are so many\nimage-generating applications out there now.\"\n\n\nIf a program (or worse all applications) can't read >every< TIFF\nimage, that means there are some it won't- some that I might have to\ndeal with.

As published in \"US Industrial Outlook 1993\" \n(which was released in January), revenues from the 1993 US space \nbusiness are currently projected to be about $4,890 M. \n   In contrast to previous years when US commercial space sales had \nshown double digits growth rates, this year's projected results are \ndriven by the US satellite manufacturing industry, where sales are \nprojected to drop from 12 satellites worth $1,300 M in 1992 to 7 \nsatellites worth $ 670 M in 1993.  The US Industrial Outlook also \nprojects U.S. commercial launchers faces flat demand in coming year, \nand while predicting that 1993 revenues will increase 10 percent to \n$450 M, future sales will be \"adversely affected by the downward \nrevision in Department of Defense launch plans.\"                           \n   Offsetting flat launch revenues and satellite deliveries, \nrevenues for fixed and mobile satellite services are projected to \nincrease to $1,900 M, primarily driven by increased revenues from \nbroadcast and cable TV networks.  Similarly, remote sensing products \nand sales are projected to increase to $250 M in 1993 (up 15%). \n\n US COMMERCIAL SPACE REVENUES     1989  1990   1991 1992(r) 1993(e)\n Commercial satellites             900 1,000  1,100  1,300     670\n Satellite services                750   800  1,200  1,500   1,900\n   Fixed                          (700) (735)(1,115)(1,275) (1,520)\n   Mobile                          (50) ( 65)(   85)(  225) (  380)\n Satellite ground equip            790   860  1,350  1,400   1,560\n   Mobile equipment                (40)  (85)  (280)  (352)    ???\n Commercial launches               150   570    380    450     450\n Remote sensing data and services  125   155    190    215     250\n Private microgravity research lab  --    --     --     --      60\n                                 ===== =====  ======  =====   =====\n   TOTAL ANNUAL REVENUES         2,715 3,385   4,220  4,815   4,890\n        (r) = revised data for 1992   (e) = estimated data for 1993\n   [Commentary: This is the first look at how the US commercial \nspace industry is expected to do in 1993.  In general, not a bad \nreport -- with most of the bad news concentrated in the satellite \nmanufacturing area.  There, changes of only a few satellites worth \n$100 M or so apiece can substantially influence the annual \nprojection.  If we look forward over several years, this market \nsector should retain strong sales as US firms have been very \nsuccessful in regaining international market share in the satellite \nbusiness. \n   Furthermore, sales of satellite ground equipment should go up in \nthe next revision of this data, expected to be released about mid-\nyear.  Data on mobile satellite ground equipment sales (including \nsuch items as GPS receivers and portable satellite terminals) \nappears to be missing from the January data set.  DoC usually \npublishes a listing of  \"Space Business Indicators\" in mid-year, and \nthe next revision of commercial space revenues should be released \nthen.  I expect the revised revenues should easily top $5,000 M, if \nthe mobile satellite ground equipment are added back into the \nnumbers, and the year should show about a 10% overall market growth. \n   Looking beyond this year's data, future markets look quite \npromising.  The DoC projects satellite service revenues could top \n$3,000 M by 1995 if new mobile satellite services and direct \nbroadcasting are implemented as planned, and that mobile satellite \nstation sales are expected to continue to growth at 15-20 % per year \nthrough the mid 1990's.  My numbers are somewhat more pessimistic \nfor near-term market growth, but I agree the trend should be for \nsubstantial growth in US commercial space sales over at least the \nnext 5-10 years.  (My pessimism is due to more conservative \nassumptions on market capture and growth in LEO communications and \nsatellite direct broadcasting services.  I don't believe all of the \ncurrent players in the yet-to-be-born LEO communications satellite \nmarket and in the yet-to-be-proven direct broadcasting market will \nbe financial successes, nor that sales growth will be as explosive \nas currently projected.) \n   It should also be noted this year's DoC data is the first \nrelease to show revenues from privately funded microgravity research \nfacilities.  The $60 M shown in the Janurary data is primarily for \nthe Spacehab module, planned for launch in April on the Space \nShuttle, but also hidden in these numbers are the projected first \nsales from the COMET orbital launch and recovery experiment module.] \n\n2- DELTA WINS TWO KEY LAUNCH CONTRACTS\n   McDonnell Douglas Corporation, which builds and markets the Delta \nlaunch vehicle has won two important launch contracts.  Motorola \nInc. announced in mid February that it had selected the Delta to \nlaunch most of the satellites in the 66-satellite Iridium LEO \ncommunications constellation, and in mid April, McDonnell Douglas \nwas awarded the USAF Medium Launch Vehicle III contract. \n   The launch services contract with Motorola for the Iridium \nconstellation launch is for at launch of least 45 Iridium \nsatellites.  Another 21 satellites have been contracted to be \nlaunched by Khrunichev Enterprise in Russian on 3 Proton vehicle \nlaunches.  These 45 satellites planned for the Delta will be \nlaunched 5 at a time,  providing for at least 9 launches.  \nAdditional satellites in the Iridium constellation, such as a \nplanned on-orbit spares, may also be launched on Delta.  Although \ndetails of the launch services contract were reported to be \nnegotiation, and not yet final. \n   The USAF MLV contract also went to MDC, bidding a variant of \ntheir Delta II launcher.  This contract is only initially worth $7.5 \nmillion, but establishes a set of launch options for up to 36 \nlaunches, encompassing launches from 1996 through 2002.  These \nlaunches will deploy the next generation of the USAF's Global \nPositioning System Block IIR navigation satellites, plus other \nprograms.  First option for to meet the USAF launch options is \nexpected to be exercised this year, after which the USAF is expected \nto request launches of up to 6 Deltas per year for at least 6 years.  \nUnder this contract the USAF can also request \"launch on demand\" \nservices from MDC for the 1996-2002 time period, with a launch to \noccur within 40 days of the request. \n    [Commentary:  If these two contracts are fulfilled, they should \nprovide an excellent business base for MDC's Delta launch program \nthrough the turn of the century.  Combined, these two contracts have \na potential for about 45 launches, worth about $2,200 M to MDC, and \nsustaining a core business base of $300-400 M/year.  Other contracts \nfor international and commercial payloads, as well as for NASA \nMedium ELV-class payloads, will add to this business base -- keeping \nMDC as a viable commerical launch company. \n    However, it should be noted there are risk elements in these \ncontracts.  Motorola's Iridium LEO communications constellation has \nnot yet received a US Federal Communications Commission license for \noperation in the U.S., nor has Motorola lined up all the financing \nand financial partners for the Iridium venture.  Without these \napprovals or financial backing there will be no Iridium launches.  \nBut, hopefully, these uncertainties will be settled this year. \n   Similarly, the USAF MLV III program has been the target of \nseveral Congressional actions which have slowed the production of \nthe GPS Block IIR satellites and deleted the funding for the MLV III \nprogram in favor of the USAF NLS/\"Spacelifter\" program.  At this \ntime, while it appears the MLV III contract will be executed, future \nfunding for the MLV III and other USAF commercial launch contracts \nis being reconsidered as part of national space launch strategy \nreviews.  Some opinions expressed from within the Administration and \nCongress propose cancellation of all \"ELV upgrade\" programs \n(including the MLV programs) in favor of the proposed \"Spacelifter\" \nprogram.  Such opinions may have some weight in this year's budget \ndeliberations, particularly as DoD funds will be more difficult to \nfind in the shrinking US Defense budget.] \n \n3- COMMERCIAL REMOTE SENSING VENTURE GETS DOC \"GO-AHEAD\"\n   The first commercial license to operate a remote sensing \nsatellite was approved in early February by the US Department of \nCommerce's Office of Space Commerce.  A license was granted to \nWorldView Imaging Corporation of Oakland, California to build and \noperate a pair of LEO imaging satellites to provide multi-spectral \nimages of the Earth. \n   [Commentary:  There has been little data released on this venture \nby WorldView and the DoC, other than the announcement of the \noperating and construction license.  This was reported to be at the \nrequest of WorldView.  Most industry speculation identifies this new \nventure as a \"Star Wars\" spinoff, using SDI-type technology to \nprovide digital Earth sensing data, and heavily integrated into \ndigital GIS databases for remote sensing/GIS users.  Most probable \ncustomers for this service include exploration geologists, \nagricultural planners, and urban planners.  \n   It is noteworthy this is the first commercial venture under the \n1992 Land Remote Sensing Policy Act.  The Act, as passed last \nNovember, provides that remote sensing data gathered from private remote \nsensing craft may be sold to users at differing prices.  Prior to \nthis act, remote sensing data from all satellites had to be sold to \nall users at the same prices, and private remote sensing ventures \nwould have had to sell at the government-set Landsat data prices. \n   There are rumors of several other potential commercial remote \nsensing ventures working their way through the system at different \nstages of development.  I think the large Landsat and SPOT satellite \nsystems will provide the majority of the satellite remote sensing \ndata market for the next decade or so.  In contrast to these large, \ngovernment-sponsored remote sensing systems, smaller market ventures \nsuch as WorldView and others can exploit market niches and use \ninnovative technology, and I believe, can find profitability on the \nmargin.  I predict there may be some very interesting ventures \nappearing in the next year or so.] \n                 \n4- INVESTMENT FIRM CALLS GD'S SPACE BIZ \"STILL A GOOD INVESTMENT\" \n   Wall Street investment house Morgan Stanley thinks General \nDynamic's Space Systems Division could still be a moneymaker, \ndespite having failed in the last 3 Atlas launches.  In a recent \nanalyst's report Morgan Stanley said \"We are more than ever \nconvinced that if the company can return the Atlas to its historical \n95%-plus success rate, this will become a highly profitable, cash-\ngenerating unit.\"  Based upon discussions with GD's corporate \nmanagement, Morgan Stanley projects that if the Atlas problems are \ncleared up the unit could see $70 M in earnings per year by 1995 and \n$100 M per year by 2000.  This is based upon GD's projection of \ncapturing about 10 Atlas launches per year on the world market. \n   [Commentary:  Three failures in a row of their launch system has \nhurt General Dynamic's Space Systems Division.  Since GD has \nrestructured to only keep a very few profitable core businesses, \nmany market pundits have been speculating GD's space business might \nbe next to be sold.  The Morgan Stanley report indicates GD's Space \nSystems Division has some potential as a moneymaker, despite current \nproblems -- if they can get their act together.  Sales are projected \nto be about $560 M in 1993, which will probably generate a loss of \nabout $25 M.  If GD can capture their projected share of the space \nlaunch market, and if they have managed to clean up the reliability \nof their Atlas launchers, then they could generate healthy profits \nfrom those sales.  But until they demonstrate the Atlas Centaur \nprogram is back on track, this division will continue to show \nsubstantial losses. \n   In response to the sell-off rumors, in my opinion, this operation \nis not a really good candidate for takeover and quick profitability.  \nTo do such a takeover, the current set corporate and divisional \nmanagement would be replaced with another set from outside the firm.  \nIn GD SSD's case, to get the division back on track, the management \nteam will have to concentrate hard on the technical problems with \nthe Atlas Centaur, as well as in selling Atlas services.  This would \nindicate only another firm with experience in rocket launch \noperations could find such talent in-house, and be able to convince \ncustomers to buy their launch services.  Optimally, the firm would \nhave substantial liquid rocket experience, and experience in \nmarketing space technology internationally as well.  Candidates for \nthis might be TRW, Rockwell, Lockheed, and Martin, and possibly \nMcDonnell Douglas and Boeing.  But most of those firms have cash \nflow problems (MDC), have had a substantial business contraction \n(Boeing and MDC), are involved with other launch firms (Lockheed), \nor have taken on substantial debt (Martin).  And coming up with the \n$700-1500 M purchase price for the division is a big chunk of \nchange for any company.] \n \n5 - ARIANE PREDICTS DIP IN LAUNCH DEMAND\n   Arianespace, the operator of the Ariane launch system, is \nprojecting a dip in launch demand in the late 1990's.  In early \nFebruary, Arianespace released their annual market survey, which \ndetailed their projection of the space transportation market for the \nnext decade. \n   Over short run, Arianespace expects to retain their dominant \nposition and sustain a majority share of the launch market.  Of 54 \ninternational and commercial launches planned through 1995, Ariane \nholds contracts for 31, General Dynamics' Atlas vehicle holds 14 \ncontracts, McDonnell Douglas' Delta holds 7, and Great Wall's Long \nMarch vehicle holds 2 launch contracts. \n   Three-quarters of future launch contracts for which Ariane can \ncompete are projected to come from communications satellites with \nthe remaining 25% split between weather, Earth observation, and \nscientific satellites.  Most of the future telecommunications demand \ngrowth is predicted to come from the Asia/Pacific region. \n   Arianespace expects the current market consolidation of \nindividual satellite operators into regional or national groups will \ncontinue, with these groups investing in heavier satellites with \nlarger communications payloads carrying more transponders. \nArianespace predicts the average mass of telecommunications \nsatellites should increase by 20 % over today's average level, to \nabout 3000 kg in GEO. \n   Demand for commercial launch services is expected to remain \nstrong over the next three years, but in the second half of the \ndecade, Arianespace predicts demand will decrease.  Arianespace \nbases this prediction upon a matching of satellite transponder \ndemand and supply,  particularly as new data compression techniques \nappear to could double or triple transponder capacity using existing \nor near-term transponders. \n   One of the significant possible changes in the market was \nidentified as the arrival of new launch vehicles, including Russian \nlaunch systems.  But Arianespace predicts that in the long term, \ninvestors purchasing launch services are looking for the best trade \noff between launch service quality and price, and that Russian and \nother new launch services will have to prove out their capabilities \nand service quality, and their market penetration will be minimal. \n   [Commentary:  Ariane releases their market surveys annually, and \nI reported on their prior market survey in a past issue of CSN/STI.  \nComparing the two surveys, there aren't outstanding differences in \nthe numbers.   The most notable change is the consideration of new \ndata compression techniques, reducing the demand for new physical \ntransponders on orbit.\n   I note that in contrast to some predictions, demand for space-\nbased communications transponders appears to be remain strong. While \nfiber optic lines are making substantial inroads into the \nestablished point-to-point telecommunications markets, growing \ndemand for telecommunications services world wide and for point-to-\nmultipoint broadcast services have prevented a decrease in space \ntransponder demand.  Fiberoptic cables provide a higher capability \nservice, but only from established point A to established point B. \nTo establish a fiberoptic link it is necessary to install cable \nbetween the points, and while there are improved network solutions, \ninstalling a large network of distributed fiberoptic links can cost \nmillions or billions of dollars.  \n   For broadcast services where there is not an existing ground \nnetwork structure, satellites still offer the most cost effective \nsolution.  And if new services are required into a new region, it is \ncheaper to install a small satellite link costing only a few tens of \nthousands of dollars and tie into the existing global satellite \nnetwork.  This allows rapid growth of new satellite services, and \nhas kept demand high.  The replacement market for fiberoptics is \ngrowing as well, since as demand grows between the points serviced, \nit becomes cost effective to later install a fiberoptic link to \nhandle the increase in traffic. \n   Since the telecommunications and data transfer markets are still \ngrowing rapidly, satellite market projections remain rosy.  But \nsatellites are also getting longer orbital lifetimes.  Current \ngeneration satellites are now getting guarantees of at 15 years of \non-orbit service or more, in contrast to 10 years of service from \nlast generation's satellites.  This has cut back some of the launch \ndemand, as satellite owners are rescheduling replacement satellite \nlaunches over longer intervals. \n   And as last note; Arianespace didn't flag it this year, but it \nlooks like the space transportation market will be rather over-\nsupplied by existing launch systems in the near term.  The annual \ncommercial launch demand is for about 15-20 medium sized satellites \nper year.  From the supply side, Ariane is capable of launching up \nto about a dozen medium sized satellites a year, Delta is capable of \nabout 9-12 per year, Atlas is capable of 6-12, Long March 4-8, \nJapan's H-Vehicle 2-4, Russia's Proton capable of 8, and other \nsystems such as Zenit and Soyuz another 10-20 medium launches per \nyear.  That's a lot of capability for a small market. \n   We can only expect the competition to intensify for commercial \nlaunches.]\n\n6- NTSB INVESTIGATES PEGASUS LAUNCH OVER ABORTED ABORT \n   The 9 Feb Pegasus launch by Orbital Sciences Corporation has \nspawned an investigation over an apparent violation of range safety \nrules.  A valid abort order from a NASA range safety officer to halt \nthe mission was overridden and the Pegasus was launched in violation \nof range safety rules.  \n   In the last few minutes of the Pegasus launch countdown, one of \ntwo abort command receivers aboard the Pegasus failed.  Such a failure \ntypically scrubs a launch,and a NASA range safety officer at \nWallops Island, VA issued a mission abort order about a minute \nbefore the scheduled Pegasus launch.  Somehow this command was \noverridden by the OSC launch team or the message was lost in the \ncommunications channels, and the Pegasus was launched despite the \nvalid abort call. \n   Fortunately, the Pegasus functioned as expected, and the abort \ncommand receiver was not needed.  But this incident did spark an \ninvestigation since a valid abort order was given under agreed-to \nlaunch constraint rules, and was not obeyed. \n   Leading the investigation is the National Transportation Safety \nBoard (NTSB) with support from NASA, OSC, and the Air Force.  This \ninvestigation marks the first time NTSB has taken the lead on an \nincident involving a space launch.  According to the NTSB, their \ninvestigation will take about 6 months, and is primarily looking at \nlines of authority, communications links and safety procedures used \nin the launch. \n  [Commentary: This is the first time that the NTSB has led an \ninvestigation into a space launch.  Their leadership was requested \nby the Department of Commerce's Office of Commercial Space \nTransportation, who had licensed the commercial launch.  \n   At the time of writing this column, some of the initial \ninvestigations have been concluded, and some of the results are \nstarting to leak out into the trade press.  Apparently, 3 or four \ndifferent communications channels were in use during the test. After \nthe abort destruct receiver stopped responding, the NASA test \ndirector and range controller in the Mission Control room at Wallops \nIsland gave abort orders about a minute before the launch.  \nAccording to the mission rules, this should have stopped the launch. \nSomehow, the OSC test conductor ordered the abort reversed, and the \nNASA communicator on the net relayed that order to the B-52 carrying \nthe Pegasus at about 22 seconds before launch.  Differing \nexplainations of exactly how this happened are proposed -- with the \nbest set being that clear lines of communications and clear \ndefinition of the responsibilities of the mission control team, and \nunderstanding of the mission rules were not established before the \nlaunch.  \n   As we see more and more commercial launches, more of these \nprocedural issues are going to crop up and will have to be resolved.   \nThis case is interesting because it is the first time the NTSB has \nbeen called in to investigate a commercial launch problem (as they \ndo with commercial aircraft problems).  \n   I think this problem will turn out to be primarily problems with \nprocedures and communications, and will be cleared up with issuance \nof guidelines on how launch communications should be set up and how \nspecific lines of authority should be delineated.] \n\n7- ANOTHER PEGASUS COMPETITOR IS ANNOUNCED\n   Tsniimach Enterprise in Russia announced it is marketing a new \nsmall space launch system, based upon converted ICBM components.  \nTwo versions of the launcher are being marketed: the \"Aerokosmos\" \nwinged vehicle launched like the OSC Pegasus, and the \"Severkosmos\", \nlaunched from a mobile ground transporter.  The Aerokosmos is \nprojected to deliver 900 kg to a 200 km circular orbit or 580 kg to \nan 800 km circular orbit, and the Severkosmos to be capable of 430 \nkg to 200 km orbits and 225 kg to 800 km.  Also proposed to be used \nwith these launch systems is a LEO data relay system called \n'Sineva'.  Tsniimach Enterprise is described as a ex-military \nestablishment, focusing on aerodynamics and thermal protection of \nspacecraft and which has participated in the development of the \nBuran shuttle system,  They are located near the NPO Energia \nfacility in Kaliningrad, outside of Moscow. \n   [Commentary: There's very little released information on this new \nventure.  My suspicion is it is another Russian enterprise looking \nfor hard currency and trying to capitalize upon their in-house \nknowledge of ex-Soviet launch systems.  It adds to the list of numerous \ncommercial space startups announced from the ex-Soviet Union. \n   This one's a little different in that they are offering variants \nof ex-Soviet ICBMs, but I can't identify any key customers being \ntargeted or substantial financial backing.]\n\n8- GEORGIA LAUNCH SITE DROPPED FROM PLANNING\n   In late January, Georgia Tech Research Institute released the \nresults of a preliminary study on the feasibility of a commercial \nrocket launching site in Camden County, Georgia at the old Kingsland \nMissile Test Launching Site on the Atlantic coast.  The preliminary \nstudy recommended the site not be pursued as a commercial launch \nsite, stating reopening the site was not feasible due to projected \nlow investment returns, plus environmental and other geographic \nconsiderations.  However, the report did say the site might be ideal \nfor other aerospace uses, and recommended other potential uses. \n   [Commentary:  This should put the nails in the coffin of the \nKingsland Commercial Launch Site.  While other sites are still \nproceeding with commercial launch site development plans, Kingsland \nfound without a key customer to act as anchor tenant, and if \nsubstantial infrastructure had to be put in, then the expected \nreturns were too low to justify the cost of development.  \n   This might point out some key discriminators in judging the \nfeasibility of a commercial launch site.  These include:\n  - Is there an identified key customer to provide core usage \nsufficient to recover setup costs?\n  - Is there a market advantage of using the site?\n  - Can existing infrastructure be used or modified at the site?\n  - Can financing be found at low enough cost to support the \ninvestment?  \n   Other commercial launch site ventures -- including those at \nWoomera, Poker Flat, Cape York, White Sands, Alabama Off-Shore \nPlatform, Hawaii, and Vandenberg have to also be judged against \nthese criteria.  In my opinion, some of these ventures are flying \non hope and speculation, and not on sound financial grounds.]\n\n9- SPAIN'S CAPRICORNIA LAUNCHER STILL PROCEEDING\n   In one of his last official acts, former President Bush \nauthorized space technology transfer for several joint space \nventures between US and other firms.  One of these was a proposed \nuse of US technology by Spain to build a small booster.  With that \nregulatory impediment removed, the 3-stage Capricornia launch \nvehicle will start development later this year, planning for a first \nlaunch in the 1995/96 time period.  The Capricornia is described as \na small 3-stage all solid booster designed to put 250-500 Kg into \nLEO.  Several launch sites are being examined for the system, \nincluding 2 on the Iberian peninsula and 1 on the Canary Islands.  \nOriginated by INTA in Spain, the project reports it has $ 30 M in \ndevelopment funding, and will use technology from Argentina's Condor \nlaunch vehicle as well as from the US. \n   [Commentary:  Several firms have identified a market opportunity \nin providing a small launcher for the European market.  Small \npayloads from European firms or organizations currently use either \nAriane piggyback launches or the US/Italian Scout launcher.  \nHowever, Ariane piggyback opportunities are limited, and the Scout \nprogram is being phased out (accompanied by some disarray in the \nItalian government and space industry regarding any follow-on \nsystem).  \n   This has left an apparent niche for a new European small launch \nsystem.  Surprisingly enough, ESA has not supported development of \nsuch a system within the current space funding structure.  Studies \nhave been performed by British Aerospace, Aerospatiale, Deutsche \nAerospace, and Italian organizations, but with the exception of the \nSwedish/PacAstro system (reported below), I have not been able to \nfind any other European development work with even a rumor of \nfunding for hardware. \n   Also of interest is the linking of the Capricornia to the \nArgentinian Condor launcher.  There have been some interesting \nrumors surfacing out of Argentina over the past year about a space \nlauncher/IRBM program funded under the military junta which ruled \nthe country in the 1970's and early 1980's. \n   What is known is in Feb 1992, the Argentinian Air Force formally \ntransferred control of the Condor 2 missile program to the new \ncivilian Argentinian national space agency (Comison Nacional de \nAtividades Espaciales - CNAE).  The Condor 2 program was described \nas originating in 1983, expanding upon the smaller Condor 1 rocket \nprogram in collaboration with Egypt and with support of German \nfirms.  The Condor 2 was also reportedly funded indirectly by Iraq \nin the mid-1980's.  Fairly large solid rocket motors were built and \ntested, but Argentinan development of a suitable guidance package \nlagged that of the propulsion system. \n   It should be noted CNAE is planning to launch its first \nscientific satellite in late 1994.  The US$ 9 M, 181 Kg, SAC-B \nsatellite will study the Earth's upper atmosphere and includes \ncooperative experiments from Italy and the US. No launch vehicle has \nyet been selected, but OSC's Pegasus and the Russian Burlak Air \nlaunched rocket are reported to be strong contenders for this \ncontract.] \n\n10- PACASTRO SIGNS LAUNCH RESERVATION WITH SWEDISH SPACE CORP\n   PacAstro, a small launch firm in Herndon, Virginia announced in \nlate February it had received a $6 M launch reservation contract \nfrom the Swedish Space Corp to launch a satellite on PacAstro's PA-2 \nlaunch vehicle.   This will be performed as part of the Polar \nSatellite Service (PSS), a joint Norwegian Space Center/ Swedish \nSpace Corp. program to upgrade the Andoya Rocket Range in Norway and \noffering small satellite launches into the polar regions.  According \nto PacAstro, PSS is also performing an $8 M upgrade of the Andoya \nlaunch facilities, including a new integration facility and a fully-\nenclosed vertical assembly building for small launch vehicles like \nthe PacAstro PA-2.  PacAstro has been chosen as \"the main \nalternative rocket supplier\" for the small satellite launch service \nto be offered by PSS from Andoya.  The date of the launch of the \nSwedish satellite was not specified. \n   [Commentary:  PacAstro has been trying to line up customers and \nfunding for their launch vehicle for some time now.  The PA-2 is a \nsmall, two stage rocket fueled by RP-1 and Liquid Oxygen.  From \nPacAstro's literature, the engines designed for the PA-series \nrockets are built of \"off the shelf\" components based upon the Lunar \nMOdule Descent Engines built by TRW, and are capable of putting a \n225 Kg satellite into a 750 km circular polar orbit.  \n   PacAstro is trying to arrange construction financing for its \nfirst three PA-2 vehicles, with a first launch planned for 1995, and \n2 orbital launches planned for 1996.  My records show PacAstro hired \nTRW to provide marketing support and systems design,  with primary \nengineering to be done by AeroAstro, a small satellite builder \nclosely associated with PacAstro (headquartered in the same \nbuilding).  The Swedish Space Corporation would supply engineering, \nlaunch operations, vehicle subsystems, and marketing support. \nSumitomo Corp. of Tokyo, is a first round investor and sits on the \nboard of directors.  \n   PacAstro has gotten a first round financial package of at least \n$550 K  (Some sources place this of high as $1 M), but has been \nsearching for about a year for the additional $20-30 M needed to \ndesign, build and launch their first set of vehicles. \n   The launch reservation from SSC can possibly be used to help \nbring some investors on board, but by my estimate, they will need \nmuch more than the single $6 M sale to put their venture into real \nhardware.] \n\n11- CHINA AND TAIWAN JOINT SATELLITE VENTURE REPORTED\n    In early March, it was reported a joint satellite communications \nventure between a Taiwanese and mainland Chinese was in the works.  \nAs reported in the Taipei press, China Development Corp. (CDC), \nheadquartered in Taiwam and with links to the ruling Nationalist \nParty, is planning to set up a joint venture in Hong Kong with China \nGreat Wall Industry Corp. with the objective of launching a regional \ncommunications satellite. CDC would cover about 10% of the satellite \nsystem cost (US $10 M) in exchange for rights to 10% of the \nsatellite's communications channels.  \n   [Commentary:  This announcement came close on the heels of the \nrelease of Taiwanese plans for space development (released in mid \nJanuary).   In those plans, the National Space Program Office of \nTaiwan will launch 3 satellites, starting with ROCSAT-1, a 400 Kg \nscientific spacecraft, planned for launch in 1997.  Two additional \nsatellites are planned, both communications satellites.   TRW has \nbeen helping Taiwan plan this program, budgeted at T$13.6 B (US $530 \nM) through 2006.  \n   I haven't been able to establish any relationship between this \nventure and those of the NSPOT, but there might be a connection.  \nWhile Taiwan has the financing to pursue several ventures, the \ncurrent Taiwanese telecommunications market might not support two \nseparate sastellite ventures. \n   The reported name for the Tiawanese/Chinese system is \"Asiasat-\n2\", but I don't thinks this has any relationship with the existing \nHong Kong-based \"Asiasat\" program involving Chinese, Hong Kong, and \nother Asian investors, other than using it as an organizational \nmodel.  There are some obvious advantages to pursuing such a joing \nventure -- it could provide excellent first-hand experience to \nTaiwan for a very low cost, which then can be used in later \nsatellite ventures.  But there are internal political issues between \nTaiwanese and Chinese ventures, but putting any joint venture \nthrough a  Hong Kong intermediary corporation might allow it to \nproceed. \n   In any case, the East Asian satellite market is lighting up with \nsubstantially growth projected in space services and revenues.  This \nis just another indicator to add to the list.] \n\n12- SOUTH KOREA ANNOUNCES NATIONAL MOVE INTO SPACE TECHNOLOGIES\n   South Korea's Trade, Industry and Resources Ministry recently \nannounced plans to invest US$22 B in research and development and \nanother US$17 B into manufacturing and research facilities for \nadvanced aerospace technologies.  Space technologies have been \nspecifically targeted as part of this program, beginning with \nmanufacture and launch of an advanced multi-purpose satellite by \n1997.  The objective of this investment is to raise South Korea's \naerospace technology to the level of the world's top 10 countries by \n2000.                                 \n   [Commentary: South Korea has been quietly working to develop its \nnational aerospace industry, specifically including space \nactivities. I'm noting this as a flag that potential new players are \ncoming into the commercial space market. \n   As part of their national effort, 2 national telecommunications \nsatellites for Korea Telecom will be launched in April and Oct 1995 \non Delta. Designated Koreasat 1 and 2, the platforms will provide \ntelevision and telephone service throughout the Korean Peninsula, \nsouthwestern Japan and portions of China bordering North Korea. \n   South Korea launched its first small satellite piggyback on \nAriane in Aug 1992, called Uribyol-1 (Our Star) and costing about US \n$8.8 M.  Uribyol-2 is planned for piggyback launch in October of \nthis year, again on Ariane, and will be entirely \"made in Korea.\"  \nUribyol-3, projected for a 1995 launch, will be an environment-\nmonitoring micro-satellite. \n   This satellite may be the precursor to a series of small Earth \nobservation satellites,  The KEOS (Korean Earth Observation System) \nproject, which has been submitted for approval to the South Korean \ngovernment, would use two or three 300-kg spacecraft equipped with \noptical and microwave sensors.\n   South Korean press reports claim there is also a parallel \nmilitary effort to establish the capabilities for building and \nlaunching small military satellites by 2001.  Supposedly a \ngovernment panel had been established to oversee such an effort, \nfunded at US $ 500 M between 1993 and 2001, in anticipation of an  \nexpected pullout of U.S. intelligence-gathering systems from the \nKorean peninsula.       \n   In conjunction with all of these reported efforts, South Korean \nis also pursuing production work either as off-sets to existing \naerospace technology contracts (for example, McDonnell Douglas is \noffsetting production of some Delta parts to South Korean firms as \npart of the Koreasat launch contracts), or for production of \nconsumer space items (among other products, South Korea exports \nsatellite receiver television setups to Japan, and Samsung has \nannounced teaming for production of OSC's Orbcomm user terminals.).  \n   This looks like a very aggressive push into space technologies.  \nConsidering that East Asia is currently the fastest growing sector \nfor commercial space services (primarily for telecommunications), a \nSouth Korean push into space technologies may change the composition \nof commercial space market there over the next decade.] \n\n13- SPACE TECHNOLOGY INDEXES THROUGH MARCH\n   As announced in the last CSN/STI, each issue will give the \nresults of stock indexes and portfolios regarding space stocks and \ninvestments.  The table below summarizes results to the end of \nMarch.  The Space Technology Index did quite a bit better than the \nmarket as a whole, as represented by the S&P 500 index.  Since 90+% \nof the values included in the index are US firms, this represents a \ngeneral increase in the market value of space-related firms.  The \nincrease in the first quarter is more than in all of 1992 -- which \nis a very promising sign, although future months may reverse this \ntrend. The Commercial Space Technology Index has also done quite \nwell, but the Pure Play portfolio -- consisting of stocks of firms \nwhich are pure plays in space technologies -- has also surpassed its \nresults in all of 1993.  We'll keep an eye on these ....\n\n   INDEX RESULTS THROUGH MARCH\n                           Beginning  Beginning      1 Jan 93 to\n                           1992       1993           31 Mar 1993\n                           -------    --------       --------\n   S&P 500                 416        436  (+4.7%)   452  (+3.7%)\n   Space Tech Index        267        304 (+13.6%)   373 (+22.7%)\n   Comm'l Space Tech Index 167        194 (+16.3%)   222 (+14.2%)\n   Space Tech Pure Plays   147        169 (+15.4%)   197 (+16.2%)\n\n\nFINAL NOTES - \n    What?

While the United States and 48 of the fifty states call their\n   highest court \"Supreme Court,\" \"Supreme Judicial Court\" or \"Supreme\n   Court of Appeals,\" Maryland and New York call theirs simply the\n   \"Court of Appeals.\"  To make matters worse, New York also calls its\n   _second-highest_ court the \"Supreme Court, Appellate Division\"...\n\nAtlantic Cement Co._, 26 N.Y.2d 219, 257 N.E.2d 870 (1970)):\n\nOscar H. Boomer, et al., owned land near the Atlantic Cement company's\nplant near Albany, N.Y.  (The fact pattern gives no information as to\nwhich came first, the plaintiff's acquisition of the land or he\ndefendant's start of production at their cement plant.)  In the course\nof its regular operations, the cement plant did injury to the\nplaintiffs' property via dirt, smoke and vibrations emanating from the\nplant.  The plaintiffs sought injunctive relief -- that is, they asked\nthe court to order Atlantic Cement to stop damaging their property.\n\n(Commentary: this seems entirely reasonable to me.  Boomer at al owned\ntheir property and, presumably, a right to quiet enjoyment of it.\nAtlantic Cement's actions were depriving Boomer et al of that right.)\n\nInstead of granting the plaintiffs' request for an injunction, the court\nordered them to accept the damage being done to their property, provided\nthat Atlantic Cement paid them $185,000 in compensatory damages.  In\nother words, the court granted Atlantic Cement Co., a private party, the\npower and authority to _take_ the plaintiffs rights to quiet enjoyment\nof their property by eminent domain.  A taking by eminent domain is\nalways problematical even when it's done by the state; allowing a\nprivate firm to do it is, in my opinion, totally wrong.\n\n(Yes, I know, the _Boomer_ court didn't call it eminent domain.  But if\nit walks like eminent domain and swims like eminent domain and quacks\nlike eminent domain...)\n\nLet me take issue with the way you've presented the case... you say that\n\"What happened in _Boomer_ was that the judge didn't allow the\nplaintiffs to blackmail the cement plant by demanding a multi-million\ndollar plant to be shut down over $185,000 in damages.\"  Blackmail?\n\n    (Pulls out Black's Law Dictionary, Abridged 5th Edition....\n    \"Blackmail: Unlawful demand of money or property under threat to\n    do bodily harm, to injure property, to accuse of crime, or to expose\n    disgraceful defects.  This crime is commonly included under\n    extortion statutes.\")\n\nHow do you define as \"blackmail\" one party's act of demanding the right\nto set its own sale price for a unique piece of property which it owns\nand which another party has expressed an interest in buying?  Or of\ndemanding the right not to sell that property at any price?  As I see\nit, Boomer et al, having found themselves in the fortunate position of\nowning something which Atlantic Cement had to purchase if it wanted to\nstay in business, had every right in the world to set whatever price\nthey wanted.  There isn't, or at least shouldn't be, any law that says\nthat you have to be a nice guy in your private business dealings.\n\nYou go on to say: \"The plant would never have been shut down -- the\nplaintiff's lawyers would have just negotiated a windfall settlement,\nbecause the plaintiffs would prefer an amount greater than $185K to\nhaving the plant shut down, while the plant would prefer any amount less\nthan the value of the plant to have the plant continue in operation.\"\n\nIf so, so what?  Since when are the courts supposed to be in the\nbusiness of preventing parties from reaping windfall settlements from\nother parties when those settlements arise from wrongful acts by those\nother parties?  If Atlantic Cement didn't want to have to face a choice\nbetween paying a windfall settlement or going out of business, well,\nshouldn't Atlantic Cement have thought of that before going _into_\nbusiness?  (I note that as far as the facts show Boomer et al were _not_\nthe parties responsible for bringing about this situation -- that was\nAtlantic Cement's own fault for choosing to build and operate the type\nof plant they did where and when they did.)\n\nAnd then you say: \"Everyone's property rights were protected; the\nplaintiffs were made whole; unnecessary settlement costs were avoided.\"\nAs above, I dispute your claim that the plaintiffs were \"made whole.\"\nThey were, in fact, by court action deprived of their rights as owners\nof property to choose to sell or not sell that property at a price\nacceptable to them.  And for that deprivation they were _not_ made\nwhole.  And again I ask: Since when are the courts supposed to be in the\nbusiness of ensuring that \"unnecessary\" settlement costs are avoided?\n(If so, I've been miseducated -- I always thought that the courts were\nsupposed to be in the business of ensuring that justice is done.)\n\n\n(1) _Boomer_ is not being taught as \"infamous,\" at least not at my\nschool.\n\n(Aside: Northeastern Law usually does a very good job of hiring for\ntheir first-year, mandatory classes (such as Torts, where I first\nencountered _Boomer_) instructors who, regardless of their personal\nopinions, can and do teach the law neutrally.  When the students get\ninto their second and third years, in which the students (a) can pick\nand choose which courses to take (except for the mandatory Professional\nResponsibility, of course) and (b) are presumed to be a bit more worldly\nand self-confident, less likely to be consciously or sub-consciously\nintimidated by Law School Professors and able to learn from openly\nbiased instructors rather than be indoctrinated by them, the instructors\ntend to be more open in expressing their own opinions.  This is\nespecially true of part-time instructors who, in real life, are\npracticing attorneys or sitting judges... this can be _very_\neducational, sometimes far more so than being taught by a somewhat\ncloistered scholar.  End of aside.)\n\nI called it infamous because that's my opinion of it.  For the reasons\nI've stated above, I believe it to be a triumph of something that I can\nonly call \"economic correctness\" over justice.\n\n(2) It is \"completely sensible\" only if you believe that the alleged\nright of the owners of Atlantic Cement to stay in business and avoid\nlosing a lot of their own money due to their own wrongful act, and\nthe alleged right of several hundred Atlantic Cement employees to\nnot have their jobs disappear, should trump the rights of people who\nown property which was damaged by Atlantic Cement's wrongful acts.\n(And if you believe that it is correct for the courts (or any other\nbranch of government) to grant to private parties the right to take\nother people's property by eminent domain.)\n\n\nReally?  I didn't know that... what, if anything, has he had to say\nabout cases like _Boomer_?\n\n\nI've admitted that my understanding of the field generally referred to\nas \"law and economics\" is weak.  If it advocates the use of economical\nanalysis as one of many \"tie-breaker\" factors which courts may use to\nhelp them reach decisions in cases in which the dispute, as measured by\nthe scale of \"justice\", is evenly balanced, fine.  But as illustrated by\n_Boomer_, it is _not_ fine when the courts start viewing the economics\nof a case as being more important than the justice of a case."},{"role":"assistant","content":"talk.politics.misc"}]}

If you are talking about \"taking the Lord's \nname in vain\" as a serious transgression, then this example is more a case of \nhypocrisy than of varying moral codes.\n \nIf there is an absolute moral code, propositions or laws in that code apply\nabsolutely and universally, by definition.  Conceivably some moral codes\ncould be subsets of the universal code, as you say at the outset.  So, for\nexample, God's code could include, \"Thou shalt not create Beings without\na hospitable planet to live on\", but this law would be inapplicable to us.\nNevertheless, we would be entitled to suppose that all laws applicable\nto us are also applicable to God.\n \nBut when you begin to ask what laws might appear in God's moral code, you have\na sense of the absurdity of the question.  Does God make laws for Himself to\nfollow?  Perhaps God is not the sort of being to which the category \"morality\"\ncan be sensibly applied."},{"role":"assistant","content":"talk.religion.misc"}]}

A good used car buy.\nThe MX-6 was almost there but rolled more than I liked.  \nI didn't like the Prelude dash/instrumentation at all.  Too weird for me.\nThe MR2 has a much smaller non-passenger space than I needed, so out that went.\nThe Celica was \"ok\" but underpowered when loaded with options (and somewhat\noverpriced too) in non-turbo form.\nI never considered the 240SX since it didn't have an airbag.  I did look at it\nfor its RWD virtues but that's it.  The Corolla never entered my mind.\nI should have looked at the Mitsubishi VR4/Dodge Stealth more.\nSince my list was exhausted, I bought the Probe.  :-)\n\nThe car design is different than earlier years, so it's too early to see its\nreliability so far.  For what it's worth, my comments:\n\nMy dislikes:\nShutting door with windows up from inside rarely makes good wind seal.\nHeadlights have \"stuck\" up a few times (weather?)\nair conditioning broke ~4000 miles (pressure cycling switch)\ncondensation around rear washer fluid container doesn't drain completely.\ncrammed engine; little hope for do-it-yourselfers (typical)\nparts somewhat more expensive than normal Ford parts\nunderside plastic doesn't like sharp driveways and speedbumps (typical).\nassembly gripes: tape on radiator, screw fell out of dash, seat seams not \nstitched properly.  Hopefully just a fluke.\nFord only gives 1 key with the car.  C'mon Ford, spend an extra few pennies!\nRear hatch has no padding on corners when up.  I'm waiting for the day when\nI bash my head on the corner.\nhorn buttons behind air bag in spokes and not in center (personal preference)\nTires fling dirt/mud onto side of car \n\nMy Likes:\nengine (design/valves/sounds/smoothness/power/mileage/torque) -- definitely #1\nhandling (very good for FWD; understeer only at limits)\ntransmission (the 5 speed is a must)\nusable instrumentation (lovely readable analog everywhere)\nVery little torque steer at full power (much better than the '90 SHO I drive)\nstability at 100+mph (high gearing though)\nlow cowl (good visibility in front)\nHeated outside mirrors (nice in fog, never tested in freezing weather)\nABS/Air bag (see above)\nrear seats fold down (I have few rear seat passengers so a trunk not important)\nNo shake/rattle noises when going over bumps/potholes (still!)\nTires: 225/55VR16 Goodyear Eagles (70% left; hoping for 30K :-)\n\nAs you can see, I'm primarily interested in the engine.  While it doesn't\nhave the uummmph of a big-liter car or the turbo rush, the big selling\npoint for me was the all-aluminum 24 value 2.5 liter engine.  \n\nThe overall car is a good buy for the money.  That market segment hasn't changed\nmuch since July (Prelude VTEC, Honda Del Sol??).  I drive it to and from work\neach day on relatively smooth roads, and most noticable thing is that the\nProbe's suspension doesn't like potholes.  When you test drive one, find a \npotholed road somewhere around town and see if the jarring you get is tolerable.\nIf you have 3+ passengers, by all means bring them along too.  They'll find\nthat they have no room in the back and you'll find that the car rides\ndifferently (if that's \"better\" is up to you).  Also, there's a lot of glass\naround you which I wasn't expecting; the temperature inside the car gets pretty\nhot in the summer.  My back seat passengers (now very few) complain about\nthe lack of ventilation; you may want to consider that when combined with\nthe heat.  I've heard that the exhaust system has trouble, but mine works fine.\nLeather and the keyless entry system weren't available when I got the car so\nI can't comment on them (I got the car before it was officially announced).  \nI prefer cloth to leather anyway.  \n\nI wouldn't want this car in the snow:  The suspension is too rough for the\ninevitable surprise potholes, tires aren't meant for snow, and the seats assume\nthat you're not wearing lots of thick clothing.  Rain is much better:  water \ngenerally beads off the windshield at freeway speed, the windshield wiper\ncontrols are easy and understandable, and I barely hydroplaned once with the\nEagles (and I was really trying).  \nThere is also a definite lack of cup holder/small storage places.  The GT\nhas map holders below the speakers in the door, but they're rigid plastic\nthat could fit two cassettes or CD's max.  The center console/storage bin/arm\nrest has *1* cup holder and the back of the front seats have a cloth \"pouch\"\nbut that's it.  No change holders.  Quite a let-down from the SHO.\nAnd the Probe is definitely not a people-mover car or an econo-box car!\n\nLastly, don't store wet car covers in the back.  The foam will soak the \nwater up and the result will *not* smell pleasant :-(.\n\nNathan\nnathan@sco.com\n\n\n"},{"role":"assistant","content":"rec.autos"}]}

A person from Jesus' culture authorized\nto conduct business \"in John's name\" had full authority over John's\nfinancial affairs, but was held under a solemn fiduciary obligation to\nwork only for John's benefit and consonant with John's wishes.  It was\nnot required for the steward to preface each business transaction with\n\"in John's name\"; it was sufficient to have valid power of attorney\nand be operating in good faith. (Note the overlap here between legal\nand religious definitions of \"faith\".)\n\nWith this cultural background, praying \"in Jesus' name\" does not\nmandate a particular verbal formula; rather it requires that the\npetitioner be operating faithfully and consciously within an analogous\n\"fiduciary\" relationship with Jesus and for the purposes of His\nKingdom.  The message of \"praying in Jesus' name\" is thus closely\naligned with the parable of the talents and other passages about God's\ndelegation of Kingdom business to his stewards, both resources and\nresponsibilities.  This idea of praying \"in Jesus' name\" is not only\npresent but prominent in the Lord's Prayer, although the verbal\nforumula is absent.\n\nThe act of praying the words \"In Jesus' Name\" may be beneficial if\nthey cause us to clarify the relationship of our requests to the\nadvancement of God's Kingdom.  For that reason, I'm not quite ready\nto say that the praying the formula is without meaning.\n\nPrayers to God for other purposes (desperation, anger, thanksgiving,\netc.) don't seem to be in this category at all, whether uttered by\nChristian or non-Christian, whether B.C. or A.D. (that's B.C.E. or\nC.E. for you P.C. :-).

I've been reflecting on what certain words meant in my \nchildhood and tracing how this shaped some of my attitudes. \n\nI grew up in a home where Christ was a bad word.  People who were very \nangry said it.  The word Christian meant someone who was not a Jew.  It \ncarried connotations of otherness, of threat, of enemy.  It took some \ntime to figure out that there was a connection between `Christ' and \n`Christian'.  When I accepted Jesus, I expected to be disowned.  To \nbecome a Christian meant to join the enemy.  I knew others would \nconsider me a traitor.  At some level, I agreed, but was still prepared \nto pay this price.  Like Esau, I sold my birthright.  However, I made a \nbetter bargain.  He only got some stew, but I got the incomparable \nriches of knowing Christ.\n\nAs it turned out, my parents did not disown me.  I found out later that \nthey were hoping it was a phase that I would grow out of.  By the time \nthey had decided it wasn't a phase, they were sort of used to it.  They \ndidn't disown me but they didn't completely accept the situation either.  \nFor example, they didn't come to my wedding because it was in a church.   \nWhen I visited my grandmother in the hospital a few days before her \ndeath, she said to me, \"As far as I'm concerned, you still are a Jew.\" \nWhat she meant was that she loved me and forgave me.  But I am not a \nJew.  I am a Christian.  (I'll concede, one that likes chicken soup with \nmatzoh balls.:-)) \n\nI do not keep kosher.  I do not celebrate the Sabbath on Saturday.  My \nsons are not circumcised.  But these things are true of some people who \ndo consider themselves Jews.  It is not these rules that make people \nJews; it is the heritage from the past.  I gave up the past.\n\nThis is why I find it hard to relate to Messianic Jews.  Their \nexperience is unlike mine.  They still consider themselves Jews while \nfollowing Jesus.  Some would even say that I *must* do so, too.  \n\nI am at a stage of my life now where I would like to have a heritage.  \nIt was not something I valued very much when I gave it.  But I did have \na sense that I was giving it for God.  It may have been a small \nsacrifice.  It may have been an unnecessary sacrifice.  But I gave it \nand do not want to ask for it back.\n\nAnd while I don't have the heritage I was born with, I do have another.  \nI am an outcast from the house of Israel, but I am a member of the \nChurch.  One of the things I like about being a Catholic Christian is \nthat it is rich in tradition.  It gives me a feeling of, once again, \nbeing rooted in the past. \n\nThis is probably one of the reasons why I don't like it when people mess \naround with Christian traditions (for example, changing the name of \nEaster).  These traditions fill an important emotional need of mine.\n\nI suppose the point of all this is that people shouldn't assume that all \nbelievers of Jewish background are the same.  For some `Jewish \nChristian' is a good name, for others it is an oxymoron. "},{"role":"assistant","content":"soc.religion.christian"}]}

I argued this thoroughly about 3-4 weeks ago.  Men and women are\ndifferent ... physically, physiologically, and psychologically.  Much\nrecent evidence for this statement is present in the book \"Brainsex\" by\nAnne Moir and David Jessel.  I recommend you find a copy and read it.\nTheir book is an overview of recent scientific research on this topic\nand is well referenced. \n\nNow, if women and men are different in some ways, the law can only\nadequately take into account their needs in these areas where they are\ndifferent by also taking into account the ways in which men and women\nare different.  Maternity leave is an example of this -- it takes into\naccount that women get pregnant.  It does not give women the same rules\nit would give to men, because to treat women like it treats men in this\ninstance would be unjust.  This is just simply an obvious example of\nwhere men and women are intrinsically different!!!!!\n\nNow, people make the _naive_ argument that sexism = oppression.\nHowever, maternity leave is sexist because MEN DO NOT GET PREGNANT. \nMen do not have the same access to leave that women do (not to the same\nextent or degree), and therefore IT IS SEXIST.  No matter however much a\nman _wants_ to get pregnant and have maternity leave, HE NEVER CAN.  And\ntherefore the law IS SEXIST.  No man can have access to maternity leave,\nNO MATTER HOW HARD HE TRIES TO GET PREGNANT.  I hope this is clear.\n\nMaternity leave is an example where a sexist law is just, because the\nsexism here just reflects the \"sexism\" of nature in making men and women\ndifferent.  There are many other differences between men and women which\nare far more subtle than pregnancy, and to find out more of these I\nrecommend you have a look at the book \"Brainsex\".\n\nYour point that perhaps some day men can also be pregnant is fallacious.\nIf men can one day become pregnant it will be by having biologically\nbecome women!  To have a womb and the other factors required for\npregnancy is usually wrapped up in the definition of what a woman is --\nso your argument, when it is examined, is seen to be fallacious.  You\nare saying that men can have the sexist maternity leave privilege that \nwomen can have if they also become women -- which actually just supports\nmy statement that maternity leave is sexist.\n\n\nThere is no official priesthood in Islam -- much of this function is\ntaken by Islamic scholars.  There are female Islamic scholars and\nfemale Islamic scholars have always existed in Islam.  An example from\nearly Islamic history is the Prophet's widow, Aisha, who was recognized\nin her time and is recognized in our time as an Islamic scholar.\n\n\nYou have no evidence for your blanket statement about all religions, and\nI dispute it.  I could go on and on about women in Islam, etc., but I\nrecently reposted something here under the heading \"Islam and Women\" --\nif it is still at your news-site I suggest you read it.  It is reposted\nfrom soc.religion.islam, so if it has disappeared from alt.atheism it\nstill might be in soc.religion.islam (I forgot what its original title\nwas though).  I will email it to you if you like. \n\n\nYour statement that \"other religions are no different\" is, I think, a\nstatement based simply on lack of knowledge about religions other than\nChristianity and perhaps Judaism.\n\n\nAisha, who I mentioned earlier, was not only an Islamic scholar but also\nwas, at one stage, a military leader.\n\n\nThe Prophet's first wife, who died just before the \"Hijra\" (the\nProphet's journey from Mecca to Medina) was a successful businesswoman.\n\nLucio, you cannot make a strong case for your viewpoint when your\nviewpoint is based on ignorance about world religions."},{"role":"assistant","content":"alt.atheism"}]}

They could save far more lives by\nfighting against Third World debt than they will by fighting against\nabortion.  Hell, if they're only interested in fetuses, they could save more\nof those by fighting for human rights in China.\n\nAnd besides, Suzanne's answer implies that non-Western countries lack this\nethic against infanticide.  Apart from China, with its policy of mandatory\nforced abortion in Tibet, I don't believe this to be the case.\n"},{"role":"assistant","content":"talk.religion.misc"}]}

The first part of the plan is to begin a \ncomprehensive inquiry into major communications privacy issues \nsuch as export controls which have effectively denied most people \neasy access to robust encryption as well as law enforcement issues \nposed by new technology.\n\n       However, EFF is very concerned that the Administration has \nalready reached a conclusion on one critical part of the inquiry, before \nany public comment or discussion has been allowed.  Apparently, the \nAdministration is going to use its leverage to get all telephone \nequipment vendors to adopt a voice encryption standard developed \nby the National Security Agency. The so-called \"Clipper Chip\" is an \n80-bit, split key escrowed encryption scheme which will be built into \nchips manufactured by a military contractor.  Two separate escrow \nagents would store users' keys, and be required to turn them over \nlaw enforcement upon presentation of a valid warrant.  The \nencryption scheme used is to be classified, but they chips will be \navailable to any manufacturer for incorporation into their \ncommunications products.\n\n       This proposal raises a number of serious concerns .\n\n       First, the Administration appears to be adopting a solution \nbefore conducting an inquiry.  The NSA-developed Clipper chip may \nnot be the most secure product. Other vendors or developers may \nhave better schemes. Furthermore, we should not rely on the \ngovernment as the sole source for Clipper or any other chips.  Rather,\nindependent chip manufacturers should be able to produce chipsets \nbased on open standards.\n\n       Second, an algorithm can not be trusted unless it can be tested. \nYet the Administration proposes to keep the chip algorithm \nclassified.  EFF believes that any standard adopted ought to be public \nand open.  The public will only have confidence in the security of a \nstandard that is open to independent, expert scrutiny.  \n\n       Third, while the use of the split-key, dual-escrowed \nsystem may prove to be a reasonable balance between privacy and \nlaw enforcement needs, the details of this scheme must be explored \npublicly before it is adopted.  What will give people confidence in the \nsafety of their keys?  Does disclosure of keys to a third party waive \nindividual's fifth amendment rights in subsequent criminal \ninquiries?  \n\n       In sum, the Administration has shown great sensitivity to the \nimportance of these issues by planning a comprehensive inquiry into \ndigital privacy and security.  However, the \"Clipper chip\" solution \nought to be considered as part of the inquiry, not be adopted before \nthe discussion even begins.\n\nDETAILS OF THE PROPOSAL:\n\nESCROW\n\nThe 80-bit key will be divided between two escrow agents, each of \nwhom hold 40 bits of each key.  Upon presentation of a valid \nwarrant, the two escrow agents would have to turn the key parts \nover to law enforcement agents.  Most likely the Attorney General \nwill be asked to identify appropriate escrow agents.  Some in the \nAdministration have suggested one non-law enforcement federal \nagency, perhaps the Federal Reserve, and one non-governmental \norganization.  But, there is no agreement on the identity of the agents \nyet.\n\nKey registration would be done by the manufacturer of the \ncommunications device.  A key is tied to the device, not to the person \nusing it.\n\nCLASSIFIED ALGORITHM AND THE POSSIBILITY OF BACK DOORS\n\nThe Administration claims that there are no back door means by \nwhich the government or others could break the code without \nsecuring keys from the escrow agents and that the President will \nbe told there are no back doors to this classified algorithm.  In order \nto prove this, Administration sources are interested in arranging for \nan all-star crypto cracker team to come in, under a security \narrangement, and examine the algorithm for trap doors.  The results \nof the investigation would then be made public.\n\nGOVERNMENT AS MARKET DRIVER\n\nIn order to get a market moving, and to show that the government \nbelieves in the security of this system, the feds will be the first big \ncustomers for this product.  Users will include the FBI, Secret Service, \nVP Al Gore, and maybe even the President. \n\nFROM MORE INFORMATION CONTACT:\n\nJerry Berman, Executive Director\nDaniel J.

Otherwise we would have the book\nof Enoch in the canon (as Dave noted).  One can say that the \napocrypha are not quoted by Christ.  \n\n\nIII. The deuterocanonicals are not in the canon because\n \t\tthey teach doctrines contrary to the (uncontroverted)\n \t\tparts of the canon.\n \n \tthen I answer: \n \t\tThese is a logically invalid *a priori*. \n \t\tBesides, we are talking about OT texts- \n \t\twhich in many parts are superceded by the NT\n \t\t(in the Xtian view). Would not this same\n \t\tprinciple exclude _Ecclesiastes_?\n \t\tThis principle cannot be consistently applied.\n \nI have to reject your argument here.  The Spirit speaks with one\nvoice, and he does not contradict himself.  \n\nThe ultimate test of canonicity is whether the words are inspired\nby the Spirit, i.e., God-breathed.  It is a test which is more\nguided by faith than by reason or logic.  The early church decided\nthat the Apocrypha did not meet this test--even though some books\nsuch as The Wisdom of Ben Sirach have their uses.  For example,\nthe Lutheran hymn \"Now Thank We All Our God\" quotes a passage\nfrom this book.\n\nThe deutero-canonical books were added much later in the church's\nhistory.  They do not have the same spiritual quality as the\nrest of Scripture.  I do not believe the church that added these\nbooks was guided by the Spirit in so doing.  And that is where\nthis sort of discussion ultimately ends."},{"role":"assistant","content":"soc.religion.christian"}]}

{"messages":[{"role":"system","content":"You are a helpful assistant who can classify newsletters into the right categories."},{"role":"user","content":"As promised, I spoke today with the company mentioned in a Washington\nTimes article about the Clipper chip announcement. The name of the company\nis Secure Communicatiions Technology (Information will be given at the end\nof this message on how to contact them).\n\n   Basically they are disturbed about the announcement for many reasons that\nwe are. More specifically however, Mr. Bryen of Secure Communications\nbrought to light many points that might interest most of the readers.\n\n   His belief is that AT&T was made known of the clipper well before the\nrest of the industry. This is for several reasons, several of which are:\n\n - A company of AT&T's size could never be able to make a decision to use\n   the new chip on the SAME DAY it was announced.\n\n - Months ago they proposed using their own chip for AT&T's secure telephone\n   devices. AT&T basically blew them off as being not interested at all.\n   This stuck them as strange, until now...\n\n\n   Also I spoke with Art Melnick, their cryptographer, he expressed several\nconcerns over the new Clipper Chip:\n\n  - The obvious backdoor will be able to let many people decrypt the code.\n\n  - Once the key is released to authorities the security of the crypto\n    system is lost forever. These keys can end up in the hands of any agency\n    of the government.\n\n  - The fact that the escrowed keys never change means that the algorithm\n    is vulnerable over time to an attacker.\n\n  - The classified algorithm may hide another backdoor. But he feels that\n    it is probably to keep people from forging fake serial numbers, or\n    changing the keys themselves.\n\n  - Additionally he feels that the NSA has probably spent enough time and\n    money in working on a way to keep this chip from being reversed\n    engineered, that he feels that reverse engineering it will be very\n    difficult to do. He feels that they have developed a suitable technique\n    to protect the chip from this attack. Also he feels that the chip is\n    hardware encoded with the algorithm and not microcoded onto the chip.\n\nAdditonally I spoke with Mr. Melnick about their algorithm. He couldn't tell\nme much about their new agorithm because it hasn't been patented yet.\nHowever he told me a little:\n\n - The algorithm will be released for public review after patents have been\n   granted for it. This is so the crypto community can see that it is\n   secure.\n\n - The algorithm is called NEA for New Encryption Algorithm.\n   The details were sketchy because now it is held as a trade secret\n   until the patent was issued, but I was told that it will incorporate\n   the following:\n\n    - It will have fast encryption of data (Exact specs not given, but\n      Mr. Melnick stated \"Much faster than what an RS-232 can put out.\")\n\n    - It is a symmetric cipher, just like IDEA and DES.\n\n    - It will use 64 bit data blocks for encryption (like DES and IDEA).\n\n    - The key length was not given to me, but Mr. Melnick states that\n      it is _adujustable_ and is \"More than adequate for security.\"\n\n    - The algorithm is written in C and Assembler in software form, and\n      can be ported to many platforms (Unlike the the Clipper Chip which\n      is hardware ONLY and cannot be made into software) This I\n      consider a definite plus for the NEA for widespread use.\n\n    - The algorithm will accomodate public key distribution techniques\n      such as RSA or Diffie-Hellman. This will also be supported in the\n      hardware chip.\n\n    - Right now the projected cost of the NEA chip will be about 10 dollars\n      for each!! (Clipper will run 25 each chip [that is if it is produced\n      enough, which probably won't happen]).\n\n    - They currently sell a program called C-COM that uses the algorithm\n      and a special streaming protocol that does not divide the encrypted\n      data into \"blocks.\" This could prevent plaintext attacks if you know\n      what the block header is. This program operates at all supported\n      RS-232 speeds and uses the software implementation of the algorithm.\n\n    - Most importantly: IT DOES NOT HAVE A BACKDOOR!!\n\n\n\nRight now the company is afraid that the new clipper chip will put them out\nof business. This is a very real possibility. So they really need help in\nstopping the clipper chip from becoming a standard. If you want to contact\nthem, they can be reached at..\n\nSecure Communications Technology\n8700 Georgia Ave. Suite 302\nSilver Spring, MD\n\n(301) 588-2200\n\nI talked to Mr. Bryen who represents the company. He can answer any\nquestions you have.\n\n\n\n\nAny factual errors occurring in this write up are my own and I apologize for\nthem ahead of time.\n\n "},{"role":"assistant","content":"sci.crypt"}]}

but I labored even more than all of them, yet not I,\n   but the grace of God with me.\n\n11 Whether then it was I or they, so we preach and so you believed.\n\n12 Now if Christ is preached, that He has been raised from the dead,\n   how do some among you say that there is no resurrection of the dead?\n\n13 But if there is no resurrection of the dead, not even Christ has\n   been raised;\n\n14 and if Christ has not been raised, then our preaching is vain, your\n   faith also is vain.\n\n15 Moreover we are even found to be false witnesses of God, because we\n   witnessed against God that He raised Christ, whom He did not raise,\n   if in fact the dead are not raised.\n\n16 For if the dead are not raised, not even Christ has been raised;\n\n17 and if Christ has not been raised, your faith is worthless; you are\n   still in your sins.\n\n18 Then those also who have fallen asleep in Christ have perished.\n\n19 If we have hoped in Christ in this life only, we are of all men most\n   to be pitied.\n\n20 BUT NOW CHRIST HAS BEEN RAISED FROM THE DEAD, the first fruits of\n   those who are asleep.\n\n21 For since by a man came death, by a man also came the resurrection\n   of the dead.\n\n22 For as in Adam all die, so also in Christ all shall be made alive.\n\n23 But each in his own order: Christ the first fruits, after that those\n   who are Christ's at His coming,\n\n24 then comes the end, when He delivers up the kingdom to the God and\n   Father, when He has abolished all rule and all authority and power.\n\n25 For He must reign until He has put all His enemies under His feet.\n\n26 The last enemy that will be abolished is death.\n\n\n             LOGICAL PROOFS OF JESUS CHRIST'S RESURRECTION\n\n            1.  Jesus's enemies *would not* have stolen His\n                body because that would have perpetrated the\n                resurrection--the very opposite of what they\n                desired.\n\n            2.  Jesus' disciples *could not* have stolen His\n                body because Pontius Pilate established guards\n                to stand watch over the tomb lest His body be\n                stolen.\n\n            3.  Sadly (and ironically), many of Jesus' disciples\n                did not believe in the Resurrection until Jesus\n                had risen from the dead.\n\n            4.  In nearly 20 centuries, no body has ever been\n                produced to refute Jesus' assertion that He\n                *would indeed* rise from the dead."},{"role":"assistant","content":"soc.religion.christian"}]}

I declined to participate.  Last year at the\nliturgy meeting I pointed out how we crucify Christ by our sins, so\ntherefore it is appropriate that we retain the role of the crowd, but\nto no avail.\n\n\n   As a member of a liturgy committee, I can tell you that the problem\nis certain people dominating, who want to try out all kinds of\ninnovations.  The priests don't seem even to _want_ to make any\ndecisions of their own in many cases.  I guess it's easier to \"try\nsomething new\" than it is to refuse to allow it.\n\n   At our parish on Holy Thursday, instead of the priests washing feet\n(\"Who wants to get around people's feet,\" according to one of our\npriests) the congregation was \"invited\" to come up and help wash one\nanother's hands.\n\n   The symbolism of this action distressed me, and again I refused to\nparticipate.  I thought that if we were to have to come up with\nrubrics for this liturgical action (i.e. \"Body of Christ\" -- \"Amen\"\nfor receiving Communion), that they could be \"I am not responsible for\nthe blood of this man.\"\n\n   Also for part of the Eucharistic Prayer (\"Blessed are You, God of\nall creation...\") was substituted some text read by a lay couple.

Both are \nnoted for their galvanizing oratorical skills, which they both used with \npassion to generate a political cult of massive numerical proportions (in \nfact, Limbaugh claims to have an audience of just over 12 million, almost \nidentical to the number of votes cast for Hitler in the April 1932 German \nelection). Both used a myopic social perspective to build the cult, and \nenthusiastically amputated facts from the record to fabricate their \nideological quilt.\n\tThe last point is glaringly documented by passages in the opening \npages of both books. Hitler's example is when, on page 5, he claims the \nGerman nationalist terrorist Leo Schlageter (he bombed part of a railway \nline between Dusseldorf and Duisburg, being caught in the act, in 1923) \nwas \"betrayed to France by a representative of his government\" when \nthere has never been any factual foundation for such a statement.\n\tIn fact, the governments of both the Reich and Prussia, as well as \nthe Vatican, actively intervened to save him from execution, and almost \nsucceeded. Limbaugh follows suit by making the hysterically sarcastic \nclaim in his introduction that \"in a school or during a commencement \nceremony or many other public places... God is unconstitutional.\" Of \ncourse, it's not God but the official imposition of particular concepts of \nGod against an individual's will that's unconstitutional. But Limbaugh is \ntoo gleeful in his talent for distortion to want you to know that.\n\tOf course, one would assume that, by comparing the two books, \nmy main point would be that The Way Things Ought to Be is the modern \nAmerican Mein Kampf. Not really. At the time of the first German version \nof Mein Kampf, Hitler was just four months out of prison (June, 1925), \nand trying to reorganize the Nazis. He used the book to build his dozen \nmillion followers. Limbaugh, on the other hand, came up with his book \nafter building his dozen million. Twelve million went a longer way in \nWeimar Germany that it does in the Republicrat United States.\n\tThus, the more accurate parallels would be that Limbaugh's daily \nthree-hour radio show is the American Mein Kampf, the primary \npropoganda tool used to pump up the angry volume; and that The Way \nThings Ought to Be is actually the American Triumph of the Will, a \ntranslation of the same fascist message into a different medium. Also, the \nprinted word was the more important medium in Weimar Germany, since \nradio was still being thought of by impoverished Germans as a medium of \nluxury in 1925. Today, on the other hand, Americans are more likely to \nspend a few seconds to tune a radio dial at no monetary charge than drop \n$22 for 304 pages of transcripts of the same words.\n\tBut, as Mort Sahl also observed on the radio the other night, some \ncloutmeister of the radical right wants Limbaugh to be a focal point of \ntheir propoganda. (And remember, Sahl is an Al Haig conservative these \ndays.)\n\tMort might not know exactly who Rush's equivalent of Rodolf \nHess is (the book itself suggests Ed McLaughlin, the former president of \nABC radio and now Limbaugh's partner in EFM Media, the radio \nprogram's production company). But Mort himself is a veteran of the talk \nshow, having hosted them in New York, Washington and Los Angeles. He \nknows what evil lurks in the hearts of major market media men. He knows \nthat Limbaugh could not have collected his audience had not the \nopportunity been placed on a silver platter and handed to him. Limbaugh \nearns his money just as honestly as Al Capone did; it's almost worthy of a \nRICO indictment.\n\tOn questions of social issues, there is an overabundance of \nmaterial in the Limbaugh book that seems to echo Hitler's venom. For \nexample:\n\nOn Their Own Qualifications to Control Society\n\tHitler: \"Out of the host of sometimes millions of people, who \nindividually more or less clearly and distinctly guess the truth, partly \nperhaps understand it, one man [author's emphasis] must step forward in \norder to form, with apodeictic force, out of the wavering world of \nimagination of the great masses, granite principles, and to take up the fight \nfor their sole correctness, until out of the playing waves of a free world of \nthought a brazen rock of uniform combination of form and will arises\" \n(page 577).\n\tLimbaugh: \"Who needs the media when they've got me? ... The \nshow is devoted exclusively to what I think ... [the phrase \"with half my \nbrain tied behind my back to make it even\"] denotes the egress of mental \naptitude I require to engage and demolish liberals and others who disagree \nwith me ... It might take four or five years, but I'm convinced The Media \nwill slowly and reluctantly come around to my way of thinking, kicking \nand screaming all the way.\" (pages 266, 21, 299 and 273, respectively.)\n\nOn Religion as the Basis of a Nation\n\tHitler: \"In this world human culture and civilization are \ninseperably bound up with the existence of the Aryan. His dying-off or his \ndecline would again lower upon this earth the dark veils of a time without \nculture ... He who dares to lay hand upon the highest image of the Lord \nsins against the benevolent Creator of this miracle and helps in the \nexpulsion from Paradise.\" (Page 581.)\n\tLimbaugh: \"America was founded as a Judeo-Christian country ... \nBut our intellectual and political elites are often either hostile or \nambivalent toward religion ... People for whom belief in God is at best a \ncharming superstition have managed to ban prayer from the public schools \nfor the last thirty years. Is it only a coincidence that the quality of \nAmerican education has declined ever since?\" (pages 274-5.)\n\nOn Popular Culture as a Reason for Social Collapse\n\tHitler: \"The fight against the poisoning of the soul has to set in ... \nOne has only to look at the menus of our movie houses, vaudevilles and \ntheatres; and one can hardly deny that this is not the right kind of food ... \nTheatre, art, literature, movies, the press, billposters and window displays \nmust be cleaned of the symptoms of a rotting world and put into the \nservice of a moral idea of State and culture.\" (pages 346 and 348.)\n\tLimbaugh: \"Today, Hollywood is in trouble. The reason [is] that \nHollywood has forgotten who its audience is ... They make fun of people \nwho believe in God. They ridicule the traditional family, heterosexuality \nand monagamy. They disparage American heroes.\" (page 254.)\n\nOn the News Meida\n\tHitler: \"The activity of the so-called liberal press was the work of \ngravediggers for the German people and the German Reich. One can pass \nby in silence the Marxist papers of lies ... it's task is only to break the \npeople's folkish and national spine, in order to make it ripe for the yoke of \nslavery of international capital and its masters, the Jews.\" (Page 331.)\n\tLimbaugh: \"Elements of The Media have jumped on the \nbandwagon of leftist causes. The cynical journalist of the past has been \nreplaced in many cases by an enthusiastic cheerleader for causes ... During \nthe Gulf war, CNN correspondent Bernard Shaw [said] CNN is a global \nnetwork. We can't take sides. Cant take sides? --- --- ---! ... If they don't \nrealize that their freedom lies in the United States of America and that \ntherefore they should defend this nation, they are hopelessly misguided \nand, may I suggest, flirting with megalomania.\" (pages 270 and 268.)\n\n*     *     *\n\t\nTo continue these comparative excerpts is certainly possible, but \nultimately too depressing to take in one reading.\n\tAfter putting these books down, there is one undeniable fact that \nhaunts me. In the 1920s, Adolf Hitler fed depressed and frightened \nGermans the opiate of hatred of those around them; in turn, it allowed \nGermans to hand their collective national power to the Nazis. In the 1990s, \nRush Limbaugh is doing the very same thing: distributing hatred to \ndepressed and frightened Americans; in turn, it is helping the American \nradical right to maintain its power base as the 12-year nightmare of the \nReagan-Bush era comes to an end, hoping to rebuild it into their hopes for \nThe Fascist States of America.\n\tAnd if Limbaugh is not as repellant a Hitler, it is only because the \nradical right utilizes Limbaugh as its own gateway opiate. One can only \nwonder what the ultimate drug is they plan to hook America on.\n\nThe Madison Edge can be reached at PO Box 845, Madison, WI 53701-\n0845; (608) 255-4460."},{"role":"assistant","content":"talk.politics.misc"}]}

Depends on WHY it misfired....\n\n\nI can't imagine doing much combat type shooting single action.....\n\n\nAssuming the cylinder WILL rotate....\n\n\nNever hurts to err on the side of safety, but if you've got one of those\n'new fangled' hammer blocks or transfer bar safeties, it's unnecessarily\nredundant.  I'd rather have the extra round.\n\n\nQuite true.  Speed loaders are a little less convenient to pack around\nthan magazines though.\n\n\nTrue, but this is a training function.\n\n\nCocked and locked for single actions or hammer down on double actions\nare the only carry modes that make sense...  The 80 series Colt's for\nexample are quite safe to carry this way.\n\n\nAgreed.\n\nNow that I've shot off my mouth a bit, let me back some of this up.  It\nis true that a simple misfire on a revolver doesn't cost you much.  On\nthe other hand, I've had all sorts of interesting things happen over the\nyears.  For example, I've had FACTORY ammunition that has had high\nprimers.  A high primer will tie your revolver up somewhere from seconds\nto minutes while you try to pound the action open to clear the problem.\nAn auto?  Jack the slide and continue.\n\nI've had bullets come out of the case, keeping the cylinder from\nturning, see clearing paragraph above.  About the WORST that can happen\nwith a semi auto is a double feed.  This can be cleared in seconds.\n\nMost revolvers are more 'fragile' then semi auto's.  There are all sorts\nof close tolerance parts and fitting involved.  Dropping the gun, or a\nblow to the gun or all sorts of things can take it out of action.  Many\nof the problems that can be cured on the spot with a (quality) semi auto\ntake a gun smith for a revolver.  In short a revolver MAY be less likely\nto malfunction, but as a rule when it does, you're out of the fight.\nThe majority of malfunctions that occur with semi autos does not fall\ninto that category.\n\nVincint makes many good points in this post, but leaves off the opposing\nview of most of them.  A real good starting place is Ayoob's \"The Semi\nAuto Pistol for Police and Self Defense.\"\n\nIn general, I'd agree, the revolver is an excellent first gun and self\ndefense weapon for somebody that does not have the time, and inclination\nthat is necessary for the training and practice needed to use a semi\nauto effectively as a self defense arm.\n\nMost cops are notoriously indifferent to firearms.  If the department\nisn't going to train them, they aren't going to take the time on their\nown.  There is no doubt that training is an issue.  The amount of\ntraining required for effective use of a semi auto is probably several\ntimes that of a revolver.  Many cops don't bother.\n\nFor myself, I'd hate to be limited to one or the other.  I'd rather pick\nwhat fits better with my personal inclination, what I'm wearing that day\nand so on.  Like the Moderator on rec.guns says, buy em all!\n\nThat said, I have to admit that often my advice to people thinking of\nbuying their first defense arm is (right after taking a class) get a\nRuger or Smith revolver....  (Sorry Colt fans.  Colt revolvers are ok\ntoo!)\n\nIf this post had gone the other way, I'd be arguing for revolvers. :-)"},{"role":"assistant","content":"talk.politics.guns"}]}

Dr. Teperman \ntrained in Pittsburgh under Dr. Starzl and is now the Assistant \nDirector of the Liver Transplant Program at New York University \nMedical Center.  Dr. Teperman will discuss current trends in \ntransplantation and treatment and will answer questions.  He is \na long time friend of TRIO, surgeon to many of our members, and \nalways a gracious and delightful guest.   It is sure to be a \nvery informative, interesting and engaging evening.  Our \nhospitality committee,  Bette and Vito Suglia and Jim Spence \nwill be well prepared, and at last the weather should be \ncooperative. We hope to see a very large gathering to welcome \nDr. Teperman. \n\n          WEDNESDAY    APRIL 14  K of C   UNIONDALE\n\n\nLAST MEETING\n\nIt has been noted here before that the Long Island Chapter of \nTRIO has extraordinary power in predicting bad weather, being \nable to forecast rain, sleet and snow fully a month in advance.  \nNo TV weatherman can match us. This time we not only scored \nagain, but we were also able to disable the Long Island \nRailroad, making travel REALLY difficult.  None the less, many \nbraved the snow and we had an interesting meeting and good \nconversation.  Our scheduled speaker, Mrs. Elizabeth Linnehan, \na professional nutritionist, had a family emergency and was not \nable to attend.  She hope she will be with us in the fall to \ndiscuss diet and medications.  However,  Ms. Jennifer Friedman, \nan image consultant and sister of a liver transplant recipient \nwas kind enough to step in on very short notice.  Ms. Friedman \ngave us a lot of good advice about choosing clothes and makeup, \n(even a bit for men) to help us look well and healthy and to \nminimize some of the cosmetic effects of some of the medicine \nand drugs we take.  We are most grateful to Jennifer and thank \nher for an entertaining evening.\n\n\n\nANNUAL MEETING\n\nIn addition to welcoming Dr. Teperman, the April meeting is \nalso the Annual meeting of the Chapter.  This is the official \nnotice of the meeting as required by our By-Laws. The main \npurpose of the meeting is to review the past year, solicit \nmember views and ideas for better ways to meet their needs, and \nto elect members of the Board of Directors for the coming two \nyear term.  The nominating committee has prepared the following \nslate for the Board.\n\n         Anne (Liver Recipient) and Don Treffeisen\n         Robert (Heart Recipient) and Eulene Smith\n         Vito (Kidney Recipient) and Bette Suglia\n         Kay Grenzig (Liver Recipient)\n         Jan Schichtel (Kidney Recipient)\n         Larry Juliano (Kidney Recipient)\n         David Bekofsky (Director Public Education LITP)\n\nThose remaining on the Board for another year are:\n\n         Robert Carroll (Liver, Kidney & Pancreas Recipient)\n         Jerry (Kidney Recipient) and Jeanne Eichhorn\n         Ron (Kidney Donor) and Marie Healy\n         Peter Smith (Bone Marrow Recipient)\n         Patricia Ann Yankus (Kidney and Pancreas Recipient)\n         Walter Ruzak (Kidney Recipient)\n\nThis may seem to be a big Board, but many hands make light work \nand with our various medical uncertainties, it is good to have \nbackups for all the jobs on the Board.  Therefore, in addition \nto the slate being presented for voting, nominations will also \nbe accepted from the floor.  There is no set number of Board \nmembers and there is plenty of work. \n\nIn addition,  brief treasurer's and membership reports will be \ngiven and the floor will be open for any new business, \nsuggestions, or comments anyone would like to bring up.\n\nWe will keep the formal meeting short so that we can spend the \nmajority of the time with Dr. Teperman.\n\nFUTURE MEETINGS\n\nRemember the scheduled guests for the rest of the year.  \n\n     May  12      Dr. Peter Shaprio, Chief of Psychiatry\n                  Columbia Presbyterian Medical Center\n\n     June  9      Dr. Felix Rappaport, Director of the Stony \n                  Brook Kidney Transplant Program. \n\nPlan on being with us the second Wednesday of each month.\n\nNOTDAW\n\nThe week of April 18-24 is National Organ and Tissue Donor \nAwareness Week. NOTDAW. While we are planning news releases, \nspeaking engagements and meetings with Supervisors Gullata and \nGaffney, we have decided not to have our softball game   \nbecause of two year's experience with miserable weather. \n\nWe all can help spread the word on donor awareness, however. We \nhave found it effective to ask your pastor, or rabbi to publish \na letter or announcement in the parish bulletin, allow you to \naddress the congregation, or include mention of the gift of \nlife in his sermon.  Attached to this Newsletter is a sample \nletter and fact sheet you can use.   Thank you.\n\nDR. STARZL TO BE HONORED \n\nThe Long Island Chapter of the American Liver Foundation will \nhold its annual Auction and Dinner Dance on May 7th at the \nFountainbleu  on Jericho Turnpike in Jericho.  Dr. Thomas \nStarzl will be the honored guest.  Tickets are $50 person and \nare going fast.  If you'd like to meet Dr. Starzl,  call Anne \nTreffeisen at (516) 421-3258 for details.\n\nMEMBERSHIP NEWS \n\nCongratulations to Al Reese.  Al received his heart transplant \nin Pittsburgh after waiting 3 1/2 years.  He is home and doing \nwell after only 12 days in hospital.\n\nArthur Michaels, liver recipient, is planning to run the Boston \nMarathon in April. What fantastic proof that transplantation \nworks!  We hope the national press notices. \n     \nBob McCormack, after a persistent bout with infection, had his \ntransplanted kidney removed.  He is home now, back on dialysis \nand feeling better.  \n\nNicole Healy, kidney recipient and daughter of Ron and Marie, \nspent the past several weeks in hospital in Miami with problems \nencountered on vacation.  Marie has been with her in Florida.  \nThey are back in New York where Nicole's treatment will \ncontinue.  We wish Nicole a speedy recovery. \n\nKay Grenzig, liver recipient, is mending now after a bad fall \nthat resulted in a broken arm and a broken leg. Kay is a \ncandidate for the Board so we need her well soon.\n \nAnd best wishes to all coming out of the flu.

The messiah comes to build the kingdom of heaven\non the earth.  He also comes to first reveal the root cause of\noriginal sin (fallen nature) and then provide a means to cut the\nconnection to that original sin.  He also wants to create world peace\nbased on Godism.  The messiah's teachings will build on the foundation\nof the Bible but provide profound new insights into the nature of God,\nthe fall of man, the purpose of creation, and God's providence of\nrestoration.  It will also provide a foundation for the unity of all\nthe World's religions.\n\nMany Christians expect Jesus to come on literal clouds, so they may\nmiss him when he returns. Just as the Jewish people missed Jesus 2000\nyears ago.  They are still waiting for his first coming.  The Jewish\npeople of that age expected Elijah to come first.  Jesus said that\nJohn the Baptist was Elijah. But John the Baptist denied that he was\nElijah.  (How did this reflect on Jesus?)  Later in prison John even\nquestioned who Jesus was: \"is he the one who is to come or do we look\nfor another\". (see book of Matthew)\n\n\nDavid Koresh didn't even come close.  The problem is that people like\nthis make it difficult for people to believe and trust in the real\nMessiah when he does show up.\n\n\nVery good point and perhaps the most important point of all for\nChristians: How to recognize the Second Coming?\n\nThe Messiah should not claim to be God.  What sets a Messiah apart is\nthat he is born without original sin.  He is not born perfect but\nachieves perfection after a period of growth.

Imake support has been improved, a few defaults have\nbeen changed, and a lot of other small things have been added.\n\nThis is basically a release which drops the 'gamma' status. Next release will\nincorporate some improvements by Stefan Schwarz, and possibly will support\nX11R5 and Motif 1.2.x.\n\nNote to all of those who keep copies of the archive: please retrieve this\ndistribution (during off-peak hours), and delete all previous copies.\n\nHere is the original ANNOUNCEMENT:\n\nHISTORY\n\nThe University of Lowell, supported by a grant of the Open Software Foundation,\nhas developed a wrapper-library, that encapsulates Motif widgets in C++\nclasses. All resources of these Widgets can now be set through\nmember-functions, while objects can be used in callback-functions. The library\nwas made available for free or nominal cost for anonymous ftp at 129.63.1.1.\nHowever, the library contained a large number of bugs and oversights, and only\nworked under X11R3. Due to lack of subsequent fundings, the bindings are no\nlonger actively supported by the University of Lowell.\n\nI, Ronald van Loon, at a certain point last year, have taken the Lowell \nbindings, fixing the bugs I came across, adding missing memberfunctions, and\nenhancing functionality and made the bug-fixed library available for the\ngeneral public for anonymous ftp (made possible by Rick Murphy at DEC).\n\nNEW RELEASE\n\nI am now pleased to announce a new and updated release of the Motif++\nbindings. \n\nThis release offers:\n\n- Full Motif1.1 and X11R4 support\n- Support for Xbae widgetset \n- Two additional widgets, written by myself, that can be used to indicate\n  progress in an application.\n- Imake support. NB: this release relies heavily on the existence of imake\n\t\t     and its config files on your site. I have tried to\n\t\t     provide the bindings with a standard Makefile, tweakable\n\t\t     for those unfortunates without imake. I have not severely\n\t\t     tested the standard Makefile though. Contact me if you\n\t\t     have problems. The reason for calling this a gamma\n\t\t     release lies in the fact that I do not have a multitude\n\t\t     of platforms to test the Imake-files on.\n- Lots of testfiles (even somewhat useful programs)\n- An article I wrote on the usage of Motif, X and C++, previously posted\n  on Usenet.\n\nWHERE TO GET THE NEW MOTIF BINDINGS\n\nFtp:\n\nAnonymous ftp at decuac.dec.com (192.5.214.1), directory /pub/X11.\n\nNote:\n\nPlease be patient as the network link is quite slow. Please do not FTP large\nfiles during working hours.\n\nAlso note that there is also a motif++.31.jan.92.tar.Z file at this site; this\nis an old version of the bindings.\n\nE-mail:\n\nThose who don't have ftp can send me e-mail, and I will send the bindings by\ne-mail.\n\nREQUEST\n\nThose who use the bindings and find bugs, or see room for improvement, please\ncontact me, and I will try to incorporate them in a future release (in case of\nbugs, a bug-fix of course ;-). \n\nMORE INFORMATION \n\nContact me at \"rvloon@cv.ruu.nl\".\nIf you are desperate, then you can call me at\n+31 30 506711 (that is Utrecht, the Netherlands; those within the Netherlands\ncall 030-506711).\n\nEnjoy!\n"},{"role":"assistant","content":"comp.windows.x"}]}

{"messages":[{"role":"system","content":"You are a helpful assistant who can classify newsletters into the right categories."},{"role":"user","content":" \n: [ The discussion begins: why does the universe exist at all?  ]\n \n: One of the Laws of Nature, specifying cause and effect seems to dictate \n: (at least to this layman's mind) there must be a causal event.  No\n: reasonable alternative exists.\n\nI would argue that causality is actually a property of spacetime; \ncauses precede their effects. But if you claim that there must be\nan answer to \"how\" did the universe (our spacetime)  emerge from \n\"nothing\", science has some good candidates for an answer.\n\nI have always wondered why Christians use the \"There are questions\nscience (or atheism) cannot answer\" argument; I hope this is the\nappropriate group to ask this question.\n\nThe most popular question is the question of origins. Why does the\nuniverse exist, or anything, for that matter?\n\nI think this question should actually be split into two parts, namely\n\n1) Why is there existence? Why anything exists?\n\nand\n\n2) How did the universe emerge from nothing?\n\nIt is clear science has nothing to say about the first question. However,\nis it a meaningful question, after all?\n\nI would say it isn't. Consider the following:\n\nA die-hard skeptic being (be it human or whatever) attempts to doubt\none's very existence. Since it is so easy to doubt everything else -\nI cannot be _sure_ the world exists, it may be my mind fooling me -\ncan I ever be sure I exist?\n\nHowever, it is only possible to exist or not to exist. (Someone\ninsert an appropriate Shakespeare quote here ;-) )\n\nA being that does not exist cannot doubt one's existence.\nA being that does exist can doubt one's existence, but this would be\npointless - the being would exist anyway.\n\nLet us return to the original question: why? A being that does not\nexist does not need any reasons for its non-existence. This being\nis not _sure_ whether anything else exists but his mind, but let\nus assume that the world exists independent of the mind (the objectivity\npostulate). The question \"why anything exists\" can be countered by\ndemanding answer to a question \"why there is nothing in nothingness,\nor in non-existence\". Actually, both questions turn out to be\ndevoid of meaning. Things that exist do, and things that don't exist\ndon't exist. Tautology at its best.\n\nI seriously doubt God could have an answer to this question.\n\nSome Christians I have talked to have said that actually, God is\nHimself the existence. However, I see several problems with this\nanswer. First, it inevitably leads to the conclusion that God is\nactually _all_ existence, good and evil, devils and angels, us and\nthem. This is pantheism, not Christianity.\n\nAnother answer is that God is the _source_ of all existence.\nThis sounds much better, but I am tempted to ask: Does God\nHimself exist, then? If God is the source of His own existence,\nit can only mean that He has, in terms of human time, always\nexisted. But this is not the same as the source of all existence.\nThis argument sounds like God does not exist, but meta-exists,\nand from His meta-existent perspective, He created existence.\nI think this is actually a nonsolution, a mere twist of words.\n\nThe best answer I have heard is that human reasoning is incapable\nof understanding such questions. Being an atheist myself, I do not\naccept such answers, since I do not have any other methods.\n\nThe second question: How did the universe emerge from nothing?\nbelongs to the domain of science, and I, for one, do not doubt the\nquestion can be answered by its methods. Many cosmologists have\nsuggested that it is entirely possible for universes to emerge\nfrom vacuum (this possibility has been suggested in a recent\nHawking biography; see also Lizhi & Shuxian: Creation of the Universe,\nWorld Scientific, 1989). However, I think the sci groups are more\nappropriate for discussions like this.\n \n: As far as I can tell, the very laws of nature demand a \"why\".  That isn't\n: true of something outside of nature (i.e., *super*natural).\n\nThis is not true. Science is a collection of models telling us \"how\",\nnot why, something happens. I cannot see any good reason why the \"why\"\nquestions would be bound only to natural things, assuming that the\nsupernatural domain exists. If supernatural beings exist, it is\nas appropriate to ask why they do so as it is to ask why we exist.\n \n: I believe the \"genetic code\" will be entirely deciphered in our lifetimes,\n: but we will not see man convert entirely inert material into self sustaining, \n: reproducing life, *ever*.  (I've never been much of a prophet, though. I\n: can't even *picture* New York in my mind 8^] ).  I don't believe *any*\n: technology would be able to produce that necessary *spark* of life, despite\n: having all of the parts available. Just my opinion.\n\nThis opinion is also called vitalism; namely, that living systems are\nsomehow _fundamentally_ different from inanimate systems. Do Christians\nin general adopt this position? What would happen when scientists announce\nthey have created primitive life (say, small bacteria) in a lab?\n\nThere is a problem with your prophecy: artificial life has been created,\nalthough not yet in a chemical form. Computer simulations of evolution\ncontain systems that are as much alive as any bacterium, although\ntheir code is electronic, as well as their metabolism. See a recent book\n\nSteven Levy: Artificial life - The Quest for a New Creation. Jonathan\nCape, London 1992.\n\nArtificial chemical life is just around the corner - after all, no \nspark of life has been found to be necessary; living systems do not\nviolate any physical laws as we know them. \n\n: You don't mind if a few of us send up a prayer on your behalf during your\n: research, do you?  After all, if we of Christ are deluding ourselves, you\n: really have nothing to worry about, eh?\n\nExactly. This is why I think atheists should _not_ post any evangelical\natheist arguments to soc.religion groups, since people who seek to \nfind peace in religions must be allowed to gather together. I would\nnormally have asked these questions in alt.atheism or talk.religion.misc,\nbut it seems many Christians do not read these groups. \n\nPetri\n"},{"role":"assistant","content":"soc.religion.christian"}]}

So here it comes:\n\nCView has quite a number of bugs.  The one you mention is perhaps the most\nannoying, but not the most dangerous.  As far as I can determine, it has to\ndo with the temp files that CView creates.  CView gives the user no control\nover where it places its temp files: it just places them in its\n\"current directory\".  The problem you mention occurs (as far as I can tell)\nwhen it runs out of disk space for its temp files. It seems as if CView\ndoesn't check properly for this situation.  As Cview decodes a jpeg, it seems \nto write out a temp file with all the pixel data with 24 bit colour\ninformation. Then, for 8 bit displays, it does the \"dithering\", again writing\nanother file with the 8 bit colour information.  While it is writing this\nsecond file, it also writes the data to your colour card. Then when it does\nthe last chunk of 8 bit data, it recopies all the data from the 8 bit file to\nyour screen again.  (It does this last \"recopy\" operation for its\n\"fit to screen\" feature, even when this feature is not enabled.)\n\n The result of this process is the following:\n  \n     1) If it runs out of disk space when writing the first 24 bit file, all\n        you ever see is as much data as it has room for, and the last bit of\n        data is simply repeated over and over again because CView never\n        realizes the disk has filled up and disk writes/reads aren't performed.\n\n     2) If it has enough room for the 24 bit data, but runs out of room for\n        the 8 bit data, you see almost all of the picture as it does the\n        dithering and writes to the screen card.\n        However, then when it finishes the dithering and recopies the data\n        from the 8 bit file to screen (for whatever reason it does this)\n        one again just gets a repetition of the last chunk of data for which\n        there was room on the disk.\n\nThis is just a guess, but probably fairly accurate.  At least the general\nidea is on track I think, although I have probably made errors in details\nabout file I/O etc.  The way around this is  of course to clear up sufficient\ndisk space.  The temp files for large JPEG's (1200x900 and bigger) can be\nvery large (3 Meg + 1 Meg ).  On some of the largest I have needed in excess\nof 6 Meg free disk space.\n\n\nCView has a much more serious bug: if you are trying to display a file from\na floppy, and you change floppies while CView has some temp file open on the\nfloppy, then CView in certain circumstances will write the directory (and FAT\ntable? I can't remember) for the removed floppy onto the newly inserted\nfloppy, thus corruptimg the new floppy in a very serious, possibly\nunrevcoverable way.  SO BE CAREFUL!  It is incredibly poor programming for a\nprogram to do this.  On the other hand, when choosing files in the Open Files\nmenu, CView insists on doing a few disk reads every time one moves the\nhi-lighter square.  Incredibly annoying when it could do them all at once\nwhen it gets the directory info.  And really, how much effort does it take to\nsort a directory listing?\n"},{"role":"assistant","content":"comp.graphics"}]}

The jealousy does not technically exist until the object\nis apparent. However, the capacity to be jealous is presumably still there\neven though it is not detectable.\n\nYour description of the Unbilical took me three passes to understand (!) but\nI get the gist and I have to tentatively agree. I think our two definitions\ncan sit side by side without too much trouble, though. I haven't attempted to\ndefine the reason behind the Moral Driver (only hinted through the essence of\neach Moral). Your definition hints that animals are also capable of a\nsimilar morality - Simians have a similar Social Order to ourselves and it is\neasy to anthropomorphize with these animals. Is this possible or have I\nmisunderstood?\n\n\nMy p.s. thoughts falls roughly in line with John Stuart Mill and\nhis writings on Utilitarianism. I have no particular plan (except to do\nmy bit - personal ethics AND social work). My opinion (for what it is worth)\nis that the Authority for each Moral must be increased somehow, and that this\nwill probably take several generations to be effective. I don't think that the\nlist of Morals has changed for Society significantly, though . The Authority element\nmay come from our authority figures and roles models (see Eric Berne and his\ntransactional analysis work [+ Mavis Klein] for references) and this is what\ngives rise to a deterioration of moral standards in the long term.\n\nI've had some more thoughts on my definitions:\n\nI've was thinking that I should add Moral Character to the list of definitions\nin order to get a dynamic version of the Moral Nature (ie. the interplay of\nthe Moral Code and associated Authorities). A suitable analogy might be a\ngraphic equaliser on a HiFi system - the Moral Nature being the set of\nfrequencies and the chosen 'amplitudes', and the Moral Character being the\nspectrum over time.\n\nConscience is a little more difficult because I can't define it as the\nreasoning of a person between actions in the context of his Moral Nature\nbecause Conscience seems to cut in most of the time unbidden and often\nunwanted. I think Conscience is manifest when a decision is made at a given\ntime which compromises one's Moral Nature. My Conscience fits in more with\nFreud's SuperEgo (plus the Moral Driver) with the stimulous being the\nurges or Freud's Id. The reasoning that I mentioned before is Freud's Ego,\nI suppose. If the Moral Driver is part of the Id then the reason why\nConscience cuts in unbidden is partially explained. The question is \"what\nprovides the stimulous to activate the Moral driver?\".

None of this sounds like a \"small\nfishing village\" by any stretch of the imagination.\n\nCenturies later, under the Abbasids, Tyre had \"opulent and flourishing\nbazaars\" and buildings of 5-6 stories.  During this period, Tyre was\n\"noted for its export of sugar, beads, and, as of old, glassware.\"\nDuring the Crusades, Tyre was the second-most flourishing city held\nby Franks.  (There is a lot more, but I got tired of writing.)\n\nIn [2] we read the following description of modern Lebanon: \"other\n*major cities* in Lebanon include Tripoli, Sidon, Tyre, Baalbek and\nZahlah.\"  [my emphasis]  This source also discusses the impact of\nthe Lebanese Civil War, and the Israeli military actions (1978, 1982)\non the trading ports of Tyre and Sidon.  It notes that after Israel's\nwithdrawel in 1984, \"Tyre appeared to enjoy a revival of its local\neconomy.\"\n\nIf Tyre is such an insignificant little fishing village at present,\nwhy is it always called a city (or, above, a \"major city\")?  Why\ndoes it show up on all the maps?   When population figures for cities\nin Lebanon are given, why is Tyre always one of the cities on the\nlist (even if the list is only a dozen cities long)?\n\n[1] Philip K.

Perhaps these were figures for\nthe cities and their surrounding areas.)  I don't doubt that the\npopulation of Tyre has fluctuated over the last few decades.  In\nparticular, the 1982 Israeli military action hurt Tyre quite a bit.   \n\n\nI thought you were talking about times that Tyre was destroyed.\nDon't most, if not all, of these apply not just to Tyre but to \nthe other cities in the area?  Sidon, for example?  Can you make\na case for Tyre having been singled out?\n\n\nThey had a good deal of autonomy under the Seleucids.

My definition\nis this: Science is the investigation of the empirical that avoids\nmistakes in reasoning and methodology discovered from previous\n\n\nUnless one classifies \"thinking and informal exploration\" as a\nmistake, they fall under my definition.  I hope no one would\nconsider speculation, thinking, and informal exploration as\nunscientific.  \n\n\nHere is where I think we are talking at cross-purposes.  It is not\nclear to me that the kind of definition I have proposed should be\ntaken as describing what \"science is mainly about.\"  Consider,\nfor example, a definition of invertebrates as all animals lacking\na backbone.  This fairly tells what is an invertebrate and\nwhat is not an invertebrate, but it hardly tells you what\ninvertebrates are all about.  One can read this definition and\nstill not know that 95% of all animal species are invertebrates,\nthat invertebrates possess a remarkably broad range of form, that\nsome invertebrate groups -- such as insects and nematodes -- are\nubiquitous in all ecosystems, etc.  In short, knowing the\ndefinition of invertebrates does *not* tell one what they are\n\"mainly about.\"\n\nThe misunderstanding here is my fault.  I did not give sufficient\ncontext for people to understand my proposed definition.\n\n\nI agree on both counts.  As an example of the second, it would only\ntake a few cases of curing rabies to convince most veterinarians\nthat a treatment was effective, despite a lack of controls.  \n\nAs to the first, I do not think it is useful to talk about\n\"absolute scientific truth.\"  I think it is more useful to talk\nabout the kinds of evidence that various claims have and the\nkinds of evidence IN PARTICULAR FIELDS that in the past have\nproven faulty or reliable.  The latter is obviously a matter of\ndegree, and in each field, practitioners try to discover the\nrelevance of different kinds of evidence.  \n\nOne of the primary mistakes that marks the advocacy of an idea as\npsuedo-science is that the advocacy lacks any sense of proportion\nregarding the kinds of evidence related to the proposed claim,\nthe kinds of evidence that are actually relevant to it, and the\nhistorical reasons in the field that certain kinds of evidence\nare given more weight than others.  It is perfectly alright to\nspeculate.  I have read quite a few refereed papers that\nspeculated left and right.  But the authors were careful to\nidentify the notions as speculative, to list what little evidence\nwas presently available for them, and to describe how research\ncould proceed to either put the notion on more firm footing or to\nuncover its problems.  Often what distinguishes whether a paper\nof this sort passes muster is the thoughtfulness with which the\nauthor sets the context and paves the way for future work.  (It\nis in this area that many proponents of speculative ideas fail.)\n\n\nI think a lot of scientists steer away from things that --\ndeserving or not -- garner a patina of kookiness.  When\nproponents of some practice see no value in more careful\ninvestigation of that practice, that sets alarms ringing in many\nresearchers' minds.  \n\nThis is unfortunate, because there is undoubtedly some\nintersection between things that are worth investigating and\nthings that are advocated by those who seem careless or\nunreasonable in their advocacy.  On the other hand, I can\nunderstand why many scientists would just as soon select other\ndirections for research.  As Gordon Banks has pointed out, no one\nwants to become this generation's Rhine.\n\n\nI think this is absurd.  \n\n\nI wonder why the results were not published.  In my field,\ndissertation results are typically summarized in papers that are\nsubmitted to journals.  Often the papers are accepted for\npublication before the dissertation is finished.

I played\nElvira I & II, and think that Horrorsoft has finally made\na very playable game with Waxworks.  The look and feel is\nroughly the same as in the Elvira games, though the real time\nfighting is a little easier to survive.  The first two games,\nespecially Elvira II: Jaws of Cerberus made it very tough to\nstay alive and hit-point restoring was very difficult.  This \nis not to say that Waxworks is a walk in the park, but it is\nquite fair, in that there is always some weapon to be found\nthat is quite effective, or hint given as to the proper fighting\nstrategy.  In one of the four wax works to be explored, there is \nno fighting at all (well almost none), though all four contain\nmoderately challanging puzzles.\n\nThe really interesting thing about this game is that it is really \nbroken up into four seperate RPGs, one for each of the four exhibits\nyou must enter.  In starting each one, your character is transported\nwith no objects to use, and experience level 1.  One exhibits traps\nyou inside a multi-level ancient Egyptian pyramid which you must \nescape by fighting, mapping and puzzle solving.  Another exhibit\ntraps you in a mine that has been taken over by creeping plant vines\nand pods, while the local humans have been transformed into plant\nzombies.  This is a single level maze that requires you to rescue\nsome humans, kill the head plant alien, and figuere out how to kill\nthe very tuff plant zombies that are always showing up.  This is\nperhaps the most horrifying exhibit.  Another exhibit puts you into\nJack The Ripper England where you appear by the corpse of a fresh Ripper\nvictim, and of course the police think you are responsible.  You must\navoid police and angry mobs to unravel the mystery of The Ripper and \nmeet him face to face - but first get a disquise.  The last exhibit\npus you in a graveyard where most of the challenge is in learning to \nstop the almost indestructible zombies.  \n\nOver all the VGA graphics and music are very effective in setting a \ncreepy tone for the game, as was the case for the Elvira games, though\ngameplay is much improved and makes for a much more enjoyable game.\nI heartily recommend it for RPG and Horror fans.   \n\n*********************************************************\n\n- All prices include shipping.\n- All games are in excellent condition unless otherwise stated.\n- US buyers only please.\n- All games will be shipped inside a box with packing, insured,\n  priority USPS.\n- All games include all original materials including box, manual,\n  disks, and registration unless otherwise noted.\n\nThe first responder offering asking price is guarenteed to\nget the game.

When work for a large program like\n   Freedom or Shuttle is performed at a NASA center, the\n   center skims off a portion which goes into what amounts\n   to a slush fund. This money is used to fund work the\n   center manager wants to fund. This sum is estimated to\n   be over a third of the funds allocated. Think about\n   that: Of the $30 billion cost of Freedom, fully $10\n   billion won't be spent on anything having anything\n   to do with Space Stations! Now, maybe that $10 billion\n   was wisely spent (and maybe it wasn't), but the work done\n   with it should stand on its own merits, not distorting\n   the cost of other projects. Congress has no idea of the\n   existense of these wraps; Congress has never heard the\n   term 'center tax'. They look at the Station they are\n   getting and the price they are paying and note that\n   it doesn't add up. They wonder this blissfully unaware\n   that a third of the money is going for something else.\"\n\nMy dear friends, your mixing fact and fiction here. A couple\nof weeks ago, when I first read this in your posting, I\ntalked with one of the cost experts here in Space Station\nat Headquarters [if you wondering why I didn't post a\nresponse immediately, I do have a real job I'm supposed\nto be doing here at Headquarters, & digging up old 20 kHz\ndata & looking into Sherzer/Kyger claims rates pretty low\non the totem pole of priority. Also, I spent last weekend\nin Kansas City, at the National Science Teachers \nAssociation conference, extolling the virtues of SSF\nto 15,000 science teachers.]\n\nFirst off, yes, the concept of 'center tax', or 'wrap' does\nexist. If I recall the numbers correctly, the total 'tax'\nfor the SSF program for this fiscal year is around $40 Million.\nThis was computed by adding up the WP-1, WP-2, and WP-4\ncenter 'taxes'. With the SSF budget for this fiscal year at\n$2.2 Billion, my calculater says the tax percentage is\n04/2.2 = 1.8%\n\nOver the life of the SSF program, using your figure of $30\nbillion for the cost of SSF, a tax at a 1.8% rate comes to\n$540 million. This is alot less than $10 billion, but I\nwill concede it's still an appreciable amount of pocket\nchange.\n\nI should note that your estimate of the tax rate at 1/3 could\nbe close to the actual rate. The tax is only charged on funds\nthat are spent at the center (kind of like McDonalds at some\nstates, where you do have to pay sales tax if you eat\nthe food at the restaurant, but you don't if you get it\ntake-out). For example, at WP-4, the vast bulk of the funds\nwe receive go to the Rocketdyne Contract, and are *NOT*\nsubject to the center tax (I don't have the numbers in\nfront of me, but I'd guess at least 95% of the WP-4 funds\ngo to Rocketdyne). So, you could be right about a tax\nrate of 1/3, but it's only applied to funds spent at the\ncenter, and not to the prime contracts.\n\nThis leads to the obvious question \"What is the government\ndoing with SSF funds that don't go to the prime contractors?\n(i.e. ok, WP-4 gets a slice of the $30 billion pie. A\nbig portion of this slice goes to Rocketdyne. What happens\nto the balance of the funds, which aren't eaten\nup by the center tax?)\"\n\nAt WP-4, we call these funds we spend in-house supporting\ndevelopment funds (as they are supporting the development\nwork done by Rocketdyne). We have used these funds to\nsetup our own testbed, to checkout the electrical\npower system architecture. Our testbed has a real life\nsolar array field (left over from solar cell research\nresearch a few years back), with lead-acid car batteries\n(to simulate the Nickel-Hydrogen batteries on SSF), DC\nswitchgear, DC-DC converter units, and simulated\nloads. Data from the testbed was used in a recent\nchange evaluation involving concerns about the stability\nof the power system.\n\nWe have also used the supporting development money to\npurchase Nickel Hydrogen batteries, which are on life\ntesting at both Lewis and the Crane Naval facility in\nIndiana. As a side point, 6 of the battery cells on\ntest recently hit the four year life test milestone.\n38 cells have completed 18,552 to 23,405 cycles (the\non-orbit batteries go through 5,840 cycles per year).\n\nAs a final example, my 'home' division at Lewis used\nthe supporting development funds to purchase personal\ncomputers and work stations, for performing system\nanalyses (like modeling of the performance of the\nelectrical power system, availability calculations\nusing a Monte-Carlo simulation, setting up a \ndatabase with information on weight of the power\nsystem elements).\n\nFinally, the money raised by the 'tax' does not all\ngo into a 'slush fund.' At Lewis, the director\ndoes control a small discretionary fund. Each year,\nany individual at Lewis can submit a proposal to\nthe director to get money from this fund to look\nat pretty much anything within the Lewis Charter.\n\nMost of the tax, however, goes to fund the 'general'\nservices at the Center, like the library, the \ncentral computer services division, the Contractor \nwho removes the snow, etc. Thus, it is rather\ndifficult to determine what percentage of the\nSSF budget doesn't go for SSF activities. To get\nan accurate figure, you would have to take\nthe annual expenditure for the library (for example),\nand then divide by the amount of the library funds\nused to support SSF (which would be hard to\ncompute by itself - how would you figure out\nwhat percentage of the bill for Aviation Week for\n1 year is 'billable' to SSF, would you base it on\nthe person-hours SSF employees spend reading AV-week\nversus the rest of the center personnel). You would\nthen have to compare this estimate of the SSF\nportion of the library expense with the portion of\nthe tax that goes to support the library. Who knows,\nmaybe SSF overpays on the tax to run the library, but\nwe underpay for snow removal? Talk about\na burecratic nightmare!"},{"role":"assistant","content":"sci.space"}]}

A spade is a spade.  There is no hidden\nagenda behind this, so stop trying to look for one.   It is an\neasy and as straight forward as it reads.\n\nKent, I am not accusing you of evil things.  Jesus is accusing you.\nAnd it is not only you that He is accusing.  He is accusing everyone.\nMe, you and everyone in the world is guilty.  Whether one\nsees the light or does not seen the light has nothing to do with \nwhether we do evil things.  We do them regardless.  \n\nJesus uses the word \"men\".  I am included.  Jesus is not soloing you out.\nJesus is making a general statement about out the sad state of man.\nChristians are not immuned from doing evil things.  A Christian \nis just a person in whom the Holy Spirit indwells.  A Christian \ncan see the evil he is doing--because his evil has been brought\nout into the light.  Jesus is not saying that just because evil has been\nexposed, that the Christian will stop doing evil.  If you haven't\nseen Jesus's light, your evil deeds simply haven't been\nexposed to the His light.  You may shed some light on your\nown.  Your human spirit shines at perhaps 1 candela.  But the\nHoly Spirit shines at a Megacandela.  The Holy Spirit can\nshine light into places inside us where we didn't even know\nexisted. \n\nSo do you see Jesus's point?  Christians are not perfect.  Nonchristians\nare not perfect.  Nonchristians do not want to come into the\nLight of Jesus because they will see all the problems in their lives,\nand they will not like the sight.  It is an ugly thing to see how far\nwe have fallen from Jesus's perspective.  Do you think you want to\nknow how really ignorant you are?  Do you think Brian Kendig wants\nto know?  Do you think I want to know?  Ego verses the truth,\nwhich do you choose?\n\n\nAnd I watched Koresh too, an imposter who thought he saw the light, \nwho made sure that the 19 children burned to death, sadly, as part\nof his delusion.  It is even sadder that the people who\ndied with him chose to die with them, and that ignorance was\ntheir downfall to death. \n\nAnd Kent, don't you bury yourself underneath a rock with an\nexcuse like bringing up Koresh--as if Koresh actually had truth in him.\nDavid Koresh was no light and no excuse for\nyou to stay away from the real Jesus Christ.  David Koresh, who\nclaimed to be Jesus, was a fraud.  It was obvious.  David Koresh\nwas born in America. Jesus was born in Bethlehem.  Koresh wasn't\neven a good imposter having missed an obvious point as that.\n\nJesus warned of such imposters in the end-times.  David\nKoresh wasn't anything new to Jesus.  Jesus told us to be\naware of imposters 2000 years ago.  \n\nSo the next time an imposter makes a scene and claims to\nbe Jesus.  Ask the obvious.  Where were you born?  Was your\nmother's name Mary?  If the Branch Davidians asked that\nsimple question, they would have labeled Koresh a liar\nright from the start.  The wouldn't have followed Koresh.\nThey wouldn't have died.  But look what happened.  Their\nignorance cost them their lives.  Their choice to be ignorant\ncost them a lot.\n\nKent, since you studied the Bible under Lutheranism, do you\nnot remember what tactic Satan used to try to tempt Jesus?  \nDid not Satan quote the Bible out of context?  Do you\nremember what tactic the serpent of Genesis used to tempt\nEve?  Did he not misquote God?  What Satan used on Eve and succeeded, \nwas the same ploy he tried on Jesus.  But in Jesus's case,\nJesus rebuked Satan back with the Bible _in_ context.  It\ndidn't work with Jesus.  \n\nDoes what Satan did to Eve in the Garden and what Satan\ntried to do with Jesus in the desert remind you of what\nKoresh did to his followers?  Who did Koresh emulate?\nWho was Koresh's teacher?  Koresh did to his followers what\nSatan did to Eve.  Did not Koresh kill his followersr?  Did\nnot Satan cause Adam and Eve to die as well?  Did not\nthe cult followers believe Koresh even though they knew\nthe real Christ was born in Bethlehem?   Did not Eve\nchoose to eat from the tree of the knowledge of good and\nevil despite knowing that it would cause her death?  God\nheld them all responsible--deceiver and the rebeller.

Security Council Resolution 713 of \n  September 25, 1991, the United Nations has been actively \n  addressing the crisis in the former Yugoslavia.  The Security \n  Council acted in Resolution 781 to establish a ban on all \n  unauthorized military flights over Bosnia-Herzegovina.  There \n  have, however, been blatant violations of the ban, and villages \n  in Bosnia have been bombed.\n  \n  In response to these violations, the Security Council decided, \n  in Resolution 816 of March 31, 1993, to extend the ban to all \n  unauthorized flights over Bosnia-Herzegovina and to authorize \n  Member States, acting nationally or through regional organi-\n  zations, to take all necessary measures to ensure compliance.  \n  NATO's North Atlantic Council (NAC) agreed to provide NATO air \n  enforcement for the no-fly zone.  The U.N. Secretary General \n  was notified of NATO's decision to proceed with Operation DENY \n  FLIGHT, and an activation order was delivered to participating \n  allies.\n  \n  The United States actively supported these decisions.  At my \n  direction, the Joint Chiefs of Staff sent an execute order to \n  all U.S. forces participating in the NATO force, for the conduct \n  of phased air operations to prevent flights not authorized by \n  the United Nations over Bosnia-Herzegovina.  The U.S. forces \n  initially assigned to this operation consist of 13 F-15 and \n  12 F-18A fighter aircraft and supporting tanker aircraft.  \n  These aircraft commenced enforcement operations at 8:00 a.m. \n  e.d.t. on April 12, 1993.  The fighter aircraft are equipped for \n  combat to accomplish their mission and for self-defense.\n  \n  NATO has positioned forces and has established combat air \n  patrol (CAP) stations within the control of Airborne Early \n  Warning (AEW) aircraft.  The U.S. CAP aircraft will normally \n  operate from bases in Italy and from an aircraft carrier in the \n  Adriatic Sea.  Unauthorized aircraft entering or approaching \n  the no-fly zone will be identified, interrogated, intercepted, \n  escorted/monitored, and turned away (in that order).  If these \n  steps do not result in compliance with the no-fly zone, such \n  aircraft may be engaged on the basis of proper authorization by \n  NATO military authorities and in accordance with the approved \n  \n                                more\n  \n       \t    \t      \t   \t     \t       \t    (OVER)\n\f\n                                  2\n  \n  rules of engagement, although we do not expect such action will \n  be necessary.  The Commander of UNPROFOR (the United Nations \n  Protection Force currently operating in Bosnia-Herzegovina) was \n  consulted to ensure that his concerns for his force were fully \n  considered before the rules of engagement were approved.\n  \n  It is not possible to predict at this time how long such \n  operations will be necessary.  I have directed U.S. armed forces \n  to participate in these operations pursuant to my constitutional \n  authority as Commander in Chief.  I am grateful for the con-\n  tinuing support that the Congress has given to this effort, and \n  I look forward to continued cooperation as we move forward \n  toward attainment of our goals in this region.\n  \n       \t    \t      \t   \tSincerely,\n  \n  \n  \n  \n       \t    \t      \t   \tWILLIAM J.

Innocent \nMuslims were one by one cruelly bayonetted to death, or massacred with \naxes and swords, or else shut up in mosques or in schools and then burnt\nalive as can be seen below.\n\nWidespread Armenian massacres of innocent Muslims took place in regions \nof Van, Kars, Sivas, Erzurum, Bitlis, Erzincan, Mus, Diyarbakir and \nMaras. The Ottoman Army, while fighting to prevent the Russian invasion,\nalso had to deal with Armenian genocide squads who cowardly hit from \nbehind. The Armenian genocide of the Muslims spread to all parts of \nEastern Anatolia. Starting from late 1914, Armenians committed \nwidespread massacres and genocide in Eastern Anatolia, because the arena\nwas left to the Armenians. Almost every Turkish town and village from \nErzincan up to Azerbaidjan suffered large scale massacres and genocide \nby Armenians and the Turkish genocide has been documented by Armenian, \nRussian, American, British, Ottoman, German, Austrian and French \njournalists and officers who observed the first genocide of this century\ncommitted by the blood-thirsty Armenian genocide squads.\n\nThe Ottoman Army, liberating Trabzon, Bayburt, Erzincan, Erzurum, \nKars and other regions from the Russians, saw that the cities and their \nvillages had been destroyed and burnt, people slaughtered, massacred.\nThe massacres conducted by Armenians, which became a black stain for\nhumanity, shocked and disgusted even the Russian, British, German,\nAustrian, French and American authorities.\n\nAlmost every Ottoman document is related to Armenian massacres and \ncruelties. The inhuman treatment, cruelties, atrocities, genocide by \nArmenian genocide squads perpetrated against innocent Moslem Turkish \nand Kurdish people, are sufficiently reflected in historical documents. \nEven today over seventy-five years later, the terrifying screams of \nthe victims of these cruelties can be heard.\n\n\nSource: Documents: Volume I (1919).\n        \"Document No: 76,\" Archive No: 1/2, Cabin No: 109, Drawer \n        No: 3, File No: 346, Section No: 427(1385), Contents No: 3, 52-53.\n        (To Lt.

Although two months\n have elapsed since the clearing of the territories of Armenian gangs, I\n have been observing the evidence of the cruelties of the Armenians at \n almost every step. All the villages from Trabzon to Erzincan and from\n Erzincan to Erzurum are destroyed. Corpses of Turks brutally and cruelly\n slain are everywhere. According to accounts by those who were able to\n save their lives by escaping to mountains, the first horrible and fearful\n events begun when the Russian forces evacuated the places which were then\n taken over by Armenian gangs. The Russians usually treated the people \n well, but the people feared the intervention of the Armenians. Once these\n places had been taken over by the Armenians, however, the massacres begun.\n They clearly announced their intention of clearing what they called the\n Armenian and Kurdish land from the Turks and thus, solve the nationality\n problem. Today I had the opportunity to meet Austrian and German soldiers\n who had escaped from Russian prison camps and come from Kars and\n Alexander Paul (Gumru-Leninakan)...Russian officers tried to save the \n Turks and there were clashes between Russian officers and Armenian gangs. \n I am now in Erzurum, and what I see is terrible. Almost the whole city is \n destroyed. The smell of the corpses still fills the air. Although there are \n speculations that Armenian gangs murdered Austrian and German prisoners as \n well, I could not get the supporting evidence in this regard, but there is \n proof of murdering of Turkish prisoners of war.\"\n\n                                                     Dr. Stephan Eshnanie\n\nSerdar Argic"},{"role":"assistant","content":"talk.politics.mideast"}]}

EDT\n\n\t     \t  \n\t     Q\t  Why was the 10:00 a.m. postponed? \n\t     \t  \n\t     MS. MYERS:  Just due to scheduling conflicts.  So as we \nput out, the President will meet with the leaders of the national \npolice organizations at 2:00 p.m. in the Rose Garden, as opposed to \n10:00 a.m.  The only other things on his schedule today are:  At \n11:00 a.m. he'll meet with General Vessey, who, as you know, is on \nhis way to Vietnam to continue working on the MIA-POW issue.  At \n12:30 p.m. he'll have lunch with the Vice President in the Oval \nOffice.  And at 2:00 p.m. he'll meet with the police organizations.\nThen from 3:00 p.m. to 4:00 p.m. he'll do his weekly photos with the \nvarious groups.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  A photo op with Vessey?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  There's no coverage on the Vessey meeting.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Why?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  Why?  It's a closed meeting.  \n\t     \n\t     Q\t  What about the lunch?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  The lunch?  No, there's no coverage.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Is he meeting with any congress people today?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  Nothing scheduled.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  There are no meetings --\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  There are no congressional meetings today, \nno.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Has the President been given any information by the \nPentagon or reached any conclusion about the validity of this report \nfrom Hanoi?  Any instructions to Vessey on how to deal with the \nVietnamese on that subject?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  Well, clearly, the report is the first order \nof business.  It's high on the agenda on something that they'll \ndiscuss.  I think the President and General Vessey will discuss the \nparameters of his visit to Vietnam today, but the President hasn't \ndrawn any conclusions about the report yet.  Certainly, it's \nsomething that he wants General Vessey to talk with the Vietnamese \nabout first.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Did the President talk with any Republican senators \nyesterday about the stimulus package?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  He spoke with Senator Dole.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  How many times?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  I believe once during the day and once last \nnight.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  What was the outcome of that?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  They're continuing to work toward some kind \nof an agreement on a jobs package.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Is it your impression that Senator Dole is in any \nway flexible on this?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  Well, I think we're hopeful that we're going \nto get some kind of jobs package through the Senate, and we'll \ncontinue to work with Senator Dole and others until we reach some \nkind of an agreement.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Did they discuss the VAT tax?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  I don't know if that came up.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Can you check that?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  Sure.\n\n\t     Q\t  So what are they -- is the President offering to \nscale down his program -- is that what he's trying to do, buy it down \nto where Dole will sign on?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  Well, he's trying to protect as much of it \nas he can.  But it's important to him to get some kind of a jobs \npackage through the Senate and through Congress now.  And as soon as \nwe reach some conclusions on that, we'll let you know.  But at the \nmoment, he's continuing to consult with members of Congress \nincluding, obviously, Senator Dole.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Is he talking to anybody else?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  I don't believe he talked to any other \nRepublicans yesterday.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Is he talking to anybody today?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  I don't think anything is scheduled, but I \nwouldn't rule it out.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  We were led to believe that the President called \nMr. Dole on the subject of Russian aid and that Bob Dole brought the \nconversation around to stimulus package.  Is that correct?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  I think the President has contacted several \npeople on Russian aid.  I think that it was always expected that the \nstimulus package or the jobs package will be part of any conversation \nhe would have with Senator Dole.  The primary objective of the \nconversation was Russian aid.  That was the first order of business, \nbut it was both.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  In the President's mind, are they linked \npolitically in that if the Republicans continue to reject the \nstimulus package, he thinks it will be harder to sell Russian aid to \nthe American people?  Has he made that argument?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  I can't talk about specifically what \narguments he might have made.  The President is obviously committed \nto both.  He liked to see a jobs package to the American people \nfirst.  But as you know, we outlined the details of additional \nRussian aid last night in Tokyo.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  But does the President believe that the stimulus \npackage will make it more difficult to persuade Americans to vote for \nRussian -- to accept a vote for Russian aid?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  I think that the President is going to \ncontinue to work to pass the stimulus package, to pass a jobs \npackage, and we're still hopeful that we'll get some kind of jobs \npackage through the Congress.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Is it fair to say that the President is negotiating \nnow with Dole?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  He's discussing options with him.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  On the stimulus, is it your understanding that over \nthe break some Democrats, themselves, have left the support that they \nhad earlier for the package, the stimulus package?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  I think we still have wide support in the \nSenate for the jobs package.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  But specifically, that you've lost Democrats other \nthan Shelby?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  I don't believe so.  There hasn't been a \nvote.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  What about Kohl?\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Kohl and Feingold?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  There hasn't been a vote yet.  And we'll \ncontinue to work with senators to try to get a majority to try to \nbring the package to a vote, because we believe that a majority of \nthe members of the United States Senate support the package.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  If you're weren't worried about Kohl and Feingold, \nwhy did George mention Milwaukee projects the other day?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  I think George pointed out a number of \nprojects in a number of states that stand to be funded, or to lose \nfunding if this jobs package doesn't pass.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  No Democrats.  (Laughter.)\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  I'll let you draw your own conclusions.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Does he plan to talk to Dole again today or any \nother Republicans again today?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  There's nothing specifically scheduled, but \nagain, I wouldn't rule it out.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Does he plan to put out any more press releases to \nany other states today?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  What we've done is we're in the process of \nbreaking down the benefits of the jobs package state by state.  I \nthink it's entirely feasible that as we sort of are able to sum those \nup, we'll send out press releases to the various states that suggest \nhow their states would benefit from this package.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Will you share those with us?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  Sure.  As we did yesterday.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Do you have copies of the ones you sent --\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  Yes, we made those available yesterday.  And \nwe certainly can continue to provide them today.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Dee Dee, since yesterday's questions and subsequent \nstories about the VAT, what further consideration of this issue has \nbeen given?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  Nothing's changed since yesterday.  I think \nthe President commented on it this morning to say only that it was \nsomething he knew was being considered by the task force and that he \nhas not made a decision on, and I don't think we have anything to add \nto that.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  But he also said that business and labor groups are \ntelling him they support it.  Can you tell us --\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  I think that there has been -- I'm not going \nto speculate on who supports it.  I think the President said that \nthere has been some support among business and labor groups.  I don't \nthink he said he was directly contacted by them.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Are we to take that to mean that the administration \nhas sounded out business and labor groups on this --\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  I think there's been plenty of public \ndiscourse on this over the years and even recently, but I don't think \nI want to add to that.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  In February, though, the President said that this \nwas something to be considered 10 or 15 years down the road.  What \nhas happened between then and now to cause this administration to \nchange its mind?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  I think as we said yesterday, it is \nsomething that the working groups are looking at.  They're \nconsidering a wide variety of options on everything from funding to \nspecific options that will be covered by the President's health care \nplan.  The President has not taken it up yet, has not made a decision \non it.  And beyond that, I don't have anything to add.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  You haven't answered the question.  It wasn't being \nconsidered by anyone in the White House after the President's \ncomments in February, and George reaffirmed that in a briefing.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  And then suddenly --\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  What happened?\n\n\t     MS. MYERS:  The working groups, as we have said \nthroughout, we instructed to consider a wide variety of options \nacross-the-board.  And one of the things that has been talked about \nand that they are clearly considering is some kind of a value-added \ntax.\n\n\t     Q\t  But the President himself took this off the table, \nDee Dee, and suddenly it reappears.  And this goes to the credibility \nof this administration in a way.  What has happened in the meantime?\n\n\t     MS. MYERS:  The President has not looked at this, it \nhasn't been presented to him, again, yet.  The working groups are \nlooking at it, as they're looking at a wide variety of options, and \nno decisions have been made.\n\n\t     Q\t  And it raises the question of how independently the \ntask force is working.\n\n\t     MS. MYERS:  The task force was instructed to consider \nall options, and they've taken that mandate seriously and they're \nconsidering all options.\n\n\t     Q\t  But that's not the impression that the President \nleft in February.  The impression he left was that this was something \nthat was long-range, to be looked at 10, 15 years down the road.  The \nclear implication of his remarks was that this was something that was \nnot on the table, not an option. \n\n\t     Q\t  \"If it changes I'll tell you.\"\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Bring him on.\n\n\t     Q\t  And you repeatedly referred to the President's \nremarks, telling us that those were still in operation.\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  It's changed, and we told you.  (Laughter.)\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  But that's what Alice Rivlin's comments and Donna \nShalala comments were about.  I mean, that seemed like an \norchestrated effort because you have two independent Cabinet officers \n--\n\n\t     MS. MYERS:  I wouldn't -- no, Alice Rivlin's not a \nCabinet member, first of all.  Second of all, it was not \norchestrated, but clearly, they both said yesterday and in the last \ncouple of days that it's something that's being looked at.  We \nconfirmed that yesterday.  And I don't have anything to add to that.\n\n\t     Q\t  Is it because he has very few options?\n\n\t     Q\t  Is this something that it will be incumbent upon \nthe task force to convince the President about?  In other words, has \nthe President himself personally ruled it out and it's now up to the \ntask force to convince him to put it back on the table?  Or is it, in \nfact, back on the table, having been placed there by discussions with \nthe President?  \n\n\t     MS. MYERS:  It is not the working group's mission at \nthis point to convince the President of anything.  It is their \nmission to put before him his options and to explain the benefits and \nthe costs and the basic pros and cons of each of those options.  I \nthink that they will certainly present the VAT to him in that \ncontext, and at this point he's not -- that presentation has not been \nmade, but it's something that he will hear and he has not made a \ndecision on.\n\n\t     Q\t  They will present it to him as one of his options, \nthough he specifically ruled it out?\n\n\t     MS. MYERS:  Correct.\n\n\t     Q\t  Dee Dee, is this more than a trial balloon?  Is \nthis a serious consideration that the working groups are giving to \nthis form of taxation?\n\n\t     MS. MYERS:  It's simply a statement of fact.  The \nworking groups are considering a wide variety of options on a number \nof issues relating to health care reform.  One of the options that \nthey're looking at is the VAT. \n\n\t     Q\t  Dee Dee, when the working groups were examining \nthis possibility, was this on the table during the same time period \nthat you were telling us that it was not?\n\n\t     MS. MYERS:  I don't know what the specific timing of \ntheir drafting of options is.  I don't know.\n\n\t     Q\t  Who was telling you that it was not under \nconsideration?\n\n\t     MS. MYERS:  I was referring back to the President's \ncomments.\n\n\t     Q\t  Have they discovered that the sin taxes won't raise \nenough money to fund the core benefit package?\n\n\t     MS. MYERS:  No, there's no decisions that have been made \non how to pay for the health care plan.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  I'm asking whether the projections --\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  There's a number of options depending on how \nthe plan is structured.  You can't decide how much the plan is going \nto cost until you decide what the plan is going to look like.  And so \nyou can't discuss what financing options have been ruled in our out \nuntil you know.\n\n\t     Q\t  Dee Dee, we've been told that they have a computer \nmodels on a number of possible packages.\n\n\t     MS. MYERS:  Correct.  \n\n\t     Q\t  The question is whether they have now determined \nwhether sin taxes would not produce enough money for even the barest \nminimum package.  That is not a very difficult computation.\n\n\t     MS. MYERS:  It is a question that you know that we're \nnot going to answer until -- there's a number of options being \nconsidered.  It depends on how the package is structured.  The exact \ndetails of the package and the financing mechanisms used to pay for \nthem are all among the decisions that have yet to be made.  \n\t     \n\t     Q\t  And when the President has been meeting with health \ncare -- his health care advisors, which we are told he has been doing \n--\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  Correct.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t     they have never once said to him, these are your \nfunding options, including the VAT?  He has never heard the word VAT \nin his --\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:    I am not going to comment on the specific \nnature of the daily -- they're not daily, but the quasi-regular \nbriefings.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Well, you have.\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  I have not, other than to say that he's not \nconsidered the VAT.  And I think that is a true statement.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  No, but you said that it has not been presented to \nhim as an option.\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  Correct.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  That doesn't mean he hasn't heard about it.\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  I'm not going to get into the details of \nwhat's discussed.  I think that statement stands for itself.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t     specific, Dee Dee.  When you say he hasn't \nlooked at it, do you mean that he hasn't looked at it in terms of \npaying for medical coverage, or hasn't looked at it in general?  \nBecause back in Chilicothe he was very specific in defining how it \nworks, what the advantages are, the whole thing.  It sounds like --\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  But that was -- I think in Chilicothe, if \nyou go back to his remarks there, it was a broader philosophical \ndiscussion of the tax structure.  And I think the comments were \ngenerally in reference to the overall economic plan.  But clearly, \nit's something that he's thought about in the broad context.  I mean, \nthat was clear in Chilicothe.  What I'm saying is that in the process \nof the working groups it's something that he hasn't considered yet.  \nIt's something that the working groups will present to him among the \nnumber of options, and that no decisions have been made.  And I'm not \ngoing to comment any further on the details of the meetings where \nhealth care issues are being discussed.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  It's your statement from this podium that no \ndiscussion of this has taken place.  You say that no option -- that \nthe option has not been presented to him.\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  That is correct.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Do you stand by -- does the White House still stand \nby George's statement in March that this will not be in the proposal?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  No decisions have been made.  We have \nnothing to add to what's already been said.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Let me follow up here.  Do you stand by what Rivlin \nsaid yesterday, that if any kind of VAT were to be used or \nconsidered, that other changes to the tax code would have to be made \nso that it would be less regressive?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  I'm not going to comment any further on what \nmight happen if.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  But do you stand by the previous conversations in \nFebruary that if there were to be a VAT, I think the President said \nyou'd exclude food and energy --\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  I'm not going to comment on the specific \nstructure of a decision that hasn't been made.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Was the President aware prior to Donna Shalala's \ncomments yesterday that this was under consideration by the working \ngroups?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  I don't know specifically what --\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Could you check for us, because that's a real \nimportant credibility question?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  Sure.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Since the task force was brought together this \nissue has been discussed, at the beginning and throughout, as one \nfairly painless way to raise a lot of money.  Were you all kept in \nthe dark?  Was the Press Office kept in the dark over the past month \nand a half when you've been denying that a VAT tax would be \nconsidered that it was actually on the table over there as an option?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  I think we've said all that we have to say.  \nIt is something the working groups are looking at.  The President has \nnot made a decision about it yet.  And beyond that, I have nothing to \nadd.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Well, sorry, Dee Dee, there are still a couple of \nquestions that we are going to have to ask because we have a problem \nwith credibility here -- yours primarily.  What we're asking is, if \nyou all were not told at all that this thing was being considered \nwhile you were coming out here and telling us that it was not, or if \nit's a case that you were coming out here and deliberately misleading \nus.\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  I don't believe that anyone has ever come \nout here and deliberately misled you from this podium -- ever --ever.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Has anyone tried to shade it a little bit to \nindicate something -- has anybody told anybody to come out --\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  We're not trying to shade answers or \ndeliberately mislead anybody.  I've said what I have to say about \nthis issue.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  All we were trying to find out --\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  I understand what you're trying to find out \nand I've given you the answers, Helen.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  We're trying to find out what changed -- what made \nit an option again.  That's the --\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  The working groups were given a broad \nmandate to investigate all options, and they are doing that.  \n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Yes, but it wasn't an option before.  How can you \ninvestigate it if the President has taken it off the table?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  It is something that they're obviously \nconsidering and the President has not made a decision on.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Yes, but he took it off the table in February.\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  Working groups are considering it.  They'll \npresent it to the President at some point and he'll make a decision.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Why would they consider it if he has taken it off \nthe table?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  It's clearly on the table. \n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Yes, but he took it off the table.  Did he change \nhis mind?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  It's back on the table, Bill.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Did he change his mind?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  He said this morning that he hasn't made a \ndecision about it.  He obviously knows that it's on the table.  It's \nsomething that he will look at at some and when we have a decision on \nthis we'll let you know.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  So he must have changed his mind, right?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  At some point it will be looked at.  I mean, \n--\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Dee Dee, there's like two options -- either he \nchanged his mind or the working groups think they're authority \nexceeds the President's.\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  The working groups were given a broad \nmandate to look at all options; they've done that.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Are you going to put out his income tax?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  Yes, there will be something available on \nhis income tax probably later this afternoon.  His return will be \navailable. \n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Will there be any kind of briefing to go through \nit?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  No, nothing's planned.  I think someone will \nbe available, probably not in a briefing setting, but to walk you \nthrough the questions.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  We're used to be walked line-by-line through the \npresidential tax forms.\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  I've seen those briefings.  (Laughter.)\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Could we have one?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:   No, I don't think there will be any kind of \na formal briefing, but there will be somebody available to answer \nyour questions about it.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Did they file a joint form?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  Yes.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  When did he file it?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  I believe it's being filed today.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Dee Dee, is there going to be a backgrounder for \nMiyazawa?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  No, there will be a readout after the \nmeeting.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  No backgrounder today?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  No backgrounder today.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  This is complicated stuff.  We need help.  \n(Laughter.)\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  We can't give you taxes and Miyazawa all in \none day, it's too confusing.  (Laughter.)\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Vance and Owen have opened the doors on the use of \nforce in Bosnia.   They've both said that, A, they never ruled it \nout, and B, it might be necessary now.  Does that influence your \nthinking on whether or not to change your approach?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  There's been no change in our policy towards \nBosnia.  We have always said that we'd consider --\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  But does that impact upon your decision?  Are they \npeople whose opinions would carry weight with you?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  They're people whose opinions carry weight \ncertainly.  I mean, the President supports the process that they've \ninitiated.  But there's been no change in our policy for Bosnia, \nalthough we're considering a number of options right now.  If the \nSerbs don't come back to the negotiating table, if they don't sign on \nto some kind of an agreement, we will consider additional options, \nwhich we've been saying regularly.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  One follow-up question then?  We cannot get a \nstraight answer from anyone in the administration.  Why do you not \nset a deadline for the Serbs?  Can you tell us the strategic or \ntactical reasons for not giving them a deadline to come to the table?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  We're continuing to put pressure on them \nevery day.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Which doesn't work so --\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  Well, we think it is having some effect.  \nWe're going to continue to tighten sanctions.  As you know, we \nsupport the omnibus resolution.  We expect that to come to a vote on \nthe 26th.  \n\t     \n\t     Q\t  You say it's having an effect -- can you give us \nany documentation?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  I'd be happy to provide somebody to talk to \nyou about the impact of the sanctions and things like that.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  There's been no -- you have not been able to \nprovide anybody who can tell us that the sanctions have had any \neffect in Bosnia.  Serbia, yes; in Bosnia, no.\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  I think that they've had effect in Serbia \nand we think they've had some effect in Bosnia.  And again, I'll be \nhappy to provide somebody to walk you through the details of that, if \nyou'd like.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  We would like to hear from someone who can show us \nwhat the effect has been in Bosnia.  We had the briefing on all of \nthe terrible things that are happening in Belgrade, but we haven't \nseen anything that indicates an impact on the fighting.  Can you \nprovide something along those lines?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  I will see what I can get you.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  On the extra Russian aid that Christopher announced \nthis morning -- where is that money coming from?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  We'll have to work with Congress on the \ndetails of that package.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  So that would be new money that you would hope to \nget?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:    Yes, that's new money, in addition to the \n$1.6 billion announced in Vancouver.  So I assume that you all have \nseen the $1.8-billion package that was announced this morning in \nTokyo by Secretary Christopher.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Isn't there a concern, though, about offering \nsomething which you have to get in Congress?  I mean, that was the \nconcern with Vancouver; you didn't want to do that.\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  The concern with Vancouver was to do \nsomething immediately, which required money that was already approved \nin the Fiscal '93 budget.  What we're looking at now is a little bit \nlonger-term plan to build on top of the $1.6 billion that we \nannounced in Vancouver.  This clearly will require congressional \napproval, or some of it will anyway, and we're going to continue to \nwork with Congress to make that happen.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  To what extent has that been vetted or agreed to by \nCongress?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  The President has had a number of \nconversations with members and will continue to work with them as \nthis process moves forward.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Was Christopher able to put this package out with a \nfair degree of understanding that you will be able to get it through \nCongress?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  It was created in consultation with \nCongress.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  In meeting with the law enforcement officials, is \nthat -- does that have a set speech and a goal?  A direction?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  Yes, the President will talk about -- and \nthe law enforcement organizations are endorsing the President's jobs \npackage.  They believe particularly the summer jobs package will help \ngive kids something to do.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Who are they?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  It's members or leadership from three \norganizations:  NAPO, which is the National Association of Police \nOrganizations; IBPO, which is the International Brotherhood of Police \nOrganizations, I believe; and IUPA, which is the International Union \nof Police Associations.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Will the FBI chief be there?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  The FBI chief?  No.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Or any other federal law enforcement officials?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  No, it will be the President and these \nnational law enforcement organization leaders.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Does the $1.8 billion announced today include the \n$400 million that's in the FY '94 budget for disarmament?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  No.  The Nunn-Lugar money is separate.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  So this would be the $700 million that's in the \nbudget already, plus another $1.1 billion?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  I believe all of this is on top of the $700 \nmillion already in the budget.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Is this going to be part of the supplemental or \nFiscal '94 --\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  We'll work with Congress on the exact \nfunding mechanism -- on exactly how this will be paid for.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  This $1.8 billion on top of --\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  On top of $700 million -- on top of the $400 \nmillion Nunn-Lugar money we announced earlier.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  And this is what prompted the President to call Bob \nDole -- it was on this tranche, not on the previous money he was \ncalling Bob Dole?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  Correct.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Is there a briefing on Miyazawa?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  There will be a readout after the meeting \nwith Miyazawa.  Tomorrow.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Dee Dee, on a totally unrelated matter, some \nRepublicans who are active in the U.S. Chamber of Commerce are \ncomplaining about this new cozy relationship between the White House \nand the Chamber of Commerce.  There are -- the town hall meeting the \nother night, the satellite and all of this relationship.\nDoes the White House feel that you're getting too close to these \nChambers of Commerce?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  That's an interesting charge.  (Laughter.)  \nAfter how many years of Democrats being accused of not paying any \nattention to the Chambers, now there are those who would accuse us of \nbeing too close.  I think that's interesting.  But no, we're thrilled \nby the support we've received from the national Chamber and local \nChambers across the country and we'll continue to work with them on \nthis and other initiatives.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  What's the status of the President thinking about \ngoing to this Democratic retreat?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  It's on his calendar.  I think he'll almost \ncertainly go.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  All three days?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  We haven't figured out exactly when he'll be \nthere yet.  \n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Is it open to coverage?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  No, I believe the whole thing is closed.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Is he going to have any kind of address, statement, \nanything at all on the gay rights march on the 25th?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  We're still looking at that.  We haven't \nmade a final decision about how we'll -- who will make a statement or \nwhat --\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Any meetings scheduled with any of the leaders?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  Nothing is scheduled, but I wouldn't rule it \nout.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  What about an AIDS czar?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  It's coming.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Anything on the weekend?\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  There's been a suggestion that he's going to this \nretreat to avoid having to participate in the gay rights -- or appear \nor have any involvement in the gay rights march.\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  No, I think this is something he's been \ndiscussing for a long time -- appearing at the Senate Democratic \nretreat.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  The weekend?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  Weekend?  Don't know -- the only thing on \nright now is the radio address on Saturday.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Any travel plans?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  If it changes -- none right now.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  He's not going to be off campaigning for his \nstimulus package?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  No specific plans right now.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  What about mid-week?  Anything likely?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  It's possible.  Yes, I think it's likely \nthat we'll travel next week -- certainly the weekend.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Has he called Thurmond about his daughter?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  I don't know.  I'll check.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  Going to name a drug czar this weekend?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  This weekend?  I don't believe so.\n\t     \n\t     Q\t  And the radio address on Saturday -- is that going \nto be focused on the stimulus package?\n\t     \n\t     MS. MYERS:  I'm sure it will.\n\t     \n\t     THE PRESS:  Thank you."},{"role":"assistant","content":"talk.politics.misc"}]}

The CPU in the\nmiddle would do the encryption with a version of pgp modified to work on\na byte stream.\n\nWith v32bis or better modems to carry the bytestream, it should work. \nQuality would only be marginally lower than a normal telephone.\n\nAt the very highest price, you could use one of those voice-mail compatible\nmodems to do the digitisation - that puts an upper bound of about $500 on\nthe cost of such a box.

Rana  (rana@rintintin.colorado.edu)  \nCo-Moderator:  Dr. Tahir Ijaz  (ijaz@ccu.umanitoba.ca)\n\n\n\nA BRIEF DESCRIPTION ABOUT AHMADIYYA/ISLAM:\n=========================================\n\n\n        The Ahmadiyya Movement in Islam, an international organi-\nsation, was founder in 1989 in Qadian, India. The founder of this\nsect, Hazrat Mirza Ghulam Ahmad (1835-1908), proclaimed to be the\nPromised Reformer of this age as foretold in almost all the major\nreligions of the world today (Islam, Christianity, Judiasm,  Hin-\nduism).  He  claimed  to  be  the  long awaited second comming of\nJesus Christ (metaphorically), the Muslim Mahdi, and the Promised\nMessiah.  He  claimed that the prophecies contained in almost all\nthe great religions of the world about the advent of a  messenger\nfrom God have been fulfilled.\n\n        The claims Hazrat Ahmad raised storms  of  hostility  and\nextreme  oposition from many priestlike people of Muslims, Chris-\ntians, Jews and Hindus of that age. Such opposition is often wit-\nnessed  in  the history of divine reformers. Even today this sect\nis being persecuted specially in  some  of  the  Muslim  regimes.\nDispite  the  opposition  and persecution, this sect has won many\nadherents in 130 countries. It has over 10 million followers, who\ncome from a diverse ethnic and cultural background.\n\n        The sect is devoted to world peace and in bringing  about\na better understanding of religion, and the founders of all reli-\ngions. Its mission is to unite mankind into one Universal  broth-\nerhood  and  develop  a  better  understanding  of  faith. Ahmadi\nMuslims have always been opposed to all kind of violence and spe-\ncially religious intollerance and fundamentalism.\n\n        Among its many philanthropic activities, the sect has es-\ntablished  a network of hundreds of schools, hospitals, and clin-\nics in many third world countries. These institutions are staffed\nby  volunteer  professional  and are fully financed by the sect's\ninternal resources.\n\n        The Ahmadiyya mission is to bring about a universal moral\nreform,  establish  peace and justice, and to unite mankind under\none universal religion.\n\n\nNEWSGROUP CREATION: \n=================="},{"role":"assistant","content":"soc.religion.christian"}]}

I was referring to the fact\nthat far more aeronautical development took place in the '30's.  For much\nof the '20's, the super-abundance of Jennies and OX-5 engines held down the\nindustry.  By 1926, many of the obsolete WWI aircraft had been retired\nand Whirlwind had their power/weight ratio and reliability up to the point\nwhere long-distance flights became practical.  It's important to note that\nthe Atlantic was flown not once but THREE times in 1927:  Lindbergh,\nChamberlin and Levine, and Byrd's _America_.  \"When it's time to railroad,\nyou railroad.\"\n\n\n  Not off the top of my head; I'll have to dig out my reference books again.\nHowever, I will say that the most common arrangement in Prince Henry the\nNavigator's Portugal was for the prince to put up part of the money and\nmerchants to put up the rest.  They profits from the voyage would then be\nshared.\n\n\n  The problem is that the amount of prize money required to inspire a\nMoon Base is much larger than any but a handful of individuals or corporations\ncan even consider putting up.  The Kremer Prizes (human powered aircraft),\nOrteig's prize, Lord Northcliffe's prize for crossing the Atlantic (won in\n1919 by Alcock and Brown) were MUCH smaller.  The technologies required were\nwithin the reach of individual inventors, and the prize amounts were well\nwithin the reach of a large number of wealthy individuals.  I think that only\na gov't could afford to set up a $1B+ prize for any purpose whatsoever.\n  Note that Burt Rutan suggested that NASP could be built most cheaply by\ntaking out an ad in AvWeek stating that the first company to build a plane\nthat could take off and fly the profile would be handed $3B, no questions\nasked.\n"},{"role":"assistant","content":"sci.space"}]}

If it is only\nused for that purpose, and does not extend to electronic mail or file\nencryption, then it IS an improvement over the current mass-produced\nstandard civilian technology which, with a few exceptions, is limited to\neasy-to-break inverters.\n\nNote that the big issue for the feds is the continued ability to wiretap.\nBefore we go off the deep end with long discusions about secure crypto for\ne-mail and files, let's focus on this.\n\nOne question that was not asked in the release is whether this proposal is\nlimited to telephony, or if the government intends to expand it.\n\nThough I share many of the concerns expressed by some, I find the proposal\nless threatening than many others, since right now most Americans have no\nsecure telephony, and any jerk with a pair of clip leads and a \"goat\" can\neavesdrop. This would also plug up the security hole in cellular and\ncordless phones.\n\n-------\n\nReading between the lines, I infer that the system is highly secure\nwithout access to the keys. This would meet the needs of U.S. businesses\nconfronted by rich and powerful adversaries, including French and Japanese\nsecurity services and rich Japanese companies. It allows the NSA to make\navailable some of its better stuff while protecting law enforcement needs.\n\nMost legitimate U.S. corporations trust the NSA, and would be delighted to\nhave a high-security system certified by them, even at the price of\ndepositing keys in escrow. I see no difficulty in creating a reliable\nescrow. Corporations entrust their secrets to attorneys every day of the\nweek, and that system has worked pretty well.\n\nFrom my point of view this is a fair starting point. There are concerns that\nneed to be addressed, including the reliability of the escrows. But in\nreturn we get access to high-security crypto. Many have suggested that DES\nand other systems may be breakable by the NSA and hence others similarly\nskilled and endowed. There is at least a good possibility (which should be\nchecked) that the proposed system is not so breakable. It doesn't have to\nbe, nor does it have to have trapdoors, if the government can get the keys\npursuant to a legitimate court order. Thus they can protect legitimate\ncommunications against economic adversaries, while still being able to\neavesdrop on crooks pursuant to a court order.\n\n------\n\nIn discussing this, let's try to avoid the nastiness, personal attacks and\nnoise of some previous threads. This is a substantive and technical issue,\nand personal remarks have no place in such a discussion.\n"},{"role":"assistant","content":"sci.crypt"}]}

Whether these things are a part of religion, an unpleasant\nside effect or (as Bobby would have it) the result of people switching\nbetween Religion and Atheism spontaneously, the results are the same.  \n\n@Religious groups have long been involved in the majority of the bloodiest\nparts of Man's history.@\n\nAtheists, on the other hand (preen,preen) are typically not an ideological\nsocial caste, nor are they driven to organize and spread their beliefs.\nThe overuse of Nazism and Stalinism just show how true this is:  Two groups\nwith very clear and specific ideologies using religious persecution to\nfurther their means.  Anyone who cannot see the obvious - namely that these\nwere groups founded for reasons *entirely* their own, who used religious\npersecution not because of any belief system but because it made them more\npowerfull - is trying too hard.  Basically, Bobby uses these examples\nbecause there are so few wars that were *not* *specifically* fought over\nreligion that he does not have many choices.\n\nWell, I'm off to Key West where the only flames are heating the bottom of\nlittle silver butter-dishes.\n\n-ciao"},{"role":"assistant","content":"alt.atheism"}]}

Decibels are all *ratios.* The question that remains in\nany ratio is the reference unit used. Sometimes, this will be a reference\npower, such as 1 milliwatt (given a certain circuit impedance which\nshould also be included in the fine print or known, like 50 ohms\nin an RF circuit of that impedance), leading to an accepted\nnotation of dBm. Maybe it might be dBV, disregarding the impedance of\nthe circuit and power developed, using 1 volt as reference *amplitude*\n(rather than reference power). Or, it might have an arbitrary or omitted\nreference that is not included in the notation, leading to just plain dB.\nSo. look at it this way--'dB' has an implied reference while notation\nsuch as 'dBm' has an explicit reference.\n\nFor power:\n\n  dB = 10*log( P(measured)/P(reference) )\n\nFor amplitude\n\n  dB = 20*log( A(measured)/A(reference) )\n\n'B' is for bel, which is a standard term for a log ratio to the base\n10, named after Alexander Graham Bell. A 'deci' Bel is 1/10 of a bel.\nIt has nothing to do with the Bell Telephone company except for\nthe common founder's name. The small 'd'/large 'B' is per SI notation\nconvention. I don't know anyone that's been crucified for messing it up.\n\nCommon references for audio are:\n\n\t0 dBm = 1 milliwatt across 600 ohms\n\t0 dBV = 1 volt\n\n\t0 VU (a zero on the VU meter) = +4 dBm  (pro gear line level)\n\t0 VU = -10dBV\t(consumer gear line level)\n\n\nOften times, a power amp VU meter will be aligned using\nthe rated power of the amp as the 0 dB point. It is all\ndone to whatever reference is reasonable for the application\nor moment.\n\nNote that in a circuit with a given (and maybe unknown) linear\nimpedance, if the amplitude goes up so many decibels, the\npower will also increase the same amount. This proof can be done\nwith the above two identities and ohm's law.\n\n-- \n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n       Dave Medin\t\t\tPhone:\t(205) 730-3169 (w)\n    SSD--Networking\t\t\t\t(205) 837-1174 (h)\n    Intergraph Corp.\n       M/S GD3004 \t\tInternet: dtmedin@catbyte.b30.ingr.com\n  Huntsville, AL 35894\t\tUUCP:  ...uunet!ingr!b30!catbyte!dtmedin\n\n   ******* Everywhere You Look (at least around my office) *******"},{"role":"assistant","content":"sci.electronics"}]}

It has happened before, and there is reason\nto believe it still goes on.\n\nRead this:\n\nFrom Ma'ariv, February 18 (possibly 28), 1992\n\nPUBLICATION BAN\n\n        The State of Israel has never officially admitted that for many\n        years there have been in its prisons Israeli citizens who were\n        sentenced to long prison terms without either the fact of\n        their arrest or the crimes of which they were accused ever\n        being made public.\n\nBy Baruch Me'iri\n\nAll those involved in this matter politely refused my request, one way\nor another: \"Look, the subject is too delicate.  If I comment on it, I\nwill be implicitly admitting that it is true; If I mention a specific\ncase, even hint at it, I might be guilty of making public something\nwhich may legally not be published\".\n\nThe State of Israel has never officially admitted that for many years\nthere have been in its prisons Israeli citizens who were sentenced to\nlong prison terms without either the fact of their arrest or the\ncrimes of which they were accused ever being made public. More\nprecisely: A court ordered publication ban was placed on the fact of\ntheir arrest, and later on their imprisonment.\n\nIn Israel of 1993, citizens are imprisoned without us, the citizens of\nthis country, knowing anything about it.  Not knowing anything about\nthe fact that one person or another were tried and thrown in prison,\nfor security offenses, in complete secrecy.\n\nIn the distant past -- for example during the days of the [Lavon - YA]\naffair -- we heard about \"the third man\" being in prison.  But many\nyears have passed since then, and what existed then can today no\nlonger be found even in South American countries, or in the former\nCommunist countries.\n\nBut it appears that this is still possible in Israel of 1993.\n\nThe Chair of the Knesset Committee on Law, the Constitution and\nJustice, MK David Zucker, sent a letter on this subject early this\nweek to the Prime Minister, the Minister of Justice, and the Cabinet\nLegal Advisor.  Ma'ariv has obtained the content of the letter:\n\n\"During the past several years a number of Israeli citizens have been\nimprisoned for various periods for security offenses.  In some of\nthese cases a legal publication ban was imposed not only on the\nspecifics of the crimes for which the prisoners were convicted, but\neven on the mere fact of their imprisonment.  In those cases, after\nbeing legally convicted, the prisoners spend their term in prison\nwithout public awareness either of the imprisonment or of the\nprisoner\", asserts MK Zucker.\n\nOn the other hand Zucker agrees in his letter that, \"There is\nabsolutely no question that it is possible, and in some cases it is\nimperative, that a publication ban be imposed on the specifics of\nsecurity offenses and the course of trials.  But even in such cases\nthe Court must weigh carefully and deliberately the circumstances\nunder which a trial will not be held in public.\n\n\"However, one must ask whether the imposition of a publication ban on\nthe mere fact of a person's arrest, and on the name of a person\nsentenced to prison, is justified and appropriate in the State of\nIsrael.  The principle of public trial and the right of the public to\nknow are not consistent with the disappearance of a person from public\nsight and his descent into the abyss of prison.\"\n\nZucker thus decided to turn to the Prime Minister, the Minister of\nJustice and the Cabinet Legal Advisor and request that they consider\nthe question.  \"The State of Israel is strong enough to withstand the\ncost incurred by abiding by the principle of public punishment.  The\nState of Israel cannot be allowed to have prisoners whose detention\nand its cause is kept secret\", wrote Zucker.\n\nThe legal counsel of the Civil Rights Union, Attorney Mordechai\nShiffman said that, \"We, as the Civil Rights Union, do not know of any\ncases of security prisoners, Citizens of Israel, who are imprisoned,\nand whose imprisonment cannot be made public.  This is a situation\nwhich, if it actually exists, is definitely unhealthy.  Just like\ncensorship is an unhealthy matter\".\n\n\"The Union is aware\", says Shiffman, \"of cases where notification of a\nsuspect's arrest to family members and lawyers is withheld.  I am\nspeaking only of several days.  I know also of cases where a detainee\nwas not allowed to meet with an attorney -- sometimes for the whole\nfirst month of arrest.  That is done because of the great secrecy.\n\n\"The suspect himself, his family, his lawyer -- or even a journalist --\ncan challenge the publication ban in court.  But there are cases where\nthe family members themselves are not interested in publicity.  The\njournalist knows nothing of the arrest, and so almost everyone is\nhappy...\"\n\nAttorney Yossi Arnon, an official of the Bar, claims that given the\nlaws as they exist in Israel today, a situation where the arrest of a\nperson for security offenses is kept secret is definitely possible. \n\"Nothing is easier.  The court orders a publication ban, and that's\nthat.  Someone who has committed security offenses can spend long\nyears in prison without us knowing anything about it.\"\n\n-- Do you find this situation acceptable?\n\nAttorney Arnon: \"Definitely not.  We live in a democratic country, and\nsuch a state of affairs is impermissible.  I am well aware that\npublication can be damaging -- from the standpoint of security -- but\ntotal non-publication, silence, is unacceptable. Consider the trial of\nMordechai Vanunu: at least in his case we know that he was charged\nwith aggravated espionage and sentenced to 18 years in prison.  The\ntrial was held behind closed doors, nobody knew the details except for\nthose who were authorized to.  It is somehow possible to understand,\nthough not to accept, the reasons, but, as I have noted, we at least\nare aware of his imprisonment.\"\n\n-- Why is the matter actually that serious?  Can't we trust the\ndiscretion of the court?\n\nAttorney Arnon: \"The judges have no choice but to trust the\npresentations made to them. The judges do not have the tools to\ninvestigate.  This gives the government enormous power, power which\nthey can misuse.\"\n\n-- And what if there really is a security issue?\n\nAttorney Arnon: \"I am a man of the legal system, not a security expert.\n Democracy stands in opposition to security.  I believe it is possible\nto publicize the matter of the arrest and the charges -- without\nentering into detail.  We have already seen how the laws concerning\npublication bans can be misused, in the case of the Rachel Heller\nmurder.  A suspect in the murder was held for many months without the\nmatter being made public.\"\n\nAttorney Shiffman, on the other hand, believes that state security can\nbe a legitimate reason for prohibiting publication of a suspect's\narrest, or of a convicted criminal's imprisonment.  \"A healthy\nsituation?  Definitely not.  But I am aware of the fact that mere\npublication may be harmful to state security\".\n\nA different opinion is expressed by attorney Uri Shtendal, former\nadvisor for Arab affairs to Prime Ministers Levi Eshkol and Golda\nMeir.  \"Clearly, we are speaking of isolated special cases.  Such\nsituations contrast with the principle that a judicial proceeding must\nbe held in public. No doubt this contradicts the principle of freedom\nof expression.  Definitely also to the principle of individual freedom\nwhich is also harmed by the prohibition of publication.\n\n\"Nevertheless\", adds Shtendal, \"the legislator allowed for the\npossibility of such a ban, to accommodate special cases where the\ndamage possible as a consequence of publication is greater than that\nwhich may follow from an abridgment of the principles I've mentioned.\nThe authority to decide such matters of publication does not rest with\nthe Prime Minister or the security services, but with the court, which\nwe may rest assured will authorize a publication ban only if it has\nbeen convinced of its need beyond a shadow of a doubt.\"\n\nNevertheless, attorney Shtendal agrees: \"As a rule, clearly such a\nphenomenon is undesirable. Such an extreme step must be taken only in\nthe most extreme circumstances.\""},{"role":"assistant","content":"talk.politics.mideast"}]}

{"messages":[{"role":"system","content":"You are a helpful assistant who can classify newsletters into the right categories."},{"role":"user","content":"Disclaimer -- This is for fun.\n\nIn my computerized baseball game, I keep track of a category called\n\"stolen hits\", defined as a play made that \"an average fielder would not\nmake with average effort.\"  Using the 1992 Defensive Averages posted\nby Sherri Nichols (Thanks Sherri!), I've figured out some defensive stats\nfor the second basemen. Hits Stolen have been redefined as \"Plays Kurt\nStillwell would not have made.\"\n\nOK, I realize that's unfair.  Kurt's probably the victim of pitching staff,\nfluke shots, and a monster park factor.  But let's put it this way:  If we\nreplaced every second baseman in the NL with someone with Kurt's 57.6% out\nmaking ability, how many extra hits would go by?\n\nTo try and correlate it to reality a little more, I've calculated Net\nHits Stolen, based on the number of outs made compared to what a league\naverage fielder would make.  By the same method I've calculated Net Double\nPlays, and Net Extra Bases (doubles and triples let by).\n\nFinally, I throw all this into a a formula I call Defensive Contribution, or\nDCON :->.  Basically, it represents the defensive contribution of a player.\nI add this number to OPS to get DOPS (Defense + Onbase Plus Slug), which\nshould represent the player's total contribution to the team.  So don't\ntake it too seriously.  The formula for DCON appears at the end of this\narticle.\n\nThe short version -- definition of terms\nHS -- Hits Stolen -- Extra outs compared to Kurt Stillwell\nNHS -- Net Hits Stolen -- Extra outs compared to average fielder\nNDP -- Net Double Plays -- Extra double plays turned compared to avg fielder\nNEB -- Net Extra Bases --  Extra bases prevented compared to avg. fielder\nDCON -- Defensive Contribution -- bases and hits prevented, as a rate.\nDOPS -- DCON + OPS -- quick & dirty measure of player's total contribution.\n\nNational League\n\nname            HS   NHS   NDP   NEB   DCON    DOPS\nAlicea, L.      50    21    2    -1    .160    .865\nSandberg, R.   108    42    1     1    .134   1.015\nThompson, R.    65    20    5    -1    .104    .852\nLind, J.        66     8   -2     1    .027    .571\nDoran, B.       31    -1    4     0    .014    .705\nDeShields, D.   51     1   -2     1   -.002    .755\nHarris, L.      25    -4    0     1   -.019    .602\nLemke, M.       43    -1   -5    -5   -.038    .573\nMorandini, M.   37    -9   -6     0   -.069    .580\nRandolph, W.    13   -16    3    -1   -.088    .582\nBiggio, C.      34   -26   -4     0   -.091    .656\nStillwell, K.    0   -43   -3    -1   -.236    .336\n\nOrdered by DOPS\n\n1.015 Sandberg\n .865 Alicea\n .852 Thompson\n .755 DeShields\n .705 Doran\n .678 *NL Average*\n .656 Biggio\n .602 Harris\n .582 Randolph\n .580 Morandini\n .573 Lemke\n .571 Lind\n .336 Stillwell\n\nAmerican League\n---------------\n\nname            HS   NHS   NDP   NEB   DCON    DOPS\nFletcher, S.    59    18    5     1    .116    .811\nReed, J.        83    17    3     1    .071    .708\nRipken, B.      56     9   -1    -1    .044    .631\nBaerga, C.      67     0   10     0    .029    .838\nBlankenship, L. 34     2    2     1    .023    .757\nMiller, K.      34    -4    1    -1   -.016    .725\nAlomar, R.      62     4   -9    -2   -.020    .812\nKnoblauch, C.   50   -13    7    -3   -.024    .718\nBordick, M.     37    -4   -2    -1   -.025    .704\nKelly, P.       42    -1   -5    -1   -.039    .636\nWhitaker, L.    40    -8   -1    -2   -.041    .806\nReynolds, H.    47    -6   -5     1   -.043    .603\nSax, S.         56    -6   -9    -1   -.052    .555\nSojo, L.        28   -11   -3     0   -.075    .602\n\nOrder by DOPS\n\n.838 Baerga\n.812 Alomar\n.811 Fletcher\n.806 Whitaker\n.757 Blankenship\n.725 Miller\n.718 Knoblauch\n.708 Reed\n.704 Bordick\n.691 *AL Average*\n.636 Kelly\n.631 Ripken\n.603 Reynolds\n.602 Sojo\n.555 Sax\n\nMore discussion --\n\nDCON formula:  ((NHS + NDP)/PA) + ((NHS + NDP + NEB)/AB)\nWhy such a bizzare formula?

EDT\n\n     THE PRESIDENT:  Good morning ladies and gentlemen.  It's\nan honor for me to welcome the University of Maine Black Bears, the\nwinner of the NCAA Division I hockey national championship to the\nRose Garden and the White House.  I understand from Senator Mitchell\nthat this is the first team from the University of Maine every to win\na national championship.  And we're glad to have them here.\n\n     I'm inspired not only by how the team pulled together to\nwin the championship, but how the entire state pulled together to\ncheer them onto victory.\n\n     Coming from a state that is also relatively small in\nsize, but also filled with pride and tradition and community, I can\nunderstand how the people of Maine must feel about the Black Bears.\nIn our state people are still talking about the time we won the\nOrange Bowl over the number one ranked football team, and that was\nback in 1978.  I'm sure that 15 years from now, the people of Maine\nwill as proud of this team as they are today.\n\n     You know, in my state football is a slightly more\npopular sport than hockey.  We don't have a lot of ice.  (Laughter.)\nBut after spending three months getting banged around in this town, I\ncan understand a little more about hockey than I did before I came\nhere.  Hockey is a tough game.  It's a hard-hitting sport.  It does\nhave one virtue though, there's a penalty for delay of game.  I wish\nwe had that rule in the Senate.  (Laughter.)\n\n     In government as in hockey, leadership is important.  In\nthe United States Senate, our team has a great captain, the Majority\nLeader and the senior Senator from Maine, George Mitchell; junior\nSenator -- Cohen looks so young, I can't imagine.  (Laughter.)  I'm\nactually bitter about Senator Cohen because he looks so much younger\nthan me.\n\n     On your hockey team, the captain Jim Montgomery has done\na great job.  He scored the winning goal late in the championship\ngame, leading you to a come-from-behind victory -- something else I\nknow a little bit about.\n\n     Sport brings out the best in individuals and in teams\nand in communities.  I share the pride that Senator Mitchell and\nSenator Cohen and Congressman Andrews and all the people of Maine\nmust feel for the Black Bears who have shown us all how to play as a\nteam, how to bring out the best in one another, and how to come from\nbehind.\n\n     I think it's important, as I ask young people from\naround America who have achieved outstanding things in working\ntogether, to come here to the White House to be recognized and\nappreciated by their country, to remember that those kinds of values\nand those kinds of virtues need to be ingrained in all of us for all\nof our lives.\n\n     We now have another role model, and I'm glad to have\nthem here today.  (Applause.)\n\n     (The President is presented with team jersey.)\n(Applause.)\n\n     THE PRESIDENT:  That's great.  I love it.  It's beautiful.\n(Applause.)\n\n     (The President is presented with an autographed stick.)\n\n     THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you.  That's great.  (Applause.)\n\n                             * * * * * *\n\n     Q  Mr. President, did you authorize the move on Waco\nthis morning, sir?\n\n     THE PRESIDENT:  I was aware of it.  I think the Attorney\nGeneral made the decision.  And I think I should refer all questions\nto her and to the FBI.\n\n     Q  Did you have any instructions for her as to how it\nshould be executed?\n\n     THE PRESIDENT:  No, they made the tactical decisions.\nThat was their judgment, the FBI.\n\n     Q  Is this a raid?\n\n     THE PRESIDENT:  And I will -- I want to refer you to --\ntalk to the Attorney General and the FBI.  I knew it was going to be\ndone, but the decisions were entirely theirs, all the tactical\ndecisions.\n\n     Q  What did you and Senator Mitchell talk about this\nmorning?\n\n     Q  Any chance for that stimulus package?\n\n     THE PRESIDENT:  Senator Mitchell ought to pay my\nquarter.  (Laughter.)  I was in there -- (laughter).\n\n     SENATOR MITCHELL:  You have to pay that quarter.\n\n     THE PRESIDENT:  I was ready.  (Laughter.)  Senator\nMitchell, he's worth a quarter any day.\n\n     Q  Any chance for your bill, sir?\n\n     THE PRESIDENT:  We talked about what was going to happen\nthis week in the Senate and about what other meetings we're going to\nhave for the rest of the week.  We only had about five minutes to\ntalk.  And we agreed we'd get back together later, around noon, and\ntalk some more.\n\n     Q  Senator Dole said over the weekend that your\ncompromise is no compromise.\n\n     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, I know he did, but, look, Senator\nDole and a lot of the other Republicans now in the Senate voted for\nthe same kind of thing for Ronald Reagan in 1983; and our research\nindicates that a majority of them over time voted for a total of 28\nemergency spending measures totalling over $100 billion when Reagan\nand Bush were President, in those administrations.  And many of those\npurposes were not nearly as worthy as putting the American people\nback to work.  I don't want to go back and revisit every one, but you\n\n\ncan do it.  You can look at the research there.  So this position\nthey're taking is not credible.  We have a very tough five-year\ndeficit reduction plan.  All these costs are covered during that time\nand then some.  And the very people that are saying this has all got\nto be paid for don't have much of a history on which to base their\nposition.  They've got 12 years of vote for stimulus measures of this\nkind that had very little to with putting the American people back to\nwork.  So I think we've got a chance to work it out, and I'm hopeful.\nWe'll see what happens today and tomorrow.  I'm feeling pretty good\nabout it.\n\n     THE PRESS:  Thank you\n\n                                 END       10:10 A.M. EDT\n\n -30-\n"},{"role":"assistant","content":"rec.sport.hockey"}]}

But\nsince public discussion is often irreverent, most Mormons would rather\nkeep silent than have a cherished practice maligned.\n\nBut there are certain elements of the ceremony which participants\nexplicitly covenant not to reveal except in conjunction with the\nceremony itself.\n\n\nThere are other interpretations to Christian history in this matter.\nOne must recall that most of what we know about the Gnostics was\nwritten by their enemies.  Eusebius claims that Jesus imparted secret\ninformation to Peter, James, and John after His resurrection, and that\nthose apostles transmitted that information to the rest of the Twelve\n(Eusebius, _Historia Ecclesiastica_ II 1:3-4).\n\nIrenaeus claims this information was passed on to the priests and\nbishops (_Against Heresies_ IV 33:8), but Eusebius disagrees.  He\nclaims the secret ceremonies of the Christian church perished with the\napostles.  Interestingly enough, Eusebius refers to the groups which\nwe today call Gnostics as promulgators of a false gnosis (Eusebius,\nop. cit., III, 32:7-8).  His gripe was not that thay professed *a*\ngnosis, but that they had the *wrong* one.\n\nWritings dealing with Jesus' post-resurrection teachings emphasize\nsecrecy -- not so much a concealment as a policy of not teaching\ncertain things indiscriminately.  In one story, Simon Magus opens a\ndialog with Peter on the nature of God.  Peter's response is \"You seem\nto me not to know what a father and a God is: But I could tell you\nboth whence souls are, and when and how they were made; but it is not\npermitted to me now to disclose these things to you\" (_Clementine\nRecognitions_ II, 60).  If any one theme underlies the _Recognitions_\nit is the idea that certain doctrines are not to be idly taught, but\ncan be had after a certain level of spiritual maturity is reached.\n\nNow one can approach this and other such evidence in many ways.  I\ndon't intend that everyone interpret Christian history as I do, but I\nbelieve that evidence exists (favorably interpreted, of course) of\nearly Christian rites analogous to those practiced by Mormons today.\n\n\nBut if Judaism and Christianity had such ceremonies, would you expect\nto read about them in public documents?  One can search the Book of\nMormon and other Mormon scripture and find almost no information on\ntemple worship.  Yes, you could establish that Mormons worship in\ntemples, but you would probably be hard pressed to characterize that\nworship.  On that basis, can we conclude that the Bible explains *all*\npractices which might have taken place, and that absence of such\ndescriptions proves they did not exist?\n\nMormon scholar Dr. Hugh Nibley offers us a list of scriptures from\nwhich I have taken a few:\n\n1. \"It is given unto you to know the mysteries of the kingdom of\nheaven, but to them it is not given\" (Matt. 13:11).\n\n2. \"All men cannot receive this saying, save they to whom it is given\"\n(Matt. 19:11).\n\n3. \"I have yet many things to say unto you, but ye cannot bear them\nnow\" (John 16:12).\n\n4. \"The time cometh, when I shall no more speak unto you in proverbs,\nbut I shall shew you plainly of the Father\" (John 16:25).\n\n5. \"... unspeakable words, which it is not lawful for a man to utter\"\n(1 Cor. 3:1-2).\n\n6. \"Many things ... I would not write with paper and ink; but I ...\ncome unto you and speak face to face\" (2 Jn. 1:12).\n\n(Nibley, _Since Cumorah_, pp. 92-94)\n\nAgain, these can also be interpreted many different ways.  I believe\nthey serve to show that not all doctrines which could have been taught\nwere actually taught openly.\n\n\nHistorically, Joseph Smith had been adiministering the temple\nendowment ceremony for nearly a year before joining the Freemasons.\nThere is diary evidence which supports a claim that the rite did not\nchange after Smith became a Mason.  It can be argued that Smith had\nample exposure to Masonic proceedings through the burlesque of his\ntime and through his brother Hyrum (a Mason), though no specific\nconnection has yet been established.\n\nMy conversations with Masons (with respect to temple rite\ntranscriptions which have appeared on the net) have led me to believe\nthat the connection from Masonry to Mormonism is fairly tenuous.  As\nour moderator notes, most of what was similar was removed in the\nrecent revisions to the temple ceremony.  I believe that critics who\ncharge that Mormon rites were lifted from Freemasonry do not have\nadequate knowledge of the rites in question.\n-- \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n         Jay Windley  *  University of Utah  *  Salt Lake City\n                    jwindley@asylum.cs.utah.edu"},{"role":"assistant","content":"soc.religion.christian"}]}

They left and I had an attack. I realized that the dan-\nger was past, and stopped controlling myself. I relaxed for a moment and the \nphysical pain immediately made itself felt. My heart and kidneys hurt. I had \nan awful kidney attack. I rolled back and forth on top of those Christmas\nornaments, howling and howling. I didn't know where I was or how long this \nwent on. When we figured out the time, later it turned out that I howled and \nwas in pain for around an hour. Then all my strength was gone and I burst into\ntears, I started feeling sorry for myself, and so on and so forth . . .\n\nThen someone came into the room. I think I hear someone calling my name. I \nwant to respond and restrain myself, I think that I'm hallucinating. I am \nsilent, and then it continues: it seems that first a man's voice is calling\nme, then a woman's. Later I found out that Mamma had sent our neighbor, the\none whose apartment she was hiding in, Uncle Sabir Kasumov, to our place, \ntelling him, \"I know that they've killed Lyuda. Go there and at least bring \nher corpse to me so they don't violate her corpse.\" He went and returned empty\nhanded, but Mamma thought he just didn't want to carry the corpse into his \napartment. She sent him another time, and then sent his wife, and they were \nwalking through the rooms looking for me, but I didn't answer their calls. \nThere was no light, they had smashed the chandeliers and lamps.\n\nThey started the pogrom in our apartment around five o'clock, and at 9:30 I \nwent down to the Kasumovs'. I went down the stairs myself. I walked out of the\napartment: how long can you wait for your own death, how long can you be \ncowardly, afraid? Come what will. I walked out and started knocking on the \ndoors one after the next. No one, not on the fifth floor, not on the fourth, \nopened the door. On the third floor, on the landing of the stairway, Uncle \nSabir's son started to shout, \"Aunt Roza, don't cry, Lyuda's alive!\" He \nknocked on his own door and out came Aunt Tanya, Igor, and after them, Mamma. \nAunt Tanya, Uncle Sabir's wife, is an Urdmurt. All of us were in their \napartment. I didn't see Karina, but she was in their home, too, Lying\ndelirious, she had a fever. Marina was there too, and my father and mother.\nAll of my family had gathered there.\n   \nAt the door I lost consciousness. Igor and Aunt Tanya carried me into the\napartment.\n\nLater I found out what they had done to our Karina. Mamma said, \"Lyuda, \nKarina's in really serious condition, she's probably dying. If she recognizes \nyou, don't cry, don't tell her that her face looks so awful.\" It was as though\nher whole face was paralyzed, you know, everything was pushed over to one \nside, her eye was all swollen, and everything flowed together, her lips, her \ncheeks . . . It was as though they had dragged her right side around the whole\nmicrodistrict, that's how disfigured her face was. I said, \"Fine.\" Mamma was \nafraid to go into the room, because she went in and hugged Karina and started \nto cry. I went in. As soon as I saw her my legs gave way. I fell down near the\nbed, hugged her legs and started kissing them and crying. She opened the eye \nthat was intact, looked at me, and said, \"Who is it?\" But I could barely talk, \nmy whole face was so badly beaten. I didn't say, but rather muttered something\ntender, something incomprehensible, but tender, \"My Karochka, my Karina, my \nlittle golden one . . . \" She understood me.\n\nThen Igor brought me some water, I drank it down and moistened Karina's lips. \nShe started to groan. She was saying something to me, but I couldn't \nunderstand it. Then I made out, \"It hurts, I hurt all over.\" Her hair was \nglued down with blood. I stroked her forehead, her head, she had grit on her \nforehead, and on her lips . . . She was groaning again, and I don't know how \nto help her. She calls me over with her hand, come closer. I go to her. She's\nsaying something to me, but I can't understand her. Igor brings her a pencil \nand paper and says, \"Write it down.\" She shakes her head as if to say, no, I \ncan't write. I can't understand what she's saying. She wanted to tell me \nsomething, but she couldn't. I say, \"Karina, just lie there a little while,\nthen maybe you'll feel better and you can tell me then.\" And then she says,\n\"Maybe it'll be too late.\" And I completely . . . just broke down, I couldn't\ncontrol myself.\n\nThen I moistened my hand in the water and wiped her forehead and eye. I dipped\na handkerchief into the water and squeezed a little water onto her lips. She \nsays, \"Lyuda, we're not saved yet, we have to go somewhere else. Out of this \ndamned house. They want to kill us, I know. They'll find us here, too. We need\nto call Urshan.\" She repeated this to me for almost a whole hour, Until I \nunderstood her every word. I ask, \"What's his number?\" Urshan Feyruzovich, \nthat's the head of the administration where she works. \"We have to call him.\" \nBut I didn't know his home number. I say, \"Karina, what's his number?\" She \nsays, \"I can't remember.\" I say, \"Who knows his number? Who can I call?\" She \nsays, \"I don't know anything, leave me alone.\"\n\nI went out of the room. Igor stayed to watch over her and sat there, he was \ncrying, too. I say, \"Mamma, Karina says that we have to call Urshan. How can \nwe call him? Who knows his telephone number?\" I tell Marina, \"Think, think, \nwho can we call to find out?\" She started calling; several people didn't \nanswer. She called a girlfriend, her girlfriend called another girlfriend and \nfound out the number and called us back. The boss's wife answered and said he \nwas at the dacha. My voice keeps cracking, I can't talk normally. She says, \n\"Lyuda, don't panic, get a hold of yourself, go out to those hooligans and \ntell them that they just can't do that.\" She still didn't know what was really\ngoing on. I said, \"It's easy for you to say that, you don't understand what's \nhappening. They are killing people here. I don't think there is a single \nArmenian left in the building, they've cut them all up. I'm even surprised \nthat we managed to save ourselves. \"She says, \"Well, OK, if it's that serious \n. . . \" And all the same she's thinking that my emotions are all churned up \nand that I'm fearing for my life, that in fact it's not all that bad. \"OK, \nfine, fine,\" she says, \"if you're afraid, OK, as soon as Urshan comes back \nI'll send him over.\"\n\nWe called again because they had just started robbing the apartment directly \nunder Aunt Tanya's, on the second floor, Asya Dallakian's apartment. She \nwasn't home, she was staying with her daughter in Karabagh. They destroyed \neverything there . . . We realized that they still might come back. We kept on\ntrying to get through to Aunt Tanya--Urshan's wife is named Tanya too and \nfinally we get through. She says, \"Yes, he's come home, he's leaving for your \nplace now.\" He came. Of course he didn't know what was happening, either, \nbecause he brought two of his daughters with him. He came over in his jeep \nwith his two daughters, like he was going on an outing. He came and saw what \nshape we were in and what was going on in town and got frightened. He has \ngrown up daughters, they're almost my age.\n\nThe three of us carried out Karina, tossed a coat on her and a warm scarf, and\nwent down to his car. He took Karina and me to the Maternity Home. . . No, \nfirst they took us to the po]ice precinct. They had stretchers ready. As\nsoon as we got out of the car they put Karina and me on stretchers and said\nthat we were in serious condition and that we mustn't move, we might have\nfractures. From the stretcher I saw about 30 soldiers sitting and lying on the\nfirst floor, bandaged, on the concrete floor, groaning . . . This was around\neleven o'clock at night. We had left the house somewhere around 1:30. When I \nsaw those soldiers I realized that a war was going on: soldiers, enemies\n. . . everything just like a war.\n\nThey carried me into some office on the stretcher. The emergency medical\npeople from Baku were there. The medical attendant there was an older \nArmenian. Urshan told him what they had done to Karina because she's so proud \nshe would never have told. And this aging Armenian . . . his name was Uncle \nArkady, I think, because someone said \"Arkady, get an injection ready,\" he \nstarted to fill a syringe, and turned around so as to give Karina a shot. But \nwhen he looked at her face he became ill. And he was an old man, in his \nsixties, his hair was all grey, and his moustache, too. He hugged Karina and \nstarted to cry: \"What have they done to you?!\" He was speaking Armenian. \"What\nhave they done to you?!\" Karina didn't say anything. Mamma came in then, and \nshe started to cry, too. The man tried to calm her. \"I'll give you a shot.\" \nMamma tells him, \"I don't need any shot. Where is the government? Just what \nare they doing? Look what they've done to my children! They're killing people,\nand you're just sitting here!\" Some teacups were standing on the table in \nthere. \"You're sitting here drinking tea! Look what they've done to my \ndaughters! Look what they've turned them into!\" They gave her something to \ndrink, some heart medicine, I think. They gave Karina an injection and the\ndoctor said that she had to be taken to the Maternity Home immediately. Papa \nand Urshan, I think, even though Papa was in bad shape, helped carry Karina \nout. When they put her on the stretcher, none of the medics got near her. I \ndon't know, maybe there weren't any orderlies. Then they came to me: \"What's \nthe matter with you?\" Their tone was so official that I wrapped myself tighter\nin the half-length coat. I had a blanket on, too, an orange one, Aunt Tanya's.\nI said, \"I'm fine.\" Uncle Arkady came over and was soothing me, and then told \nthe doctor, \"You leave, let a woman examine her.\" A woman came, an \nAzerbaijani, I believe, and said, \"What's wrong with you?\" I was wearing my \nsister Lyuda's nightshirt, the sister who at this time was in Yerevan. When \nshe was nursing her infant she had cut out a big hole in it so that it would \nbe easier to breast feed the baby. I tore the night shirt some more and showed\nher. I took it off my shoulders and turned my back to her. There was a huge \nwound, about the size of a hand, on my back, from the Indian vase. She said \nsomething to them and they gave me two shots. She said that it should be \ndressed with something, but that they'd do that in the hospital.\n\nThey put me on a stretcher, too. They started looking for people to carry me. \nI raised up my head a little and wanted to sit up, and this woman, I don't \nknow if she was a doctor or a nurse, said, \"Lie still, you mustn't move.\" When\nI was lying back down I saw two policemen leading a man. His profile seemed \nvery familiar to me. I shouted, \"Stop!\" One of the policemen turned and says, \n\"What do you want?\" I say, \"Bring him to me, I want to look at him.\" They \nbrought him over and I said, \"That person was just in our apartment and he \njust raped me and my sister. I recognize him, note it down.\" They said, \n\"Fine,\" but didn't write it down and led him on. I don't know where they were \ntaking him.\n\nThen they put my stretcher near where the injured and beaten soldiers were \nsitting. They went to look for the ambulance driver so he would bring the car \nup closer. One of the soldiers started talking to me, \"Sister . . . \" I don't \nremember the conversation exactly, but he asked me were we lived and what they\ndid to us. I asked him, \"Where are you from?\" He said that he was from Ufa. \nApparently they were the first that were brought in. The Ufa police. Later I \nlearned that they suffered most of all. He says, \"OK, you're Armenians, they \ndidn't get along with you, but I'm a Russian,\" he says, \"what are they trying \nto kill me for?\" Oh, I remembered something else. When I went out onto the \nbalcony with Kuliyev for a hammer and nails I looked out the window and saw \ntwo Azerbaijanis beating a soldier near the kindergarten. He was pressed \nagainst the fence and he covered his head with his arms, they were beating him\nwith his own club. The way he cried \"Mamma\" made my skin crawl. I don't know \nwhat they did to him, if he's still alive or not. And something else. Before \nhe attack on our house we saw sheets, clothes, and some dishes flying from the\nthird or fourth floor of the neighboring building, but I didn't think it was \nAzerbaijanis attacking Armenians. I thought that something was on fire or they\nwere throwing something they didn't need out, or someone was fighting with \nsomeone. It was only later, when they were burning a passenger car in the \nyard, when the neighbors said that they were doing that to the Armenians, that\nI realized that this was serious, that it was anti-Armenian.\n\nThey took Karina and me to the Sumgait Maternity Home. Mamma went to them too \nand said, \"I've been beaten too, help me.\" But they just ignored her. My \nfather went to them and said in a guilty voice, as though it was his fault \nthat he'd been beaten, and says, \"My ribs hurt so much, those creeps have \nprobably broken my ribs. Please look at them.\" The doctor says, \"That's not my\njob.\" Urshan said, \"Fine, I'll take you to my place and if we need a doctor, \nI'll find you one. I'll bring one and have him look at you. And he drove them \nto his apartment.\n\nMarina and I stayed there. They examined us. I was more struck by what the \ndoctor said than by what those Azerbaijanis in our apartment did to us. I \nwasn't surprised when they beat us they wanted to beat us, but I was very\nsurprised that in a Soviet medical facility a woman who had taken the\nHippocratic Oath could talk to victims like that. By happy--or unhappy--\ncoincidence we were seen by the doctor that had delivered our Karina. And she,\nhaving examined Karina, said, \"No problem, you got off pretty good. Not like \nthey did in Kafan, when you Armenians were killing and raping our women.\n\"Karina was in such terrible condition that she couldn't say anything--she\nwould certainly have had something to say! Then they examined me. The same \nstory. They put us in a separate ward. No shots, no medicinal powders, no \ndrugs. Absolutely none! They didn't even give us tea. All the women there soon\nfound out that in ward such and such were Armenians who had been raped. And\nthey started coming and peering through the keyhole, the way people look at \nzoo animals. Karina didn't see this, she was lying there, and I kept her from \nseeing it.\n\nThey put Ira B. in our ward. She had also been raped. True, she didn't have \nany serious bodily injuries, but when she told me what had happened at their \nplace, I felt worse for them than I did for us. Because when they raped Ira \nher daughter was in the room, she was under the bed on which it happened. And\nIra was holding her daughter's hand, the one who was hiding under the bed.\nWhen they were beating Ira or taking her earrings off, gold, when she \ninvoluntarily let go of her daughter's hand, her daughter took her hand again.\nHer daughter is in the fourth grade, she's 11 years old. I felt really awful \nwhen I heard that. Ira asked them not to harm her daughter, she said, \"Do what\nyou want with me, just leave my daughter alone.\" Well, they did what they \nwanted. They threatened to kill her daughter if she got in their way. Now I \nwould be surprised if the criminals had behaved any other way that night. It \nwas simply Bartholomew's Night, I say, they did what they would love to do \nevery day: steal, kill, rape . . .\n\nMany are surprised that those animals didn't harm the children. The beasts \nexplained it like this: this would be repeated in 15 to 20 years, and those \nchildren would be grown, and then, as they put it, \"we'll come take the \npleasure out of their lives, those children.\" This was about the girls that\nwould be young women in 15 years. They were thinking about their tomorrow \nbecause they were sure that there would be no trial and no investigation, just\nas there was no trial or investigation in 1915, and that those girls could be \nof some use in 15 years. This I heard from the investigators; one of the \nvictims testified to it. That's how they described their own natures, that\nthey would still be bloodthirsty in 15 to 20 years, and in 100 years--they\nthemselves said that.\n\nAnd this, too. Everyone is surprised that they didn't harm our Marina. Many \npeople say that they either were drunk or had smoked too much. I don't know \nwhy their eyes were red. Maybe because they hadn't slept the night before, \nmaybe for some other reason, I don't know. But they hadn't been smoking and \nthey weren't drunk, I'm positive, because someone who has smoked will stop at \nnothing he has the urge to do. And they spoke in a cultured fashion with \nMarina: \"Little sister, don't be afraid, we won't harm you, don't look over \nthere [where I was], you might be frightened. You're a Muslim, a Muslim woman \nshouldn't see such things.\" So they were really quite sober . . .\n\nSo we came out of that story alive. Each every day we have lived since it all \nhappened bears the mark of that day. It wasn't even a day, of those several \nhours. Father still can't look us in the eyes. He still feels guilty for what\nhappened to Karina, Mother, and me. Because of his nerves he's started talk-\ning to himself, I've heard him argue with himself several times when he\nthought no one is listening: \"Listen,\" he'll say, \"what could I do? What could\nI do alone, how could I protect them?\" I don't know where to find the words,\nit's not that I'm happy, but I am glad that he didn't see it all happen. \nThat's the only thing they spared us . . . or maybe it happened by chance. Of \ncourse he knows it all, but there's no way you could imagine every last detail\nof what happened. And there were so many conversations: Karina and I spoke\ntogether in private, and we talked with Mamma, too. But Father was never\npresent at those conversations. We spare him that, if you can say that. And\nwhen the investigator comes to the house, we don't speak with Father present.\n\nOn February 29, the next clay, Karina and I were discharged from the hospital.\nFirst they released me, but since martial law had been declared in the city, \nthe soldiers took me to the police precinct in an armored personnel carrier. \nThere were many people there, Armenian victims. I met the Tovmasian family \nthere. From them I learned that Rafik and their Uncle Grant had died. They \nwere sure that both had died. They were talking to me and Raya, Rafik's wife \nand Grant's daughter, and her mother, were both crying.\n\nThen they took us all out of the office on the first floor into the yard.\nThere's a little one-room house outside there, a recreation and reading area.\nThey took us in there. The women were afraid to go because they thought\nthat they were shooing us out of the police precinct because it had become\nso dangerous that even the people working at the precinct wanted to hide.\nThe women were shouting. They explained to them: \"We want to hide you\nbetter because it's possible there will be an attack on the police precinct.\"\n\nWe went into the little house. There were no chairs or tables in there. We\nhad children with us and they were hungry; we even had infants who needed to \nhave their diapers changed. No one had anything with them. It was just awful. \nThey kept us there for 24 hours. From the window of the one room house you \ncould see that there were Azerbaijanis standing on the fences around the \npolice precinct, as though they were spying on us. The police precinct is \nsurrounded by a wall, like a fence, and it's electrified, but if they were \nstanding on the wall, it means the electricity was shut off. This brought \ngreat psychological pressure to bear on us, particularly on those who hadn't \njust walked out of their apartments, but who hadn't slept for 24 hours, or 48,\nor those who had suffered physically and spiritually, the ones who had lost \nfamily members. For us it was another ordeal. We were especially frightened \nwhen all the precinct employees suddenly disappeared. We couldn't see a single\nperson, not in the courtyard and not in the windows. We thought that they must\nhave already been hiding under the building, that they must have some secret \nroom down there. People were panicking: they started throwing themselves at\none another . . . That's the way it is on a sinking ship. We heard those \npeople, mainly young people, whistling and whopping on the walls. We felt that\nthe end was approaching. I was completely terrified: I had left Karina in the \nhospital and didn't know where my parents were. I was sort of calm about my \nparents, I was thinking only about Karina, if, Heaven forbid, they should \nattack the hospital, they would immediately tell them that there was an \nArmenian in there, and something terrible would happen to Karina again, and \nshe wouldn't be able to take it.\n\nThen soldiers with dogs appeared. When they saw the dogs some of the people \nclimbed down off the fence. Then they brought in about another 30 soldiers.\nThey all had machine guns in readiness, their fingers on the triggers. We \ncalmed down a little. They brought us chairs and brought the children some \nlittle cots and showed us where we could wash our hands, and took the children\nto the toilet. But we all sat there hungry, but to be honest, it would never \nhave occurred to any of us that we hadn't eaten for two days and that people \ndo eat.\n\nThen, closer to nightfall, they brought a group of detained criminals. They \nwere being watched by soldiers with guard dogs. One of the men came back from \nthe courtyard and told us about it. Raya Tovmasian . . . it was like a \ndifferent woman had been substituted. Earlier she had been crying, wailing, \nand calling out: \"Oh, Rafik!,\" but when she heard about this such a rage came \nover her! She jumped up, she had a coat on, and she started to roll up her \nsleeves like she was getting ready to beat someone. And suddenly there were \nsoldiers, and dogs, and lots of people. She ran over to them. The bandits were\nstanding there with their hands above their heads facing the wall. She went up\nto one of them and grabbed him by the collar and started to shake and thrash \nhim! Then, on to a second, and a third. Everyone was rooted to the spot. Not \none of the soldiers moved, no one went up to help or made her stop her from \ndoing it. And the bandits fell down and covered their heads with their hands, \nmuttering something. She came back and sat down, and something akin to a smile\nappeared on her face. She became so quiet: no tears, no cries. Then that round\nwas over and she went back to beat them again. She was walking and cursing \nterribly: take that, and that, they killed my husband, the bastards, the \ncreeps, and so on. Then she came back again and sat down. She probably did \nthis the whole night through, well, it wasn't really night, no one slept. She \nwent five or six times and beat them and returned. And she told the women, \n\"What are you sitting there for? They killed your husbands and children, they \nraped, and you're just sitting there. You're sitting and talking as though \nnothing had happened. Aren't you Armenians?\" She appealed to everyone, but no \none got up. I was just numb, I didn't have the strength to beat anyone, I \ncould barely hold myself up, all the more so since I had been standing for so \nmany hours--I was released at eleven o'clock in the morning and it was already\nafter ten at night because there weren't enough chairs, really it was the \nelderly and women with children who sat. I was on my feet the whole time. \nThere was nothing to breathe, the door was closed, and the men were smoking. \nThe situation was deplorable.\n\nAt eleven o'clock at night policemen came for us, local policemen, \nAzerbaijanis. They said, \"Get up. They've brought mattresses, you can wash up\nand put the children to bed.\" Now the women didn't want to leave this place, \neither. The place had become like home, it was safe, there were soldiers with \ndogs. If anyone went outside, the soldiers would say, \"Oh, it's our little \nfamily,\" and things like that. The soldiers felt this love, and probably, for \nthe first time in their lives perceived themselves as defenders. Everyone\nspoke from the heart, cried, and hugged them and they, with their loaded\nmachine guns in their hands, said, \"Grandmother, you mustn't approach me,\nI'm on guard.\" Our people would say, \"Oh, that's all right.\" They hugged\nthem, one woman even kissed one of the machine guns. This was all terribly\nmoving for me. And the small children kept wanting to pet the dogs.\n\nThey took us up to the second floor and said, \"You can undress and sleep in \nhere. Don't be afraid, the precinct is on guard, and it's quiet in the city.\"\nThis was the 29th, when the killing was going on in block 41A and in other\nplaces. Then we were told that all the Armenians were being gathered at the\nSK club and at the City Party Committee. They took us there. On the way I \nasked them to stop at the Maternity Home: I wanted to take Karina with me.\nI didn't know what was happening there. They told me, \"Don't worry, the\nMaternity Home is full of soldiers, more than mothers-to-be. So you can rest\nassured. I say, \"Well, I won't rest assured regardless, because the staff in\nthere is capable of anything.\"\n\nWhen I arrived at the City Party Committee it turned out that Karina had\nalready been brought there. They had seen fit to release her from the hospi-\ntal, deciding that she felt fine and was no longer in need of any care. Once\nwe were in the City Party Committee we gave free reign to our tears. We met \nacquaintances, but everyone was somehow divided into two groups, those who \nhadn't been injured, who were clothed, who had brought a pot of food with \nthem, and so on, and those, like me, like Raya, who were wearing whatever had \ncome their way. There were even people who were all made up, dolled up like \nthey had come from a wedding. There were people without shoes, naked people, \nhungry people, those who were crying, and those who had lost someone. And of \ncourse the stories and the talk were flying: \"Oh, I heard that they killed \nhim!\" \"What do you mean they killed him!\" \"He stayed at work!\" \"Do you know \nwhat's happening at this and such a plant? Talk like that.\n\nAnd then I met Aleksandr Mikhailovich Gukasian, the teacher. I know him very \nwell and respect him highly. I've known him for a long time. They had a small \nroom, well really it was more like a study-room. We spent a whole night \ntalking in that study once. On March 1 we heard that Bagirov [First Secretary \nof the Communist Party of Azerbaijan SSR] had arrived. Everyone ran to see \nBagirov, what news he had brought with him and how this was all being viewed \nfrom outside. He arrived and everyone went up to him to talk to him and ask \nhim things. Everyone was in a tremendous rage. But he was protected by \nsoldiers, and he went up to the second floor and didn't deign to speak with \nthe people. Apparently he had more important things to do.\n\nSeveral hours passed. Gukasian called me and says, \"Lyudochka, find another \ntwo or three. We're going to make up lists, they asked for them upstairs, \nlists of the dead, those whose whereabouts are unknown, and lists of people \nwho had pogroms of their apartments and of those whose cars were burned.\" I \nhad about 50 people in my list when they called me and said, \"Lyuda, your \nMamma has arrived, she's looking for you, she doesn't believe that you are \nalive and well and that you're here.\" I gave the lists to someone and asked \nthem to continue what I was doing and went off.\n\nThe list was imprecise, of course. It included Grant Adamian, Raya Tovmasian's\nfather, who was alive, but at the time they thought him dead. There was Engels\nGrigorian's father and aunt, Cherkez and Maria. The list also included the \nname of my girlfriend and neighbor, Zhanna Agabekian. One of the guys said \nthat he had been told that they chopped her head off in the courtyard in front\nof the Kosmos movie theater. We put her on the list too, and cried, but later \nit turned out that that was just a rumor, that in fact an hour earlier she had\nsomehow left Sumgait for the marina and from there had set sail for \nKrasnovodsk, where, thank God, she was alive and well. I should also say that \nin addition to those who died that list contained people who were rumored \nmissing or who were so badly wounded that they were given up for dead.                                                                 3\n\nAll the lists were taken to Bagirov. I don't remember how many dead were \ncontained in the list, but it's a fact that when Gukasian came in a couple \nof minutes later he was cursing and was terribly irate. I asked, \"What's \ngoing on?\" He said, \"Lyuda, can you imagine what animals, what scoundrels\nthey are! They say that they lost the list of the dead. Piotr Demichev\n[Member of the Politburo of the Central Committee of the Communist Party\nof the USSR] has just arrived, and we were supposed to submit the list to\nhim, so that he'd see the scope of the slaughter, of the tragedy, whether it\nwas one or fifty.\" They told him that the list had disappeared and they\nshould ask everyone who hadn't left for the Khimik boarding house all over\nagain. There were 26 people on our second list. I think that the number 26\nwas the one that got into the press and onto television and the radio, because\nthat's the list that Demichev got. I remember exactly that there were 26 \npeople on the list, I had even told Aleksandr Mikhailovich that that was only \na half of those that were on the first list. He said, \"Lyuda, please, try to\nremember at least one more.\" But I couldn't remember anyone else. But there\nwere more than 30 dead. Of that I am certain. The government and the Procuracy\ndon't count the people who died of fright, like sick people and old people \nwhose lives are threatened by any shock. They weren't registered as victims of\nthe Sumgait tragedy. And then there may be people we didn't know. So many \npeople left Sumgait between March 1 and 8! Most of them left for smaller towns\nin Russia, and especially to the Northern Caucasus, to Stavropol, and the \nKrasnodarsk Territory. We don't have any information on them. I know that \nthere are people who set out for parts around Moscow. In the periodical \nKrestyanka [Woman Farmer] there was a call for people who know how to milk \ncows, and for mechanics, and drivers, and I know a whole group of people went \nto help out. Also clearly not on our list are those people who died entering\nthe city, who were burned in their cars. No one knows about them, except the \nAzerbaijanis, who are hardly likely to say anything about it. And there's\nmore. A great many of the people who were raped were not included in the list \ndrawn up at the Procuracy. I know of three instances for sure, and I of course\ndon't know them all. I'm thinking of three women whose parents chose not to \npublicize what had happened, that is, they didn't take the matter to court, \nthey simply left. But in so doing they didn't cease being victims. One of them\nis the first cousin of my classmate Kocharian. She lived in Microdistrict No. \n8, on the fifth floor. I can't tell you the building number and I don't know \nher name. Then comes the neighbor of one of my relatives, she lived in \nMicrodistrict 1 near the gift shop. I don't know her name, she lives on the \nsame landing as the Sumgait procurator. They beat her father, he was holding \nthe door while his daughter hid, but he couldn't hold the door forever, and \nwhen she climbed over the balcony to the neighbors' they seized her by her \nbraid. Like the Azerbaijanis were saying, it was a very cultured mob, because \nthey didn't kill anyone, they only raped them and left. And the third one \n. . . I don't remember who the third one was anymore.\n\nThey transferred us on March 1. Karina still wasn't herself. Yes, we lived for\ndays in the SK, in the cultural facility, and at the Khimik. They lived there \nand I lived at the City Party Committee because I couldn't stay with Karina; \nit was too difficult for me, but I was at peace: she had survived. I could \nalready walk, but really it was honest words that held me up. Thanks to the \nsocial work I did there, I managed to persevere. Aleksandr Mikhailovich said, \n\"If it weren't for the work I would go insane.\" He and I put ourselves in gear\nand took everything upon ourselves: someone had an infant and needed diapers \nand free food, and we went to get them. The first days we bought everything, \nalthough we should have received it for free. They were supposed to have been \ndispensed free of charge, and they sold it to us. Then, when we found out it \nwas free, we went to Krayev. At the time, fortunately, you could still drop by\nto see him like a neighbor, all the more so since everything was still clearly\nvisible on our faces. Krayev sent a captain down and he resolved the issue.\n\nOn March 2 they sent two investigators to see us: Andrei Shirokov and Vladimir\nFedorovich Bibishev. The way it worked out, in our family they had considered \nonly Karina and me victims, maybe because she and I wound up in the hospital.\nMother and Father are considered witnesses, but not victims.\n\nShirokov was involved with Karina's case, and Bibishev, with mine. After I \ntold him everything, he and I planned to sit down with the identikit and\nrecord everyone I could remember while everything was still fresh in my mind. \nWe didn't work with the identikit until the very last day because the\nconditions weren't there. The investigative group worked slowly and did poor \nquality work solely because the situation wasn't conducive to working: there \nweren't enough automobiles, especially during the time when there was a \ncurfew, and there were no typewriters for typing transcripts, and no still or \nvideo cameras. I think that this was done on purpose. We're not so poor that \nwe can't supply our investigators with all that stuff. It was done especially \nto draw out the investigation, all the more so since the local authorities saw\nthat the Armenians were leaving at the speed of light, never to return to \nSumgait. And the Armenians had a lot to say I came to an agreement with \nBibishev, I told him myself, \"Don't you worry, if it takes us a month or two \nmonths, I'll be here. I'm not afraid, I looked death in the eyes five times in\nthose two days, I'll help you conduct the investigation.\"\n\nHe and I worked together a great deal, and I used this to shelter Karina, I\ngave them so much to do that for a while they didn't have the time to get to\nher, so that she would at least have a week or two to get back to being her-\nself. She was having difficulty breathing so we looked for a doctor to take x-\nrays. She couldn't eat or drink for nine days, she was nauseous. I didn't eat\nand drank virtually nothing for five days. Then, on the fifth day, when we\nwere in Baku already, the investigator told me, \"How long can you go on like \nthis? Well fine, so you don't want to eat, you don't love yourself, you're\nnot taking care of yourself, but you gave your word that you would see this\ninvestigation through. We need you.\" Then I started eating, because in fact I\nwas exhausted. It wasn't enough that I kept seeing those faces in our apart-\nment in my mind, every day I went to the investigative solitary confinement\ncells and prisons. I don't know . . . we were just everywhere! Probably in\nevery prison in the city of Baku and in all the solitary confinement cells of\nSumgait. At that time they had even turned the drunk tank into solitary \nconfinement.\n\nThus far I have identified 31 of the people who were in our apartment. Mamma \nidentified three, and Karina, two. The total is 36. Marina didn't identify \nanyone, she remembers the faces of two or three, But they weren't among the \nphotographs of those detained. I told of the neighbor I recognized. The one \nwho went after the axe. He still hasn't been detained, he's still on the \nloose. He's gone, and it's not clear if he will be found or not. I don't know \nhis first or last name. I know which building he lived in and I know his \nsisters' faces. But he's not in the city. The investigators informed me that \neven if the investigation is closed and even if the trial is over they will \ncontinue looking for him.\n\nThe 31 people I identified are largely blue-collar workers from various \nplants, without education, and of the very lowest level in every respect.\nMostly their ages range from 20 to 30 years; there was one who was 48. Only\none of them was a student. He was attending the Azerbaijan Petroleum and\nChemical Institute in Sumgait, his mother kept trying to bribe the investiga-\ntor. Once, thinking that I was an employee and not a victim, she said in front\nof me \"I'll set you up a restaurant worth 500 rubles and give you 600 in cash\nsimply for keeping him out of Armenia,\" that is, to keep him from landing in\na prison on Armenian soil. They're all terribly afraid of that, because if the\ninvestigator is talking with a criminal and the criminal doesn't confess even\nthough we identified him, they tell him--in order to apply psychological\npressure--they say, \"Fine, don't confess, just keep silent. When you're in an\nArmenian prison, when they find out who you are, they'll take care of you\nin short order.\" That somehow gets to them. Many give in and start to talk.\n\nThe investigators and I were in our apartment and videotaped the entire\npogrom of our apartment, as an investigative experiment. It was only then\nthat I saw the way they had left our apartment. Even without knowing who was \nin our apartment, you could guess. They stole, for example, all the money and \nall the valuables, but didn't take a single book. They tore them up, burned \nthem, poured water on them, and hacked them with axes. Only the Materials\nfrom the 27th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and James \nFenimore Cooper's Last of the Mohigans. Oh yes, lunch was ready, we were \nboiling a chicken, and there were lemons for tea on the table. After they had \nbeen in our apartment, both the chicken and the lemons were gone. That's \nenough to tell you what kind of people were in our apartment, people who don't\neven know anything about books. They didn't take a single book, but they did \ntake worn clothing, food, and even the cheapest of the cheap, worn-out \nslippers.\n\nOf those whom I identified, four were Kafan Azerbaijanis living in Sumgait. \nBasically, the group that went seeking \"revenge\"--let's use their word for \nit--was joined by people seeking easy gain and thrill-seekers. I talked with \none of them. He had gray eyes, and somehow against the back-drop of all that \nblack I remembered him specifically because of his of his eyes. Besides taking\npart in the pogrom of our apartment, he was also involved in the murder of \nTamara Mekhtiyeva from Building 16. She was an older Armenian who had recently\narrived from Georgia, she lived alone and did not have anyone in Sumgait. I \ndon't know why she had a last name like that, maybe she was married to an \nAzerbaijani. I had laid eyes on this woman only once or twice, and know \nnothing about her. I do know that they murdered her in her apartment with an \naxe. Murdering her wasn't enough for them. They hacked her into pieces and \nthrew them into the tub with water.\n\nI remember another guy really well too, he was also rather fair-skinned. You \nknow, all the people who were in our apartment were darker than dark, both \ntheir hair and their skin. And in contrast with them, in addition to the grey-\neyed one, I remember this one fellow, the one l took to be a Lezgin. I \nidentified him. As it turned out he was Eduard Robertovich Grigorian, born\nin the city of Sumgait, and he had been convicted twice. One of our own. How \ndid I remember him? The name Rita was tattooed on his left or right hand. I \nkept thinking, is that Rita or \"puma,\" which it would be if you read the word \nas Latin characters instead of Cyrillic, because the Cyrillic \"T\" was the one \nthat looks like a Latin \"M.\" When they led him in he sat with his hands behind\nhis back. This was at the confrontation. He swore on every holy book, tried to\nput in an Armenian word here and there to try and spark my compassion, and \ntold me that I was making a mistake, and called me \"dear sister.\" He said, \n\"You're wrong, how could I, an Armenian, raise my hand against my own, an \nArmenian,\" and so on. He spoke so convincingly that even the investigator \nasked me, \"Lyuda, are you sure it was he?\" I told him, \"I'll tell you one more\nidentifying mark. If I'm wrong I shall apologize and say I was mistaken. The \nname Rita is tattooed on his left or right hand.\" He went rigid and became \npale. They told him, \"Put your hands on the table.\" He put his hands on the\ntable with the palms up. I said, \"Now turn your hands over,\" but he didn't \nturn his hands over. Now this infuriated me. If he had from the very start\nacknowledged his guilt and said that he hadn't wanted to do it, that they \nforced him or something else, I would have treated him somewhat differently.\nBut he insolently stuck to his story, \"No, I did not do anything, it wasn't \nme.\" When they turned his hands over the name Rita was in fact tattooed on his\nhand. His face distorted and he whispered something wicked. I immediately flew\ninto a rage. There was an ashtray on the table, a really heavy one, made out \nof granite or something, very large, and it had ashes and butts in it. \nCatching myself quite by surprise, I hurled that ashtray at him. But he ducked\nand the ashtray hit the wall, and ashes and butts rained down on his head and \nback. And he smiled. When he smiled it provoked me further. I don't know how, \nbut I jumped over the table between us and started either pounding him or \nstrangling him; I no longer remember which. When I jumped I caught the \nmicrophone cord. The investigator was there, Tolya . . .I no longer recall his\nlast name, and he says, \"Lyudochka, it's a Japanese microphone! Please . . .\n\" And shut off all the equipment on the spot, it was all being video taped. \nThey took him away. I stayed, and they talked to me a little to calm me down, \nbecause we needed to go on working, I only remember Tolya telling me, \"You're \nsome actress! What a performance!\" I said, \"Tolya, honestly . . . \" Beforehand\nthey would always tell me, \"Lyuda, more emotion. You speak as calmly as if \nnothing had happened to you.\" I say, \"I don't have any more strength or \nemotion. All my emotions are behind me now, I no longer have the strength \n. . . I don't have the strength to do anything.\" And he says, \"Lyuda, how were\nyou able to do that?\" And when I returned to normal, drinking tea and watching\nthe tape, I said, \"Can I really have jumped over that table? I never jumped \nthat high in gym class.\"\n\nSo you could say the gang that took over our apartment was international. Of \nthe 36 we identified there was an Armenian, a Russian, Vadim Vorobyev, who \nbeat Mamma, and 34 Azerbaijanis.\n\nAt the second meeting with Grigorian, when he had completely confessed his \nguilt, he told of how on February 27 the Azerbaijanis had come knocking. Among\nthem were guys--if you can call them guys--he knew from prison. They said, \n\"Tomorrow we're going after the Armenians. Meet us at the bus station at three\no'clock.\" He said, \"No, I'm not coming.\" They told him, \"If you don't come \nwe'll kill you.\" He said, \"Alright, I'll come.\" And he went.\n\nThey also went to visit my classmate from our microdistrict, Kamo Pogosian. He\nhad also been in prison; I think that together they had either stolen a \nmotorcycle or dismantled one to get some parts they needed. They called him \nout of his apartment and told him the same thing: \"Tomorrow we're going to get\nthe Armenians. Be there.\" He said, \"No.\" They pulled a knife on him. He said, \n\"I'm not going all the same.\" And in the courtyard on the 27th they stabbed \nhim several times, in the stomach. He was taken to the hospital. I know he was\nin the hospital in Baku, in the Republic hospital. If we had known about that \nwe would have had some idea of what was to come on the 28th.\n\nI'll return to Grigorian, what he did in our apartment. I remember that he\nbeat me along with all the rest. He spoke Azerbaijani extremely well. But he\nwas very fair-skinned, maybe that led me to think that they had it out for\nhim, too. But later it was proved that he took part in the beating and burning\nof Shagen Sargisian. I don't know if he participated in the rapes in our \napartment; I didn't see, I don't remember. But the people who were in our \napartment who didn't yet know that he was an Armenian said that he did. I \ndon't know if he confessed or not, and I myself don't recall because I blacked\nout very often. But I think that he didn't participate in the rape of Karina\nbecause he was in the apartment the whole time. When they carried her into the\ncourtyard, he remained in the apartment.\n\nAt one point I was talking with an acquaintance about Edik Grigorian. From her\nI learned that his wife was a dressmaker, his mother is Russian, he doesn't \nhave a father, and that he's been convicted twice. Well this will be his third\nand, I hope, last sentence. He beat his wife, she was eternally coming to work\nwith bruises. His wife was an Armenian by the name of Rita.\n\nThe others who were detained . . . well they're little beasts. You really can't\ncall them beasts, they're just little beasts. They were robots carrying out\nsomeone else's will, because at the investigation they all said, \"I don't \nunderstand how I could have done that, I was out of my head.\" But we know that\nthey were won around to it and prepared for it, that's why they did it. In the\nname of Allah, in the name of the Koran, in the name of propagating Islam--\nthat's holy to them--that's why they did everything they were commanded to do.\nBecause I saw they didn't have minds of their own, I'm not talking about their\nlevel of cultural sophistication or any higher values. No education, they\nwork, have a slew of children without the means to raise them properly, they \ncrowd them in, like at the temporary housing, and apparently, they were \npromised that if they slaughtered the Armenians they would receive apartments.\nSo off they went. Many of them explained their participation saying, \"they \npromised us apartments.\"\n\nAmong them was one who genuinely repented. I am sure that he repented from the\nheart and that he just despised himself after the incident. He worked at a \nchildren's home, an Azerbaijani, he has two children, and his wife works at \nthe children's home too. Everything that they acquired, everything that they \nhave they earned by their own labor, and wasn't inherited from parents or \ngrandparents. And he said, \"I didn't need anything I just don't know . . . how\nI ended up in that; it was like some hand was guiding me. I had no will of my \nown, I had no strength, no masculine dignity, nothing.\" And the whole time I\nkept repeating, \"Now you imagine that someone did the same to your young wife \nright before your own eyes.\" He sat there and just wailed.\n\nBut that leader in the Eskimo dogskin coat was not detained. He performed a \nmarvelous disappearing act, but I think that they'll get onto him, they just \nhave to work a little, because that Vadim, that boy, according to his\ngrandfather, is in touch with the young person who taught him what to do, how \nto cover his tracks. He was constantly exchanging jackets with other boys he \nknew and those he didn't, either, and other things as well, and changed \nhimself like a chameleon so they wouldn't get onto him, but he was detained.\n\nThat one in the Eskimo dogskin coat was at the Gambarians' after Aleksandr \nGambarian was murdered. He came in and said, \"Let's go, enough, you've spilled\nenough blood here.\"\n\nMaybe Karina doesn't know this but the reason they didn't finish her off was \nthat they were hoping to take her home with them. I heard this from Aunt Tanya\nand her sons, the Kasumovs, who were in the courtyard near the entryway. They \nliked her very much, and they had decided to take her to home with them. When \nKarina came to at one point--she doesn't remember this yet, this the neighbors \nold me--and she saw that there was no one around her, she started crawling to \nthe entryway. They saw that she was still alive and came back, they were \nalready at the third entryway, on their way to the Gambarians'. They came back\nand started beating her to finish her. If she had not come to she would have \nsustained lesser bodily injuries, they would have beat her less. An older \nwoman from our building, Aunt Nazan, an Azerbaijani, all but lay on top of \nKarina, crying and pleading that they leave her alone, but they flung her off.\nThe woman's grown sons were right nearby; they picked her up in their hands \nand led her home. She howled and cried out loudly and swore: God is on Earth, \nhe sees everything, and He won't forgive this.\n\nThere was another woman, too, Aunt Fatima, a sick, aging woman from the first \nfloor, she's already retired. Mountain dwellers, and Azerbaijanis, too, have a\ncustom: If men are fighting, they throw a scarf under their feet to stop them.\nBut they trampled her scarf and sent her home. To trample a scarf is \ntantamount to trampling a woman's honor.\n\nNow that the investigation is going on, now that a lot is behind us and we \nhave gotten back to being ourselves a little, I think about how could these \nevents that are now called the Sumgait tragedy happen? How did they come \nabout? How did it start? Could it have been avoided? Well, it's clear that \nwithout a signal, without permission from the top leadership, it would not \nhave happened. All the same, I'm not afraid to say this, the Azerbaijanis,\nlet other worthy people take no offense, the better representatives of their \nnations, let them take no offense, but the Azerbaijanis in their majority are \na people who are kept in line only by fear of the law, fear of retribution for\nwhat they have done. And when the law said that they could do all that, like\nunleashed dogs who were afraid they wouldn't have time to do everything, they \nthrew themselves from one thing to the next so as to be able to get more done,\nto snatch a bit more. The smell of the danger was already in the air on\nFebruary 27. You could tell that something was going to happen. And everyone \nwho had figured it out took steps to avoid running into those gangs. Many left\nfor their dachas, got plane tickets for the other end of the country, just got\nas far away as their legs would carry them.\n\nFebruary 27 was a Saturday. I was teaching my third class. The director came \ninto my classroom and said that I should let the children out, that there had \nbeen a call from the City Party Committee asking that all teachers gather for \na meeting at Lenin Square. Well, I excused the children, and there were few \nteachers left at school, altogether three women, the director, and six or \nseven men. The rest had already gone home. We got to Lenin Square and there \nwere a great many people there. This was around five-thirty or six in the \nevening, no later. They were saying all kinds of rubbish up on the podium and \nthe crowd below was supporting them stormily, roaring. They spoke over the \nmicrophone about what had happened in Kafan a few days earlier and that the \ndriver of a bus going to some district had recently thrown a small Azerbaijani\nchild off the bus. The speaker affirmed that he was an eyewitness, that he had\nseen it himself..The crowd started to rage: \"Death to the Armenians! They must\nbe killed!\" Then a woman went up on stage. I didn't see the woman because \npeople were clinging to the podium like flies. I could only hear her. The \nwoman introduced herself as coming from Kafan, and said that the Armenians \ncut her daughters' breasts off, and called, \"Sons, avenge my daughters!\" That \nwas enough. A portion of the people on the square took off running in the \ndirection of the factories, toward the beginning of Lenin Street.\n\nWe stood there about an hour. Then the director of School 25 spoke, he gave a \nvery nationalist speech. He said, \"Brother Muslims, kill the Armenians!\" This \nhe repeated every other sentence. When he said this the crowd supported him \nstormily, whistling and shouting \"Karabagh!\" He said, \"Karabagh has been our \nterritory my whole life long, Karabagh is my soul. How can you tear out my \nheart?\" As though an Azerbaijani would die without Karabagh. \"It's our \nterritory, the Armenians will never see it. The Armenians must be eliminated. \nFrom time immemorial Muslims have cleansed the land of infidel Armenians, from\ntime immemorial, that's the way nature created it, that every 20 to 30 years \nthe Azerbaijanis should cleanse the land of filth.\" By filth he meant \nArmenians.\n\nI heard this. Before that I hadn't been listening to the speeches closely.\nMany people spoke and I stood with my back to the podium, talking shop with \nthe other teachers, and somehow it all went right by, it didn't penetrate,\nthat in fact something serious was taking place. Then, when one of our\nteachers said, \"Listen to what he's saying, listen to what idiocy he's \nspouting,\" we listened. That was the speech of that director. Before that we \nlistened to the woman's speech.\n\nRight then in our group--there were nine of us--the mood changed, and the \nsubject of conversation and all school matters were forgotten. Our director of\nstudies, for whom I had great respect, he's an Azerbaijani . . . Before that I\nhad considered him an upstanding and worthy person, if there was a need to \nobtain leave we had asked him, he seemed like a good person. So he tells me,\n\"Lyuda, you know that besides you there are no Armenians on the square? If \nthey find out that you're an Armenian they'll tear you to pieces. Should I \ntell them you're an Armenian? Should I tell them you're an Armenian?\" When he \nsaid it the first time I pretended not to hear it, and then he asked me a \nsecond time. I turned to the director, Khudurova, and said that it was already\nafter eight, I was expected at home, and I should be leaving. She answered, \n\"No, they said that women should stay here until ten o'clock,.and men, until \ntwelve. Stay here.\" There was a young teacher with us, her children were in \nkindergarten and her husband worked shifts. She asked to leave: \"I left my \nchildren at the kindergarten.\" The director excused her. When she let her go I\nturned around, said, \"Good-bye,\" and left with the young teacher, the \nAzerbaijani. I didn't see them after that.\n\nWhen we were walking the buses weren't running, and a crowd from the rally ran\nnearby us. They had apparently gotten all fired up. It must have become too \nmuch for them, and they wanted to seek vengeance immediately, so they rushed \noff. I wasn't afraid this time because I was sure that the other teacher \nwouldn't say that I was an Armenian.\n\nTo make it short, we reached home. Then Karina told of how they had been at \nthe movies and what had happened there. I started telling of my experience and\nagain my parents didn't understand that we were in danger. We watched \ntelevision as usual, and didn't even imagine that tomorrow would be our last \nday. That's how it all was.\n\nAt the City Party Committee I met an acquaintance, we went to school together,\nZhanna, I don't remember her last name, she lives above the housewares store \non Narimanov Street. She was there with her father, for some reason she \ndoesn't have a mother. The two of them were at home alone. While her father \nheld the door she jumped from the third floor, and she was lucky that the \nground was wet and that there wasn't anyone behind the building when she went \nout on the balcony, there was no one there, they were all standing near the \nentryway. That building was also a lucky one in that there were no murders \nthere. She jumped. She jumped and didn't feel any pain in the heat of the \nmoment. A few days later I found out that she couldn't stand up, she had been \ninjured somehow. That's how people in Sumgait saved their lives, their honor, \nand their children: any way they could. \n\nWhere it was possible, the Armenians fought back. My father's first cousin, \nArmen M., lives in Block 30. They found out by phone from one of the victims \nwhat was going on in town. The Armenians in that building all called one \nanother immediately and all of them armed themselves with axes, knives, even \nwith muskets and went up to the roof. They took their infants with them, and \ntheir old women who had been in bed for God knows how many months, they got \nthem right out of their beds and took everyone upstairs. They hooked \nelectricity up to the trap door to the roof and waited, ready to fight. Then \nthey took the daughter of the school board director hostage, she's an \nAzerbaijani who lived in their building. They called the school board director\nand told her that if she didn't help them, the 17 Armenians on the roof, to \nescape alive and unharmed, she'd never see her daughter again. I'm sure, of \ncourse, that Armenians would never lay a hand on a woman, it was just the only\nthing that could have saved them at the time. She called the police. The \nArmenians made a deal with the local police to go into town. Two armored \npersonnel carriers and soldiers were summoned They surrounded the entryway and\nled everyone down from the roof, and off to the side from the armored \npersonnel carriers was a crowd that was on its way to the building at that \nvery moment, into Block 30. That's how they defended themselves.\n\nI heard that our neighbors, Roman and Sasha Gambarian, resisted. They're big, \nstrong guys. Their father was killed. And I heard that the brothers put up a \nstrong defense and lost their father, but were able to save their mother.\n\nOne of the neighbors told me that after it happened, when they were looking \nfor the criminals on March 1 to 2 and detaining everyone they suspected, \npeople hid people in our entryway, maybe people who were injured or perhaps \ndead. The neighbors themselves were afraid to go there, and when they went \nwith the soldiers into our basement they are supposed to have found \nAzerbaijani corpses. I don't know how many. Even if they had been wounded and \nput down there, after two days they would have died from loss of blood or \ninfection--that basement was filled with water. I heard this from the \nneighbors. And later when I was talking with the investigators the subject \ncame up and they confirmed it. I know, too, that for several hours the \nbasement was used to store objects stolen from our apartment. And our neighbor\ncarried out our carpet, along with the rest: he stole it for himself, posing \nas one of the criminals. Everyone was taking his own share, and the neighbor \ntook his, too, and carried it home. And when we came back, when everything \nseemed to have calmed down, he returned it, saying that it was the only thing \nof ours he had managed to \"save.\"\n\nRaya's husband and father defended themselves. The Trdatovs defended \nthemselves, and so did other Armenian families. To be sure there were\nAzerbaijani victims, although we'll never hear anything about them. For some \nreason our government doesn't want to say that the Armenians were not just \nvictims, but that they defended the honor of their sisters and mothers, too. \nIn the TV show \"Pozitsiya\" [Viewpoint] a military man, an officer, said that \nthe Armenians did virtually nothing to defend themselves. But that's not \nimportant, the truth will come out regardless.\n\nSo that's the price we paid those three days. For three days our courage, our \nbravery, and our humanity was tested. It was those three days, and not the \nyears and dozens of years we had lived before them, that showed what we've \nbecome, what we grew up to be. Those three days showed who was who.\n\nOn that I will conclude my narrative on the Sumgait tragedy. It should be said\nthat it's not over yet, the trials are still ahead of us, and the punishments\nreceived by those who so violated us, who wanted to make us into nonhumans \nwill depend on our position and on the work of the investigators, the \nProcuracy, and literally of every person who lent his hand to the investiga-\ntion. That's the price we paid to live in Armenia, to not fear going out on \nthe street at night, to not be afraid to say we're Armenians, and to not fear\nspeaking our native tongue.\n\n   October 15,1988\n   Yerevan\n\n\t\t\t- - - reference for #008 - - -\n\n[1] _The Sumgait Tragedy; Pogroms against Armenians in Soviet Azerbaijan,\n    Volume I, Eyewitness Accounts_, edited by Samuel Shahmuradian, forward by\n    Yelena Bonner, 1990, published by Aristide D.

Xt Glossary\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\no The Xt Intrinsics implement an object oriented interface to C code\n  to allow useful graphical components to be created.  Included with\n  this are classes that provide the base functionality: Object,\n  RectObj, Core, Composite, Constraint, Shell, OverrideShell, WMShell,\n  etc.  The terms \"Xt\" and \"Intrinsics\" are used interchangeably,\n  however, they are used very precisely to mean a specific library of the X\n  window system.  In particular, it does not include the Athena,\n  Motif, OLIT or any other widget set.  Without further widgets the\n  Intrinsics are not especially useful.\n\no A widget refers to a user interface abstraction created via Xt.  The\n  precise use, is any object that is a subclass of the Core class.  It\n  is used loosely to refer to anything that is a subclass of the\n  Object class although these are more accurately called windowless\n  widgets or gadgets.\n\no Xlib is the C interface to the X11 protocol.  It is one layer below\n  the Xt Intrinsics.  Typically a widget uses relatively few Xlib\n  functions because Xt provides most such services although an\n  understanding of Xlib helps with problems.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n1.

Related FAQ's\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nDavid B. Lewis (uunet!craft!faq) maintains the FAQ on X.  It\nis posted monthly on comp.windows.x and located on export in contrib/FAQ.\n\nLiam R. E. Quin (lee@sq.sq.com) posts an FAQ list on Open Look to \ncomp.windows.x.  \n\nJan Newmarch (jan@pandonia.canberra.edu.au) posts an FAQ list on Motif \nto comp.windows.x.motif.\n\nPeter Ware (ware@cis.ohio-state.edu) posts an FAQ list for\ncomp.windows.x.intrinsics; it is on export in contrib/FAQ-Xt.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n3.  Why does my application core dump when I use signals/alarms/cthreads?\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIn brief, Xlib, Xt and most widget sets have no mutual exclusion for\ncritical sections.  Any interrupt handler is likely to leave one of\nthe above libraries in an inconsistent state -- such as all the\nappropriate flags not yet set, dangling pointers, in the middle of a\nlist traversal, etc.  Note that the ANSI C standard points out that\nbehavior of a signal handler is undefined if the signal handler calls\nany function other than signal() itself, so this is not a problem\nspecific to Xlib and Xt; the POSIX specification mentions other\nfunctions which may be called safely but it may not be assumed that\nthese functions are called by Xlib or Xt functions.\n\nThe only safe way to deal with signals is to set a flag in the\ninterrupt handler.  This flag later needs to be checked either by a\nwork procedure or a timeout callback.  It is incorrect to add either\nof these in the interrupt handler.  As another note, it is dangerous\nto add a work procedure that never finishes.  This effectively\npreempts any work procedures previously added and so they will never\nbe called.  Another option is to open a pipe, tell the event loop\nabout the read end using XtAppAddInput() and then the signal handler\ncan write a byte to the write end of the pipe for each signal.\nHowever, this could deadlock your process if the pipe fills up.\n\nWhy don't the Intrinsics deal with this problem?  Primarily because it\nis supposed to be a portable layer to any hardware and operating\nsystem.   Is that a good enough reason -- I don't think so.\n\n        Note: the article in The X Journal 1:4 and the example in O'Reilly\nVolume 6 are in error.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n4.  How do I use a different visual than the default?\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThis requires a more complicated answer than it should.  A window has\nthree things that are visual specific -- the visual, colormap and\nborder pixmap.  All widgets have their own Colormap and BorderPixmap\nresource; only shell widgets have Visual resources (another questions\ndeals with why shells have a Visual).  The default value of these\nresources is CopyFromParent which does exactly what it says.  In the\nshell widget CopyFromParent gets evalulated as DefaultVisualOfScreen\nand DefaultColormapOfScreen.  When any one of the three resources is\nnot properly set, a BadMatch error occurs when the window is\ncreated.  They are not properly set because each of the values depends\non the visual being used.  \n\nHow to get this to work?  There are two parts to the answer.  The\nfirst is if you want an application to start with a particular visual\nand the second is if you want a particular shell within an application\nto start with a different visual.  The second is actually easier\nbecause the basic information you need is available.

Which visual should an application use?\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThis is a point that can be argued about but one opinion is there is\nno way for an application to know the appropriate visual -- it has to\nbe specified by the user.  If you disagree with this then your\napplication probably falls into the category of always using the\ndefault visual or it is hardware specific and expects some particular\nvisual such as 24bit TrueColor with an OverlayPlane extension (or some\nsuch).\n\nWhy?  No application runs in isolation.  Depending on the way a server\nallocates resources I may not always want your application to run in\nTrueColor mode if it is going to mess up my other applications.  I may\nbe very upset if it chooses to run in GreyScale instead of PsuedoColor\nor just monochrome.\n\nAs an example, on a low end color Sun server there are many different\npossible visuals: monochrome, 256 entry colormap, static gray, static\ncolor, and a 3/3/2 TrueColor.  The SGI Iris's offer all the above \nplus 12 bit TrueColor, 24 bit TrueColor, an Overlay Plane.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n6.  Why do only Shell widgets have a Visual?\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThis is strictly by convention.  It makes it possible for an arbitrary\nwidget to know that the visual it uses can be found by looking for the\nshell widget that is its ancestor and obtaining the visual of that\nshell.\n\nA widget can have its own visual resource.  If it does, it must have\nits own realize method to use the visual when it calls\nXCreateWindow().  You should also make this a resource that can be\nobtained with XtGetValues() so other widgets can find it.  A\nreasonable value is probably XtNvisual.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n7.  Which visual, depth and colormap do Shells inherit?\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe default value for these resources are set to CopyFromParent.  This\nis interpreted as the DefaultColormapOfScreen(), DefaultDepthOfScreen()\nand the default visual of the screen if the widget has no parent -- i.e.\nit is an applicationShellWidgetClass and the root of your widget tree.\n\nIf the parent of the widget is not null, then the shell copies\ncolormap and depth from its parent and uses CopyFromParent as the\nvisual.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n8.  I've done all the above and I still get a BadMatch error.  Why?\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSome resource converters improperly cache references.  This was\nespecially true of X11R3 and earlier versions of Motif.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n9.  Why doesn't my widget get destroyed when I call XtDestroyWidget()?\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSee section 2.8 of the Xt specification.\n\nIt eventually does get destroyed, just not immediately.  The\nIntrinsics destroy a widget in a two-phase process.  First it and all\nof its children have a flag set that indicate it is being destroyed.\nIt is then put on a list of widgets to be destroyed.  This way any\npending X events or further references to that widget can be cleaned\nup before the memory is actually freed.  The second phase is then\nperformed after all callbacks, event handlers, and actions have\ncompleted, before checking for the next X event.  At this point the\nlist is traversed and each widget's memory is actually free()'d, among\nother things.\n\nAs some further caveats/trivia, the widgets may be destroyed if the\nIntrinsics determine that they have no further references to the\nwidgets on the list.  If so, then the phase 2 destruction occurs\nimmediately.  Also, if nested event loops are used, widgets placed on\nthe destroy list before entering the inner event loop are not\ndestroyed until returning to the outer event loop.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n10. How do I exit but still execute the DestroyCallbacks?\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe problem is if a simple and entirely reasonable approach to exiting\nan application is used, such as calling exit() directly, then a widget\nmay not have a chance to clean up any external state -- such as open\nsockets, temporary files, allocated X resources, etc.  (this code for\nsimplicity reasons assumes only a single toplevel widget):\n\n\n\tWidget\n\tToplevelGet (gw)\n\t\tWidget\t\tgw;\t\t/* widget to find toplevel */\n\t{\n\t\tWidget\t\ttop;\n\n\t\tfor (top = gw; XtParent (top); top = XtParent (top))\n\t\t\t/* empty */;\n\t\treturn (top);\n\t}\n\n\tvoid\n\tExitCallback (gw, closure, call_data)\n\t\tWidget\t\tgw;\t\t/* widget */\n\t\tXtPointer\tclosure;\t/* data the app specified */\n\t\tXtPointer\tcall_data;\t/* widget specific data */\n\t{\n\t\tWidget\t\ttoplevel;\n\n\t\ttoplevel = ToplevelGet (gw);\n\t\tXtUnmapWidget (toplevel);\t/* make it disappear quickly */\n\t\tXtDestroyWidget (toplevel);\n\t\texit (0);\n\t}\n\nOne can see that the above code exit's immediately after destroying\nthe toplevel widget.  The trouble is the phase 2 destruction may never\noccur.  \n\nThis works for most widgets and most applications but will not work\nfor those widgets that have any external state.  You might think that\nsince it works now it will always work but remember that part of the\nreason an object oriented approach is used is so one can be ignorant\nof the implementation details for each widget.  Which means that the\nwidget may change and someday require that some external state is\ncleaned up by the Destroy callbacks.\n\nOne alternative is to modify ExitCallback() to set a global flag and\nthen test for that flag in a private event loop.  However, private\nevent loops are frowned upon because it tends to encourage sloppy, and\ndifficult to maintain practices.\n\nTry the following code instead.\n\n\t#include <X11/Intrinsic.h>\n\n\textern Widget ToplevelGet (\n\t#if NeedFunctionPrototypes\n\t\tWidget\t\tgw\n\t#endif\n\t);\n\n\textern Boolean ExitWorkProc (\n\t#if NeedFunctionPrototypes\n\t\tXtPointer\tclosure\n\t#endif\n\t);\n\n\textern void ExitCallback (\n\t#if NeedFunctionPrototypes\n\t\tWidget\t\tgw,\n\t\tXtPointer\tclosure,\n\t\tXtPointer\tcall_data\n\t#endif\n\t);\n\n\tWidget\n\tToplevelGet (gw)\n\tWidget\t\tgw;\t\t/* widget to find toplevel */\n\t{\n\t\tWidget\t\ttop;\n\n\t\tfor (top = gw; XtParent (top); top = XtParent (top))\n\t\t\t/* empty */;\n\t\treturn (top);\n\t}\n\n\n\tvoid\n\tExitCallback (gw, closure, call_data)\n\tWidget\t\tgw;\t\t/* widget */\n\tXtPointer\tclosure;\t/* data the app specified */\n\tXtPointer\tcall_data;\t/* widget specific data */\n\t{\n\t\tWidget\t\ttoplevel;\n\n\t\ttoplevel = ToplevelGet (gw);\n\t\tXtUnmapWidget (toplevel);\t/* make it disappear quickly */\n\t\tXtDestroyWidget (toplevel);\n\t\tXtAppAddWorkProc (XtWidgetToApplicationContext (gw),\n\t\t\t\t  ExitWorkProc, (XtPointer) NULL);\n\t}\n\n\tBoolean\n\tExitWorkProc (closure)\n\t\tXtPointer\tclosure;\n\t{\n\t\texit (0);\n\t\t/*NOTREACHED*/\n\t}\n\n\nExitCallback() adds a work procedure that will get called when the\napplication is next idle -- which happens after all the events are\nprocessed and the destroy callbacks are executed.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n11. How do I resize a Shell widget?\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAfter it is realized, one doesn't resize a Shell widget.  The proper\nthing is to resize the currently managed child of the Shell widget\nusing XtSetValues().  The geometry change is then propagated to the\nShell which asks the window manager which may or may not allow the\nrequest.  However, the Shell must have the resource\nXtNallowShellResize set to True otherwise it will not even ask the\nwindow manager to grant the request and the Shell will not resize.\n\nTo change the position of a Shell, use XtSetValues() on the Shell, not\nthe child, and within the limits of the window manager it should be granted.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n12. Why can't XtAppAddInput() handle files?\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIt does, however Unix semantics for when I/O is ready for a file does\nnot fit most peoples' intuitive model.  In Unix terms a file\ndescriptor is ready for reading whenever the read() call would not\nblock, ignoring the setting of optional flags that indicate not to\nblock.  This works as expected for terminals, sockets and pipes.  For\na file the read() will always return but the return indicates an EOF\n-- i.e. no more data.  The result is the code in the Intrinsics always\ncalls the input handler because it always thinks something is about to\nbe read.  The culprit is the select() system call or on SYSV based\nOS's it is the poll() system call.\n\nHow to get around this on a Unix system?  The best approach is to use\nanother process to check for available input on the file.  Use a pipe\nto connect the application with this other process and pass the file\ndescriptor from the pipe to XtAppAddInput().  A suitable program on\nBSD systems is \"tail -f filename\".\n\nIt's rumored that select() on some systems is not _completely_\nreliable.  In particular:\n\n\t- IBM AIX 3.1: this is one where it would work for a while\n\t  (several thousand times) and then stop until some other\n\t  event woke it up. This seemed to be the result of a race\n\t  condition in the Kernel.  IBM claims to have a fix for this.\n\n\t- Pyramid, doesn't work at all.\n\n\t- Ultrix (and possibly others where pipes are implemented as\n\t  sockets), wasn't completely broken, but although the writing\n\t  side wrote in 512 byte blocks the reading side received it\n\t  all broken up as if it was being put into the pipe a byte at\n\t  a time.  You can waste a lot of time by reading small blocks\n\t  (get raound it by detecting the situation and having\n\t  select() ignore the pipe for 10 mseconds - by then it had\n\t  been given the whole block).\n\n\nNote that all the above descriptions used Unix terminology such as\nread(), file descriptor, pipes, etc.  This is an OS dependent area and\nmay not be identical on all systems.  However the Intrinsic designers\nfelt it was a common enough operation that it should be included with\npart of the toolkit.  Why they didn't also deal with signals at this\npoint I don't know.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n13. What good books and magazines are there on Xt?\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nI have a favorite that is the definitive reference.  To my perspective\nit offers a reasonable introduction but also goes into the full\ndetails of the Intrinsics.  When I started using it I was already\nfamiliar with Xt and the concepts behind it, so newcomers may or may\nnot find it useful.  I've always found it accurate and complete, which\nmeans its a 1000 pages.\n\nAsente, Paul J., and Swick, Ralph R., \"X Window System Toolkit, The\n\tComplete Programmer's Guide and Specification\", Digital Press,\n\t1990, ISBN 1-55558-051-3, order number EY-E757E-DP; and by\n\tPrentice-Hall, ISBN 0-13-972191-6. Also available through DEC\n\tDirect at 1-800-DIGITAL.\n\nThe other book I commonly recomend to novices is:\n\nYoung, Doug. \"The X Window System: Applications and Programming with\n\tXt (Motif Version),\" Prentice Hall, 1989 (ISBN 0-13-497074-8).\n\t(ISBN 0-13-972167-3)\n\nAnd of course O'Reilly has an entire series of manuals on X and Xt.\nO'Reilly ordering is 800-998-9938.  In particular, Volume 5 is an Xt\nreference done in manual page style.  The 3rd edition is extensively\noverhauled and goes far beyond the MIT manual pages.  I'm finding it\nvery useful.  In particular, the permutted index and references to\nother manual pages help a great deal in chasing down related\ninformation.\n\nI read two periodicals, \"The X Resource\" and the \"The X Journal\".\nThese are the only two dealing specifically with X.  \"The X Resource\"\nis published quarterly, by O'Reilly, with one of the issues being the\nMIT X Consortium Technical Conference Proceedings.  There is no\nadvertising.  I've found it informative with pretty good depth.  For\norders, call 1-800-998-9938, or email cathyr@ora.com.  For editorial\nmatters, email adrian@ora.com.  Table of contents are posted at\nmath.utah.edu in ~ftp/pub/tex/bib in TeX form and on ftp.uu.net in\n~ftp/published/oreilly/xresource in ASCII form.\n\n\n\"The X Journal\" is a bimonthly trade rag with lots of advertising.\nThe articles are informative and oriented toward a less technical\naudience.  I read it more to see what's going on then with an\nexpectation of learning a great deal (but remember, I represent a\nfairly small percentage of people).  Also, they have a pretty good\ncollection of people on the advisory board and as columnists.  Call\n(908) 563-9033.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n14. What Widgets are available?\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThere are three popular widget sets:\n\nAthena\t- The set provided with X11.  This is sufficient for most\n\t  purposes but is on the ugly side.  Recently, a 3d look is\n\t  available for ftp on export.lcs.mit.edu:/contrib/Xaw3d.tar.Z.\nMotif\t- From OSF available for a license fee and commonly shipped on\n\t  many workstation vendors platforms (almost everyone but\n\t  Sun).  It looks good and works well but personally I think\n\t  it is poorly implemented.\nOLIT\t- The Open Look Intrinsics Toolkit is a set of widgets\n\t  implementing Sun's Open Look specification.  Developed by\n\t  AT&T.  I've never used it so can't comment on its quality.\n\t  I've heard rumours that it is a pain to actually get.\n\nIn addition the following collection of widgets are also available:\n\nXtra\t- a library of widgets for sale from Graphical Software\n\t  Technology (310-328-9338).  It includes bar graph, stacked\n\t  bar graph, line graph, pie chart, xy plot, hypertext, help,\n\t  spreadsheet, and data entry form widgets.  I've never seen\n\t  them so I can't comment.\nFWF\t- The Free Widget Foundation is attempting to collect a set of\n\t  freely available widgets.  Included are a Pixmap editor,\n\t  FileDialog, and a few others.  The current set of widgets\n\t  can be obtained via anonymous ftp from the machine\n\t  a.cs.uiuc.edu (128.174.252.1) in the file pub/fwf.shar.Z.\nXcu\t- The Cornell University widgets from Gene Dykes.  One of the\n\t  early widget sets released.  Provides a nice appearance for\n\t  buttons and has a mini command language.  Probably not so\n\t  widely used.\nXs\t- The Sony widget set.  This was around during R3 days but\n\t  seemed to disappear.  It looked like it had promise.\nXw\t- The HP widgets.  The precursor to Motif.  Originally written\n\t  for R3 there exists diffs to get it to work under R4 & R5.\n\t  Again, a pretty good widget set but has more or less died.\n\t  The precursor to this was the Xray toolkit which was\n\t  originally implemented for X10R4 and apparently provided\n\t  much experience for the designers of Xt.\nXo\t- A widget set I'm working on.  It's still primitive but you\n\t  can give it a try in archive.cis.ohio-state.edu:pub/Xo/*\n\nThe following specialized widgets are also available:\n\nTbl\t- Implements a tabular layout of widgets.  Supports Motif\n\t  widgets as children.  Part of Wcl.\nPlots\t- The Athena Plotting widgets (not the Athena widgets).\n\t  Contact gnb@bby.oz.au or joe@Athena.MIT.EDU.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n15. What alternatives to the Intrinsics are there?\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\t__________________________________________\n\tName\t\tLanguage\tVendor\n\t__________________________________________\n\tXview\t\tC\t\tSun\n\tOI\t\tC++\t\tParcPlace\n\tInterviews\tC++\t\tStanford\n\tTcl/tk\t\tC\t\tsprite.berkeley.edu\n\t__________________________________________\n\n\nHowever much I like C and admire the skill in both designing and\nimplementing the Intrinsics, hopefully some alternative will develop\nin the next 3-5 years that uses an object oriented language.  Keep\nyour eyes open and expect some change about the same time a language\nother than C _starts_ gaining acceptance.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n16. How do I pass a float value to XtSetValues?\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFirst, what is going wrong is the structure for an Arg is (essentially)\n\ttypdef struct\n\t{\t\n\t    String\tname;\n\t    long\tvalue;\n\t} Arg;\n\nand the code:\n\tArg\targ;\n\n\tXtSetArg (arg, \"name\", 3.2)\n\nexpands to\n\tArg\targ;\n\n\targ.name = \"name\";\n\targ.value = 3.2;\n\nyou can see that with normal C type conversions, the arg.value\ngets the integer \"3\" instead of the floating point value \"3.2\".  When\nthe value is copied into the widget resource, the bit pattern is\nwildly different than that required for a floating point value.  So,\nhow to get around this?\n\nThe following macro is from the Athena widgets document and I am now\nrecomending it over the previous suggestions.\n\n#define XtSetFloatArg(arg, n, d) \\\n    if (sizeof(float) > sizeof(XtArgVal)) { \\\n        XtSetArg(arg, n, &(d)); \\\n    } else { \\\n        XtArgVal *ld = (XtArgVal *)&(d); \\\n        XtSetArg(arg, n, *ld); \\\n    }\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n17. How do I write a resource converter?\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nCourtesy of Rich Thomson (rthomson@dsd.es.com):\n\nThe following discussion of resource converters assumes R4 (or R5)\nIntrinsics.  Resource converters changed between R3 and R4 to allow\nfor destructors and caching of converted values.\n\nThere are several main types of resource converters:\n\n    string to data type\n    data type to string\n    data type to data type\n\ni) string to data type\n    Usually a string to data type converter has a fixed set of strings\n    that will be converted to data type values.  This is most often\n    used to map enumerated names to enumerated values:\n\n\tName\t\tValue\n\t\"True\"\t\t1\n\t\"False\"\t\t0\n\n    In this case, the string to data type converter needs to compare\n    the resource value to the list of fixed strings.  This is most\n    readily accomplished by the use of the \"quark\" mechanism of the\n    resource manager.  The resource value is turned into a quark,\n    which is a unique representation of the string that fits into a\n    single word.  Then the resource quark is compared against the\n    quarks for the fixed strings representing the enumerated values.\n\n    If there are many enumerated strings in the converter (or many\n    converters, each with a small number of enumeration strings), then\n    a global initialization routine might be used to turn all the\n    resource strings into quarks.  That way, the first time one of\n    these converters is used, the strings will be turned into quarks\n    and held in static variables for use in the next invocation of one\n    of the converters.\n\nii) data type to string\n    This type of converter is slightly easier than the string to data\n    type converters since the use of quarks isn't necessary.  Instead,\n    the data type value is simply converted to a string value,\n    probably by the use of sprintf.\n\n    Data type to string converters are useful for applications that\n    wish to convert an internal data type value into a string so that\n    they can write out a valid resource specification to a file.  This\n    mechanism can be used to provide a \"snapshot\" of application state\n    into a file.  This snapshot can be used to restore the program to\n    a known state via the usual X resource database mechanisms.\n\n    If you are taking the trouble to write a string to data type\n    converter, it isn't much extra effort to write the data type to\n    string converter.  Writing both at the same time helps to ensure\n    that they are consistent.\n\niii) data type to data type\n    This type of converter is used to convert an existing data type\n    value to another data type.  For instance, an X pixel value can be\n    converted to an RGB data type that contains separate fields for\n    red, green and blue.\n\n\nThe type signature for a resource converter is as follows:\n\ntypedef Boolean (*XtTypeConverter)(Display *, XrmValuePtr, Cardinal *,\n\tXrmValuePtr, XrmValuePtr, XtPointer *);\n    Display *dpy;\n    XrmValuePtr args;\n    Cardinal *num_args;\n    XrmValuePtr fromVal;\n    XrmValuePtr toVal;\n    XtPointer *converter_data;\n\nWhen the converter is invoked, the \"fromVal\" argument points to the source\nX resource manager value and the \"toVal\" argument points to the\ndestination X resource manager value.  The \"converter_data\" argument\nis an opaque pointer to some converter-specific data that is specified\nwhen the converter is registered.  The \"args\" and \"num_args\" arguments\nallow extra information to be passed to the converter when it is\ninvoked.  For instance, the Pixel to RGB structure converter discussed\nabove would need colormap and visual arguments in which to lookup the\nPixel to obtain the RGB values corresponding to that pixel.\n\nCare must be taken with the \"toVal\" argument.  An XrmValue has the\nfollowing type definition and specifies a size and location for a\nconverted value:\n\ntypedef struct {\n    unsigned int    size;\n    caddr_t         addr;\n} XrmValue, *XrmValuePtr;\n\nWhen the converter is invoked, the address may point to a location of\nthe given size for the converted value or the location can be NULL.\nIn the former case, the converter should ensure that the size of the\ndestination area is large enough to handle the converted value.  If\nthe destination area is not large enough, then the converter should\nset the size to the amount of space needed and return False.  The\ncaller can then ensure that enough space is allocated and reinvoke the\nconverter.  If the size is large enough, then the converter can simply\ncopy the converted value into the space given and return True.\n\nIf the location is NULL, then the converter can assign the location to\nthe address of a static variable containing the converted value and\nreturn True.\n\nWhen writing a group of converters, this code is often repeated and it\nbecomes convenient to define a macro:\n\n    #define DONE(var, type) \\\n      if (toVal->addr) \\\n\t{ \\\n\t  if (toVal->size < sizeof(type)) \\\n\t    { \\\n\t      toVal->size = sizeof(type); \\\n\t      return False; \\\n\t    } \\\n\t  else \\\n\t    *((type *) toVal->addr) = var; \\\n\t} \\\n      else \\\n\ttoVal->addr = (caddr_t) &var; \\\n      toVal->size = sizeof(type); \\\n      return True;\n\n    #define DONESTR(str) \\\n      if (toVal->addr && toVal->size < sizeof(String)) \\\n\t{ \\\n\t  toVal->size = sizeof(String); \\\n\t  return False; \\\n\t} \\\n      else \\\n\ttoVal->addr = (caddr_t) str; \\\n      toVal->size = sizeof(String); \\\n      return True;\n\nInside the converter, it is a good idea to perform a little safety\nchecking on the \"num_args\" and \"args\" arguments to ensure that your\nconverter is being called properly.\n\nOnce you have written your converter, you need to register it with the\nIntrinsics.  The Intrinsics invokes resource converters when creating\nwidgets and fetching their resource values from the resource database.\n\nTo register a converter with a single application context, use\nXtAppSetTypeConverter:\n\nvoid XtAppSetTypeConverter(context, from, to, converter, args, num_args,\n\tcache, destructor)\n    XtAppContext context;\n    String from;\n    String to;\n    XtTypeConverter converter;\n    XtConvertArgList args;\n    Cardinal num_args;\n    XtCacheType cache;\n    XtDestructor destructor;\n\nTo register a converter with all application contexts, use\nXtSetTypeConverter:\n\nvoid XtSetTypeConverter(from, to, converter, args, num_args,\n\tcache, destructor)\n    String from;\n    String to;\n    XtTypeConverter converter;\n    XtConvertArgList args;\n    Cardinal num_args;\n    XtCacheType cache;\n    XtDestructor destructor;\n\nIn the R3 Intrinsics, there were the routines XtAppAddConverter and\nXtAddConverter; these have been superseded by XtAppSetTypeConverter\nand XtSetTypeConverter.  Whenever possible, the newer routines should be\nused.\n\nWhen a converter is registered with the Intrinsics, a \"cache\" argument\nspecifies how converted resource values are to be cached:\n\n    XtCacheNone\t\tDon't cache any converted values\n    XtCacheAll\t\tCache all converted values\n    XtCacheByDisplay\tCache converted values on a per display basis\n\nCaching converted values that require a round-trip to the server is a\ngood idea (for instance string to Pixel conversions).\n\nThe \"destructor\" argument is a routine that is invoked then the\nresource is destroyed, either because its cached reference count has\nbeen decremented to zero or because the widget owning the value is\nbeing destroyed.  XtDestructor has the following type definition:\n\ntypedef void (*XtDestructor)(XtAppContext, XrmValuePtr, XtPointer,\n\tXrmValuePtr, Cardinal *);\n    XtAppContext context;\n    XrmValuePtr to;\n    XtPointer converter_data;\n    XrmValuePtr args;\n    Cardinal *num_args;\n\nThe destructor is invoked to free any auxiliary storage associated\nwith the \"to\" argument, but does not actually free the storage pointed\nto by the \"to\" argument itself (to->addr).  The destructor is passed\nthe extra arguments that were passed to the converter when the\nconversion was performed (for instance, colormap and visual arguments\nfor the string to Pixel converter since the destructor would need to\nfree the allocated Pixel from the colormap) as well as the private\ndata passed in when the converter was registered.\n\nSample converter code can be found in the following files in the MIT\nR5 distribution:\n\n    mit/lib/Xt/Converters.c\n    contrib/lib/PEXt/Converters.c\n    contrib/lib/PEXt/Converters.h\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n18. How do I open multiple displays?\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSee \"Multi-user Application Software Using Xt\", The X Resource, Issue 3,\n(Summer 1992) by Oliver Jones for a complete coverage of the issues\ninvolved.  Most of this answer is based on that article.  In a\nnutshell, one uses XtOpenDisplay() to add each display to a _single_\napplication context and then XtCloseDisplay() to shutdown each display\nand remove it from the application context.\n\nThe real problems occur when trying to close down a display.  This can\nhappen 3 ways:\n\t1. User selects a \"quit\" button on one of the displays,\n\t2. User has window manager send a WM_DELETE_WINDOW message,\n\t3. Server disconnect -- possibly from a KillClient message,\n\t   server shutdown/crash, or network failure.\n\nI'll assume you can deal gracefully with 1 & 2 since it is _merely_ a\nproblem of translating a Widget to a display and removing that\ndisplay.  If not, then read the Oliver Jones article.\n\nThe third one is difficult to handle.  The following is based on the\nOliver Jones article and I include it here because it is a difficult\nproblem.\n\nThe difficulty arises because the Xlib design presumed that an I/O\nerror is always unrecoverable and so fatal.  This is essentially true\nfor a single display X based application, but not true for a\nmultiple display program or an application that does things other than\ndisplay information on an X server.  When an X I/O error occurs the\nI/O error handler is called and _if_ it returns then an exit()\nhappens.  The only way around this is to use setjmp/longjmp to avoid\nreturning to the I/O error handler.  The following code fragment\ndemonstrates this:\n\n#include <setjmp.h>\njmp_buf XIOrecover;\n\nvoid\nXIOHandler (dpy)\n\tDisplay\t\t*dpy;\n{\n\tdestroyDisplay (dpy);\n\tlongjmp (XIOrecover, 1);\n}\n\nmain ()\n{\n\t...\n\tif (setjmp (XIOrecover) == 0)\n\t\tXSetIOErrorHandler (XIOHandler);\n\tXtAppMainLoop (app_context);\n}\n\nThe destroyDisplay() is something that given a Display pointer can go\nback to the application specific data and perform any necessary\ncleanup.  It should also call XtCloseDisplay().\n\nFor those of you unfamiliar with setjmp/longjmp, when setjmp() is\nfirst called it returns a 0 and save's enough information in the\njmp_buf that a latter execution of longjmp() can return the program to\nthe same state as if the setjmp() was just executed.  The return value\nof this second setjmp() is the value of the second argument to\nlongjmp().  There are several caveats about using these but for this\npurpose it is adequate.\n\nSome other problems you might run into are resource converters that\nimproperly cache resources.  The most likely symptoms are Xlib errors\nsuch as BadColor, BadAtom, or BadFont.  There may be problems with the\ntotal number of displays you can open since typically only a limited\nnumber of file descriptors are available with 32 being a typical\nvalue.  You may also run into authorization problems when trying to\nconnect to a display.\n\nThere was much discussion in comp.windows.x about this topic in\nNovember of 91.  Robert Scheifler posted an article which basically\nsaid this is the way it will be and Xlib will not change.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n19.

Where are the resources loaded from?\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe resources of a widget are filled in from the following places\n(from highest priority to lowest priority):\n\n\t1. Args passed at creation time.\n\t2. Command line arguments.\n\t3. User's per host defaults file\n\t4. User's defaults file.\n\t5. User's per application default file.\n\t6. System wide per application default file.\n\nNote that 2-6 are read only once on application startup.  The result\nof steps 3-6 is a single resource database used for further queries.\n\nThe per host defaults file contains customizations for all\napplications executing on a specific computer.  This file is either\nspecified with the XENVIRONMENT environment variable or if that is not\nset then the file $HOME/.Xdefaults-<host> is used.\n\nThe user defaults file is either obtained from the RESOURCE_MANAGER\nproperty on the root window of the display or if that is not set then\nthe file $HOME/.Xdefaults is used.  Typically, the program \"xrdb\" is\nused to set the RESOURCE_MANAGER property.  Please note that this\nshould be kept relatively small as each client that connects to the\ndisplay must transfer the property.  A size of around 1-3KByte is\nreasonable.  Some toolkits may track changes to the RESOURCE_MANAGER\nbut most do not.\n\nA user may have many per application default files containing\ncustomizations specific to each application.  The intrinsics are quite\nflexible on how this file is found.  Read the next part that describes\nthe various environment variables and how they effect where this file\nis found.\n\nThe system wide per application default files are typically found in\n/usr/lib/X11/app-defaults.  If such a file is not found then the\nfallback resources are used.  The intrinsics are quite flexible on how\nthis file is found.  Read the next part that describes the various\nenvironment variables and how they effect where this file is found.\n\n[Thanks to Oliver Jones (oj@pictel.com) for the following, 6/92]\n\nYou can use several environment variables to control how resources are\nloaded for your Xt-based programs -- XFILESEARCHPATH,\nXUSERFILESEARCHPATH, and XAPPLRESDIR.  These environment variables\ncontrol where Xt looks for application-defaults files as an\napplication is initializing.  Xt loads at most one app-defaults file\nfrom the path defined in XFILESEARCHPATH and another from the path\ndefined in XUSERFILESEARCHPATH.\n\nSet XFILESEARCHPATH if software is installed on your system in such a\nway that app-defaults files appear in several different directory\nhierarchies.  Suppose, for example, that you are running Sun's Open\nWindows, and you also have some R4 X applications installed in\n/usr/lib/X11/app-defaults. You could set a value like this for\nXFILESEARCHPATH, and it would cause Xt to look up app-defaults files\nin both /usr/lib/X11 and /usr/openwin/lib (or wherever your\nOPENWINHOME is located):\n\n\tsetenv XFILESEARCHPATH /usr/lib/X11/%T/%N:$OPENWINHOME/lib/%T/%N\n\nThe value of this environment variable is a colon-separated list of\npathnames.  The pathnames contain replacement characters as follows\n(see XtResolvePathname()):\n\n\t%N\tThe value of the filename parameter, or the\n\t\tapplication's class name.\n\t%T\tThe value of the file \"type\".  In this case, the\n\t\tliteral string \"app-defaults\"\n\t%C\tcustomization resource (R5 only)\n\t%S\tSuffix.  None for app-defaults.\n\t%L\tLanguage, locale, and codeset (e.g. \"ja_JP.EUC\")\n\t%l\tLanguage part of %L  (e.g. \"ja\")\n\t%t\tThe territory part of the display's language string\n\t%c\tThe codeset part of the display's language string\n\nLet's take apart the example.  Suppose the application's class name is\n\"Myterm\". Also, suppose Open Windows is installed in /usr/openwin.\n(Notice the example omits locale-specific lookup.)\n\n\t/usr/lib/X11/%T/%N        means /usr/lib/X11/app-defaults/Myterm\n\t$OPENWINHOME/lib/%T/%N    means /usr/openwin/lib/app-defaults/Myterm\n\nAs the application initializes, Xt tries to open both of the above\napp-defaults files, in the order shown.  As soon as it finds one, it\nreads it and uses it, and stops looking for others.  The effect of\nthis path is to search first in /usr/lib/X11, then in /usr/openwin.\n\nLet's consider another example. This time, let's set\nXUSERFILESEARCHPATH so it looks for the file Myterm.ad in the current\nworking directory, then for Myterm in the directory ~/app-defaults.\n\n\tsetenv XUSERFILESEARCHPATH ./%N.ad:$HOME/app-defaults/%N\n\nThe first path in the list expands to ./Myterm.ad.  The second expands\nto $HOME/app-defaults/Myterm.  This is a convenient setting for\ndebugging because it follows the Imake convention of naming the\napp-defaults file Myterm.ad in the application's source directory, so\nyou can run the application from the directory in which you are\nworking and still have the resources loaded properly.\n\nNOTE: when looking for app-default files with XUSERFILESEARCHPATH,\n      for some  bizarre reason, neither the type nor file suffix is\n      defined so %T and %S are useless.\n\nWith R5, there's another twist.  You may specify a customization\nresource value.  For example, you might run the \"myterm\" application\nlike this:\n\n\tmyterm -xrm \"*customization: -color\"\n\nIf one of your pathname specifications had the value\n\"/usr/lib/X11/app-defaults/%N%C\" then the expanded pathname would be\n\"/usr/lib/X11/app-defaults/Myterm-color\" because the %C substitution\ncharacter takes on the value of the customization resource.\n\nThe default XFILESEARCHPATH, compiled into Xt, is:\n\n\t\t/usr/lib/X11/%L/%T/%N%C:\\  (R5)\n\t\t/usr/lib/X11/%l/%T/%N%C:\\  (R5)\n\t\t/usr/lib/X11/%T/%N%C:\\     (R5)\n\t\t/usr/lib/X11/%L/%T/%N:\\\n\t\t/usr/lib/X11/%l/%T/%N:\\\n\t\t/usr/lib/X11/%T/%N\n\n(Note: some sites replace /usr/lib/X11 with a ProjectRoot in this\nbatch of default settings.)\n\nThe default XUSERFILESEARCHPATH, also compiled into Xt, is \n\n\t\t<root>/%L/%N%C:\\  (R5)\n\t\t<root>/%l/%N%C:\\  (R5)\n\t\t<root>/%N%C:\\     (R5)\n\t\t<root>/%L/%N:\\\n\t\t<root>/%l/%N:\\\n\t\t<root>/%N:\n\n<root> is either the value of XAPPLRESDIR or the user's home directory\nif XAPPLRESDIR is not set.  If you set XUSERFILESEARCHPATH to some\nvalue other than the default, Xt ignores XAPPLRESDIR altogether.\n\nNotice that the quick and dirty way of making your application find\nyour app-defaults file in your current working directory is to set\nXAPPLRESDIR to \".\", a single dot.  In R3, all this machinery worked\ndifferently; for R3 compatibilty, many people set their XAPPLRESDIR\nvalue to \"./\", a dot followed by a slash.\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n21. What order are callbacks executed in?\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n(Courtesy of Donna Converse, converse@expo.lcs.mit.edu; 5/10/92)\n\nThe Intrinsics library do not guarantee an order.  This is because\nboth the widget writer and the application writer have the ability to\nmodify the entire contents of the callback list.  Neither one\ncurrently knows what the other is doing and so the Intrinsics cannot\nguarantee the order of execution.\n\nThe application programmer cannot rely on the widget writer; the\nwidget writer is not required to document when the widget will add and\nremove callbacks from the list or what effect this will have;\ntherefore the functionality contained in a callback should be\nindependent of the functionality contained in other callbacks on the\nlist.\n\nEven though the Xt standard in the definition of XtAddCallback\n\n \t\"callback_name: Specifies the callback list to which the\n \tprocedure is to be appended.\"\n \nyou may not infer from the word \"appended\" that the callback routines\nare called in the same order as they have been added to the callback\nlist.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n22. How do I know if a widget is visible?\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n(Courtesy of Donna Converse, converse@expo.lcs.mit.edu; 5/14/92)\n\n\nRight, everything is implemented correctly.  This demonstrates a \"deficiency\"\nin the X protocol, and the Core widget is reflecting the capabilities of the\nprotocol.  (The \"deficiency\" is that the information is available in one way,\nin this case an inconvenient way.)  The Xt specification is accurate, in\nthe second and third paragraphs of section 7.10.2, so read this section\ncarefully.  The visible field will not change in response to iconification.\n\nA VisibilityNotify event will not be received when the window goes from\nviewable to unviewable, that is, when the widget or an ancestor is unmapped;\nthat is, when iconification occurs.  This is the protocol deficiency.\nVisibility state and viewable state have specific meanings in the X protocol;\nsee the glossary in your Xlib and X protocol reference manual.\n\n\nYou'll see this with any window manager, with no window manager.\n\n\nAs an application writer, keep track with a global Boolean in an action\nroutine with translations for MapNotify and UnmapNotify on the Shell widget\nwhich contains your custom widget.  As the custom widget writer, see the\nmap_state field returned by a call to XGetWindowAttributes.  These are\nsuggestions.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n23. How do I reparent a widget in Xt, i.e. XtReparentWidget()?\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nYou can't.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n24. Why use XtMalloc, XtFree, etc?\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nUnfortunately, most code that calls malloc(), realloc() or calloc()\ntends to ignore the possibility of returning NULL.  At best it is\nhandled something like:\n\n\tptr = (type *) malloc (sizeof (type))\n\tif (!ptr)\n\t{\n\t\tperror (\"malloc in xyzzy()\");\n\t\texit (1)\n\t}\nTo handle this common case the Intrinsics define the functions\nXtMalloc(), XtCalloc(), XtNew(), XtNewString() and XtRealloc() which\nall use the standard C language functions malloc(), calloc() and\nrealloc() but execute XtErrorMsg() if a NULL value is returned.  Xt\nerror handlers are not supposed to return so this effectively exits.\n\nIn addition, if XtRealloc() is called with a NULL pointer, it uses\nXtMalloc() to get the initial space.  This allows code like:\n\n\tif (!ptr)\n\t\tptr = (type *) malloc (sizeof (type));\n\telse\n\t\tptr = (type *) realloc (ptr, sizeof (type) * (count + 1));\n\t++count;\n\nto be written as:\n\n\tptr = XtRealloc (ptr, sizeof (ptr) * ++count);\n\nAlso, XtFree() accepts a NULL pointer as an argument.  Generally, I've\nfound the Xt functions conveniant to use.  However, anytime I'm\nallocating anything potentially large I use the standard functions so\nI can fully recover from not enough memory errors.\n\nXtNew() and XtNewString() are conveniant macros for allocating a\nstructure or copying a string:\n\n\t  struct abc *xyzzy;\n\t  char\t     *ptr;\n\t  char\t     *str = \"abcdef\";\n\n\t  xyzzy = XtNew (struct abc);\t/* takes care of type casting */\n\t  ptr = XtNewString (str);\n\nA strict interpretation of the Intrinsics reference manual allow an\nimplementation to provide functions that are not exchangable with\nmalloc() and free().  I.e. code such as:\n\n\t char\t      *ptr;\n\n\t ptr = XtMalloc (100);\n\t /* ... */\n\t free (ptr);\n\nmay not work.  Personally, I'd call any implementation that did this\nbroken and complain to the vendor.\n\nA common error for Motif programmers is to use XtFree() on a string\nwhen they should really be using XmStringFree().\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n25. How to debug an Xt application?\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nFirst, I'd recomend getting \"purify\" from Pure Software.  This is a\ngreat package for tracing memory problems on Sun's.  It's a bit pricey\nat $2750 but I'd still recomend it.  Excuse the marketing blurb\n(contact support@pure.com for more info).\n\n\tPurify inserts additional checking instructions directly into\n\tthe object code produced by existing compilers.  These\n\tinstructions check every memory read and write performed by\n\tthe program under test and detect several types of access\n\terrors, such as reading unitialized memory, writing past\n\tmalloc'd bounds, or writing to freed memory.  Purify inserts\n\tchecking logic into all of the code in a program, including\n\tthird party and vendor object-code libraries, and verifies\n\tsystem call interfaces.  In addition, Purify tracks memory\n\tusage and identifies individual memory leaks using a novel\n\tadaption of garbage collection techniques.  Purify's nearly\n\tcomprehensive memory access checking slows the target program\n\tdown typically by a factor of two to five.\n\nAn alternative package that isn't as pricey ($395 for a Sun), runs on\nmany Unix's and has pretty similar features is \"The SENTINEL Debugging\nEnvironment\".  This replaces malloc() and several other C library\nfunctions to add additional checks.  (contact cpcahil@virtech.vti.com\nfor more info)\n\nNext, if you are getting any sort of Xlib error, you'll need to run in\nsynchronous mode, easily accomplished with the \"-sync\" command line\nargument or by setting the variable Xdebug to 1 with your debugger.  Then\nset a break point in exit().  This will let you trace back to the\noriginal Xlib function being called.  If you don't run in synchronous\nmode, then the actual error may have occured any number of calls to\nXlib previously since the Xlib calls are buffered and replies from the\nserver are asynchronous.\n\nNext, if you are having trouble with window layout, you can use the\nundocumented resource \"xtIdentifyWindows\" or the class resource\n\"XtDebug\" to cause the widget name to be identified with each window.\nFor example:\n\n    example% xload -xrm '*XtDebug:true' &\n    example% xwininfo -tree\n\t     <click in new xload window>\n\nwill give the normal information but the widget name and class of each\nwindow is included.  This can help for checking the location and size\nof errant widgets.\n\nNext, if you are having trouble with geometry managers or you want to\ntest the way a widget manages it's children, you can try\nexport.lcs.mit.edu:contrib/libXtGeo.tar.Z.  This acts as a filter\nbetween any children and a geometry manager and checks the behaviour\nof both.  It's a very clever idea.\n\nThe most unfortunate problem is debugging a callback while the\napplication is executing a grab of the keyboard or mouse (such as from\na pulldown menu).  The server effectively locks up and you'll need to\ngo to another machine and kill the debugger manually.  The server\nlocks up because the application being debugged has said no one else\ncan have access to the keyboard but the application is not stopped\nwaiting because the debugger is waiting for your commands.\nUnfortunately you can't give them because all the input is going to\nyour application which is stopped.\n\nThe best way to debug this kind of problem is with two machines on\nyour desk, running the program under a debugger (or other environment)\non one machine, and running the application on the other, possibly\nusing a command sequence like this:\n\n\tothermachine% xhost +thismachine\n\tthismachine% setenv DISPLAY othermachine:0;\n\tthismachine% gdb application\t# Your favorite debugger.\n\tor this:\n\tothermachine% xhost +thismachine\n\tthismachine% gdb application\n\t(gdb) set environment DISPLAY othermachine:0\n\t(gdb) run ...\n\nI believe CodeCenter, a C interpreter/graphical debugger has a method\nof dealing with this by explicitely calling the Xlib functions to\nrelease any grabs during breakpoints.\n\nDebugging widget problems requires pretty good debugging skills and\nknowledge of how widgets work.  You can go a long way without knowing\nthe internals of a particular widget but not very far without\nunderstanding how a widget works.  Judicious use of conditional\nbreakpoints and adding print statements with the debugger help a great\ndeal.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n26. Why don't XtAddInput(), XtAddTimeout() and XtAddWorkProc() work?\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n   I have got a delicate problem with the three routines XtAddInput,\n   XtAddTimeOut and XtAddWorkProc. The problem I have is that when\n   I use them in my application they seem not to be registred properly.\n   I have made a handy little testprogram where everything works\n   perfect, but in my \"real\" application nothing happens. \n\nThe introduction in R3 of the XtApp*() functions obsoleted those\nroutines (see Q19 for other changes in R3, R4, and R5).  What happens is\nthey use a default application context different then the one you may\nhave created.  Since events and timeouts are distributed on a per\napplication context basis and you are using two application contexts,\nyou won't get those events.\n\nFor example:\n\n\t...\n\tcnt = 0;\n\ttoplevel = XtAppInitialize(&app, class,\n\t\t\t\t   Desc, XtNumber (Desc),\n\t\t\t\t   &argc, argv,\n\t\t\t\t   Fallback, args, cnt);\n\n\tXtAddTimeOut (...)\n\tXtAddWorkProc (...)\n\n\tXtAppMainLoop (app)\n\nwould never invoke the timeout.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n27. What is and how can I implement drag and drop?\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n(Courtesy of Roger Reynolds, rogerr@netcom.com; 19 Feb 93)\n\nDrag-n-drop is a buzzword for moving data between clients, in an\n``intuitive'' fashion.\n\nMotif Version 1.2 supports drag-n-drop capabilities, OpenLook has\nsupported d-n-d all along.  The two protocols are not compatable with\neach other, and so far as I know, they are not published.\n\nI wrote a package called RDD which is designed to be a flexible public\nprotocol for doing drag 'n drop operations between clients.  My\nintention was to provide a tool which would make it easy for people to\nsupport a \"standard\" drag-n-drop protocol in the programs they develop\nand contribute or sell, regardless of what widget set is used (as long\nas it is based on Xt).\n\nThe implementation is based upon my understanding of the ICCCM\nconventions, for more details read the code.\n\nI have heard from dozens of people using RDD who like it and feel that\nit works a whole lot better than Motif 1.2 stuff.  Also, there seem to\nbe many who think that it is neat but are constrained to use Motif\nanyway.\n\nThe latest RDD (and some other stuff) is available for ftp from\nnetcom.com, in /pub/rogerr.  A (possibly older) version is also\navailable on export.lcs.mit.edu in /contrib."},{"role":"assistant","content":"comp.windows.x"}]}

{"messages":[{"role":"system","content":"You are a helpful assistant who can classify newsletters into the right categories."},{"role":"user","content":"Avoiding mistakes is certainly highly desirable.  However it is also \nwidely acknowledged that perfectionism is inimicable to creativity. \nAnd in ordinary life, perfectionism carried beyond a certain point is \nindicative of a psychological disorder.  In the extreme case, a  \nperfectionist becomes so paralyzed by all the possible mistakes he might \nmake that he is unable to even leave the house.  \n\nIn science, we want to discover as much truth about the world as possible \nand we also want to have as much certainty as possible about these \ndiscoveries.  Usually there is some trade-off between these two desiderata \n--- the search for scope and the search for certainty.  \n\nIf 18th century mathematicians had demanded total rigor from Newton and \nLeibniz then there would probably be no calculus today, because neither \nof the two could explain calculus in a way that really made sense, since \nthey lacked the concept of a limit.  And in fact, because of the lack of \na rigorous foundation, they made a number of errors in their use of calculus. \nIt was only a hundred years later that Weistrass was able to give a solid \ngrounding for the ideas of Newton and Leibniz.  Nonetheless, what Newton \nand Leibniz did was undoubtedly science and mathematics gained a great \ndeal more from the application of their important ideas than it lost \nthrough the mistakes they made.  \n\n\nThese are not the rules according to many who post to sci.med and\nsci.psychology.  According to these posters  \"If it's not supported by\ncarefully designed controlled studies then it's not science.\"\n\nTaken to the extreme, I believe that the attitude that empirical studies \nare everything and ideas are nothing results in a complete stultification \nof science.  \n\nFor one thing, an insistence on an elaborate and expensive methodology \nresults in a sort of scientific trade-unionism, where those outside \nthe establishment and lacking institutional or corporate support have \nno chance to obtain a hearing.  (I don't in the least believe that this \nis the intention of the arbiters of scientific methodology.  Nonetheless, \nit is one of the results.)   And although institutional science has \ncertainly produced many wonderful results, I think it is a foolish \narrogance for scientists to believe that no one outside the establishment \n--- and using less than perfect empirical methodology --- will ever come \nwith anything worthwhile.  \n\nFurthermore, the big bucks approach to science promotes what I think is\none of the most significant errors in science:  choosing to investigate\nquestions because they can be readily handled by the currently\nfashionable methodology (or because one can readily get institutional\nor corporate sponsorship for them) instead of directing attention to\nthose questions which seem to have fundamental significance.\n\nFor instance, certain questions cannot be easily investigated with\nstatistical methods because the relevant factors are not quantitative.\n(One could argue that this is the case for almost all questions in many\nareas of psychology.  In my opinion, a perusal of many of the papers\nresulting from the attempt by psychologists to force these questions\ninto a statistical framework gives the lie to Russell Turpin's\nassertion that current scientific methods \"avoid all known errors.\")\n\nI think that asking the wrong question is probably the most fundamental \nerror in science.  (Ignoring potentially valuable ideas is one of the \nothers.)  And I think that scientific journals are full of all \ntoo many studies done with impeccable empirical methods but which are \nworthless because the wrong question was asked in the first place.  \n\n--\nIn the arguments between behaviorists and cognitivists, psychology seems \nless like a science than a collection of competing religious sects.

To find out more about\n  them and how to access them, please see the \"Introduction to the\n  news.answers newsgroup\" posting in news.answers.\n\n  The main FAQ archive is at rtfm.mit.edu [18.172.1.27].

If\n  you do not have access to anonymous ftp, you can retrieve it by\n  sending a mail message to mail-server@pit-manager.mit.edu with the\n  command \"send usenet/news.answers/x-faq/speedups\" in the message body.\n\n-----------------------------\nWhat about the \"Other X FAQ\"?\n-----------------------------\n\n  David B. Lewis (faq%craft@uunet.uu.net) maintains the informative and\n  well written \"comp.windows.x Frequently Asked Questions\" document.\n  Its focus is on general X information, while this FAQ concentrates\n  on performance.\n\n  The comp.windows.x FAQ does address the issue of speed, but only with\n  regards to the X server.  The gist of that topic seems to be:\n\t\"Use X11R5, it is faster than R4\".\n  (Please see the X FAQ for complete details).\n\n---------------\nWindow Managers\n---------------\n\n  There are a lot of window managers out there, with lots of different\n  features and abilities.  The choice of which to use is by necessity a\n  balancing act between performance and useful features.  At this\n  point, most respondents have agreed upon \"twm\" as the best candidate\n  for a speedy window manager. \n\n  A couple of generic tricks you can try to soup up your window manger,\n  is turning off unnecessary things like \"zooming\" and \"opaque move\".\n  Also, if you lay out your windows in a tiled manner, you reduce the\n  amount of cpu power spent in raising and lowering overlapping\n  windows.                           Joe English (joe@trystero.art.com)\n\n  I've found that a good font for tiling is 7x13 (aka:\n  -misc-fixed-medium-r-normal--13-100-100-100-c-70-iso8859-1 ). It is\n  the biggest font I know of that I can use on my Sun (1152x900 screen)\n  and still get two 80 column terminal windows side-by-side on the\n  display with no overlap.  Other font suggestions will be accepted.\n\n------------\nThe X Server\n------------\n\nWhich Server?\n- - - - - - -\n  Make sure that your server is a proper match for your hardware.\n  If you have a monochrome monitor, use a monochrome X11 server.\n\n  On my Monochrome Sun, I haven't noticed much difference between\n  the Xsun (colour) server and XsunMono, however it was pointed out to\n  me that XsunMono is about 800k smaller and therefore should contribute\n  to less paging.  \n         [ thanks to: Jonny Farringdon (j.farringdon@psychol.ucl.ac.uk),\n                        Michael Salmon (Michael.Salmon@eos.ericsson.se) ]\n\n  How your server was compiled can also make a difference.  Jeff Law\n  (law@schirf.cs.utah.edu) advises us that on a Sun system, X should be\n  compiled with gcc (version 2.*) or with the unbundled Sun compiler.\n  You can expect to get \"*very* large speedups in the server\" by not\n  using the bundled SunOS compiler.  I assume that similar results\n  would occur if you used one of the other high-quality commercial\n  compilers on the market.\n\nLocking the Server into RAM?\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n  Has anyone tried hacking the X server so that it is locked into RAM and\n  does not get paged?  eg: via a call to plock().  Does this help\n  performance at all?  I've had one inquiry on this topic, and a few\n  pointers to the plock() function call, but no hard evidence from someone\n  who's tried it.  I am not in a position to give it a try.  \n\t\t\t  [thanks to: Eric C Claeys (ecc@eperm.att.com),\n\t\t\t\t      Danny Backx (db@sunbim.be),\n\t\t\t\t      Juan D. Martin (juando@cnm.us.es) ]\nStarting your Server\n- - - - - - - - - - -\n  Joe English (joe@trystero.art.com) :\n    If you start up a lot of clients in your .xsession or whatever, sleep\n    for a second or two after launching each one.  After I changed my\n    .xclients script to do this, logging in actually took *less* time...\n    we have a heavily loaded system without much core, though.\n\n  This sounds crazy, but I have confirmed that it works!  \n\n  Warner Losh (imp@Solbourne.COM) provided me with a good explanation of\n  why this works, which I have summarized here:\n\n    When you start up an X server it takes a huge amount of time to\n    start accepting connections.  A lot of initialization is done by\n    the server when it starts.  This process touches a large number of\n    pages.  Any other process running at the same time would fight the\n    server for use of the CPU, and more importantly, memory.  If you\n    put a sleep in there, you give the Server a chance to get itself\n    sorted out before the clients start up.\n\n    Similarly, there is also a lot of initialization whenever an X\n    client program starts: toolkits registering widgets, resources\n    being fetched, programs initializing state and \"databases\" and so\n    forth.  All this activity is typically memory intensive.  Once this\n    initialization is done (\"The process has reached a steady state\"),\n    the memory usage typically settles down to using only a few pages.\n    By using sleeps to stagger the launching of your clients in your\n    .Xinitrc , you avoid them fighting each other for your\n    workstation's limited resources\n\n  This is most definitely a \"Your Mileage May Vary\" situation, as there\n  are so many variables to be considered: available RAM, local swap\n  space, load average, number of users on your system, which clients\n  you are starting, etc.\n\n  Currently in my .xinitrc I have a situation like:\n\t(sleep 1; exec xclock ) &\n\t(sleep 1; exec xbiff ) &\n\t(sleep 1; exec xterm ) &\n\t(sleep 1; exec xterm ) &\n\n  I've experimented with:\n\t(sleep 1; exec xclock ) &\n\t(sleep 2; exec xbiff ) &\n\t(sleep 3; exec xterm ) &\n\t(sleep 4; exec xterm ) &\n\n  I've even tried:\n\t(sleep 2; exec start_X_clients_script ) &\n  and then in start_X_clients_script I had:\n\t(sleep 1; exec xclock ) &\n\t(sleep 1; exec xbiff ) &\n\t(sleep 1; exec xterm ) &\n\t(sleep 1; exec xterm ) &\n\n    [ The idea with this last one was to make sure that xinit had\n    completely finished processing my .xinitrc, and had settled down\n    into a \"steady state\" before the sleep expired and all my clients\n    were launched. ]\n\n  All of these yielded fairly comparable results, and so I just stuck with\n  my current setup, for its simplicity.  You will probably have to\n  experiment a bit to find a setup which suits you.\n\nFonts\n- - -\n  Loading fonts takes time and RAM.  If you minimize the number of fonts\n  your applications use, you'll get speed increases in load-up time.\n\n  One simple strategy is to choose a small number of fonts (one small, one\n  large, one roman, whatever suits you) and configure all your clients -- or\n  at least all your heavily used clients -- to use only those few fonts.\n  Client programs should start up quicker if their font is already loaded\n  into the server.  This will also conserve server resources, since fewer\n  fonts will be loaded by the server.\n\t\t\t      [ Farrell McKay (fbm@ptcburp.ptcbu.oz.au),\n\t\t\t        Joe English (joe@trystero.art.com) ]\n\n  eg: My main xterm font is 7x13, so I also have twm set up to use 7x13\n  in all it's menus and icons etc.  Twm's default font is 8x13.  Since\n  I don't normally use 8x13, I've eliminated one font from my server.\n\n  Oliver Jones (oj@roadrunner.pictel.com):\n    Keep fonts local to the workstation, rather than loading them over nfs.\n    If you will make extensive use of R5 scalable fonts, use a font server.\n\nAbout the Resources File\n- - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\n    Keep your .Xresources / .Xdefaults file small.  Saves RAM and saves\n    on server startup time.          Joe English (joe@trystero.art.com)\n\n  One suggestion:\n\n    In your .Xdefaults (.Xresources) file, try putting only the minimum\n    number of resources that you want to have available to all of your\n    applications.  For example:  *reverseVideo: true\n\n    Then, separate your resources into individual client-specific\n    resource files.  For example: $HOME/lib/app-defaults.  In your\n    .login file set the environment variable XUSERFILESEARCHPATH:\n\n\tsetenv XUSERFILESEARCHPATH $HOME/lib/app-defaults/%N\n\n    [ The \"comp.windows.x Frequently Asked Questions\" FAQ contains\n    an excellent explanation of how these environment variables work.\n    --ed.]\n\n    So, when xterm launches, it loads its resources from\n    .../app-defaults/XTerm.  Xdvi finds them in .../app-defaults/XDvi,\n    and so on and so forth.  Note that not all clients follow the same\n    XXxxx resource-file naming pattern.  You can check in your system\n    app-defaults directory (often: /usr/X11R5/lib/X11/app-defaults/) to\n    find the proper name, and then name your personal resource files\n    with the same name.\n\n    This is all documented in the Xt Specification (pg 125 & 666).\n\t\t    [Thanks to: Kevin Samborn (samborn@mtkgc.com),\n\t\t         Michael Urban (urban@cobra.jpl.nasa.gov),\n\t\t             and Mike Long (mikel@ee.cornell.edu).\n\t     Kevin is willing mail his setup files to inquirers.]\n\n  This method of organizing your personal resources has the following\n  benefits:\n\n    - Easier to maintain / more usable.\n\n    - Fewer resources are stored in the X server in the RESOURCE_MANAGER\n      property.  As a side benefit your server may start fractionally\n      quicker, since it doesn`t have to load all your resources.\n\n    - Applications only process their own resources, never have to sort \n      through all of your resources to find the ones that affect them.\n\n  It also has drawbacks:\n\n    - the application that you are interested in has to load an\n      additional file every time it starts up.  This doesn't seem to\n      make that much of a performance difference, and you might\n      consider this a huge boon to usability.  If you are modifying an\n      application's resource database, you just need to re-run the\n      application without having to \"xrdb\" again.\n\n    - xrdb will by default run your .Xdefaults file through cpp.  When\n      your resources are split out into multiple resource files and\n      then loaded by the individual client programs, they will not.\n      WATCH OUT FOR THIS!!\n\n      I had C style comments in my .Xdefaults file, which cpp stripped\n      out.  When I switched to this method of distributed resource\n      files I spent several frustrating days trying to figure out why\n      my clients were not finding their resources.  Xt did *NOT*\n      provide any error message when it encountered the C style\n      comments in the resource files, it simply, silently, aborted\n      processing the resource file.\n\n      The loss of preprocessing (which can be very handy, e.g. ``#ifdef\n      COLOR'' ...) is enough to cause some people to dismiss this\n      method of resource management.\n\n    - You may also run into some clients which break the rules.  For\n      example, neither Emacs (18.58.3) nor Xvt (1.0) will find their\n      resources if they are anywhere other than in .Xdefaults.\n\n    - when starting up a client on a machine that does not share files\n      with the machine where your resources are stored, your client\n      will not find its resources.  Loading all your resources into the\n      server will guarantee that all of your clients will always find\n      their resources.            Casey Leedom (casey@gauss.llnl.gov)\n\n  A possible compromise suggestion that I have (and am planning on trying)\n  is to put resources for all my heavily used clients (eg: xterm) into my\n  .Xdefaults file, and to use the \"separate resources files\" method for\n  clients that I seldom use.\n\nDefine Your Display Properly\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\n  Client programs are often executed on the same machine as the server.  In\n  that situation, rather than setting your DISPLAY environment variable to \n  \"<hostname>:0.0\", where <hostname> is the name of your workstation, you\n  should set your DISPLAY variable to \"unix:0.0\" or \":0.0\".  By doing this\n  you access optimized routines that know that the server is on the same\n  machine and use a shared memory method of transferring requests.\n\t\t\t[thanks to Patrick J Horgan (pjh70@ras.amdahl.com)]\n\n  See the _DISPLAY NAMES_ section of the X(1) man page for further\n  explanation of how to properly set your display name.\n\n  \"I don't think it's stock MIT, but (at least) Data General and HP have\n  libraries that are smart enough to use local communication even when\n  the DISPLAY isn't set specially.\"\n\t\t\t      Rob Sartin (88opensi!sartin@uunet.UU.NET)\n\n  [Jody Goldberg (jody@algorithmics.com) sent me an Xlib patch to change\n  stock R5 to use local communication even if DISPLAY is not properly set.\n  I don't want to get in the business of distributing or trying to juggle\n  non-MIT patches and so have elected not to include it here.  Hopefully MIT\n  will apply this minor (~8 lines) patch themselves.  In the meantime, if\n  you want to try it yourself, email Jody.  --ed.]\n\n-------\nClients\n-------\n\n  If you only have a few megabytes of Ram then you should think\n  carefully about the number of programs you are running.  Think also\n  about the _kind_ of programs you are running.  For example:  Is there\n  a smaller clock program than xclock?\n\n  Unfortunately, I haven't really noticed that programs advertise how large\n  they are, so the onus is on us to do the research and spread the word.\n\n  [ Suggestions on better alternatives to the some of the standard clients\n  (eg: Xclock, Xterm, Xbiff) are welcome.  --ed.]\n\n  I've received some contradictory advice from people, on the subject\n  of X client programs.  Some advocate the use of programs that are\n  strictly Xlib based, since Xt, Xaw and other toolkits are rather\n  large.  Others warn us that other applications which you are using\n  may have already loaded up one or more of these shared libraries.  In\n  this case, using a non-Xt (for example) client program may actually\n  _increase_ the amount of RAM consumed.\n\n  The upshot of all this seems to be: Don't mix toolkits.  That is, try\n  and use just Athena clients, or just Xview clients (or just Motif\n  clients, etc).  If you use more than one, then you're dragging in\n  more than one toolkit library.\n\n  Know your environment, and think carefully about which client\n  programs would work best together in that environment.\n\n\t\t  [Thanks to: Rob Sartin (88opensi!sartin@uunet.UU.NET),\n      Duncan Sinclair (sinclair@dcs.gla.ac.uk | sinclair@uk.ac.gla.dcs) ]\n\nA Better Clock for X\n- - - - - - - - - - -\n\n1) xcuckoo\n   suggested by: Duncan Sinclair (sinclair@dcs.gla.ac.uk)\n   available: on export.lcs.mit.edu\n\n   Xcuckoo displays a clock in the title bar of *another* program.\n   Saves screen real estate.\n\n2) mclock\n   suggested by: der Mouse (mouse@Lightning.McRCIM.McGill.EDU)\n   available: larry.mcrcim.mcgill.edu (132.206.1.1) in /X/mclock.shar\n\n   Non Xt-based.

You don't have to\n   rename your resources, as xvt pretends to be XTerm.  In it's current\n   version, you cannot bind keys as you can in xterm.  I've heard that\n   there are versions of xvt with this feature, but I've not found any\n   yet.\n\n   UPDATE (March 1993):  I recently had a few email conversations with\n   Brian Warkentin (brian.warkentine@eng.sun.com) regarding xvt.  He\n   questions whether xvt really is at all faster than xterm.  For\n   instance, xvt may initialize slightly faster, but compare scrolling\n   speed (try this quickie benchmark: /bin/time dd if=/etc/termcap\n   bs=40) and see which program can scroll faster.  Also, while xterm\n   may be slightly larger in RAM requirements (We don't have any hard\n   numbers here, does anyone else?) shared libraries and shared text\n   segments mean that xterm's paging requirements are not that major.\n\n   As an experiment, he ripped out all the tek stuff from xterm, but it\n   made little difference, since if you never use it, it never gets\n   brought into memory.\n\n   So here we stand with some conflicting reports on the validity of\n   xvt over xterm.  In summary?  Caveat Emptor, your mileage may vary.\n   If you can provide some hard data, I'd like to see it.\n   Specifically: How much RAM each occupies, how much swap each needs,\n   relative speed of each\n\n2) mterm\n   suggested by: der Mouse (mouse@Lightning.McRCIM.McGill.EDU)\n   available: larry.mcrcim.mcgill.edu (132.206.1.1) in\n     /X/mterm.src/mterm.ball-o-wax.\n\n   \"I also have my own terminal emulator.

Examining the what was\n    going on with xscope I found it.  It seems that when the resource\n    XmNblinkRate is non-zero and the focus is on a text field widget\n    (or even just a text widget) the I-beam cursor will blink.\n    Every time the cursor appears or disappears in those widgets, the\n    widget code is making a request to the server (CopyArea).  The user\n    can stop this by setting the resource XmNblinkRate to 0.  It is not\n    noticeable on a 40MHz SPARC, but it does make a little difference\n    on a [slower system].\n\n  This specific suggestion can probably be applied in general to lots\n  of areas.  Consider your heavily used clients, are there any minor\n  embellishments that can be turned off and thereby save on Server\n  requests?\n\n-------------------------\nMiscellaneous Suggestions\n-------------------------\n\nPretty Pictures\n- - - - - - - -\n  Don't use large bitmaps (GIF's, etc) as root window backgrounds.\n\n  - The more complicated your root window bitmap, the slower the server\n    is at redrawing your screen when you reposition windows (or redraw, etc)\n\n  - These take up RAM, and CPU power.  I work on a Sun SPARC and I'm\n    conscious of performance issues, I can't comprehend it when I see\n    people with a 4mb Sun 3/60 running xphoon as their root window.\n\n    I'll let someone else figure out how much RAM would be occupied by\n    having a full screen root image on a colour workstation.\n\n  - If you're anything like me, you need all the screen real estate\n    that you can get for clients, and so rarely see the root window anyway.\n\n\t\t      [ Thanks to Qiang Alex Zhao (azhao@cs.arizona.edu) \n\t\t\tfor reminding me of this one. --ed.]\n\nA Quicker Mouse\n- - - - - - - -\n  Using xset, you can adjust how fast your pointer moves on the screen\n  when you move your mouse.  I use \"xset m 3 10\" in my .xinitrc file,\n  which lets me send my pointer across the screen with just a flick of\n  the wrist.  See the xset man page for further ideas and information.\n\n  Hint: sometimes you may want to *slow down* your mouse tracking for\n  fine work.  To cover my options, I have placed a number of different\n  mouse setting commands into a menu in my window manager.  \n\n  e.g. (for twm) :\n      menu \"mouse settings\" {\n        \"Mouse Settings:\"\t\t\tf.title\n\t\"  Very Fast\"\t\t\t\t! \"xset m 7 10 &\"\n\t\"  Normal (Fast)\"\t\t\t! \"xset m 3 10 &\"\n\t\"  System Default (Un-Accelerated)\"\t! \"xset m default &\"\n\t\"  Glacial\"\t\t\t\t! \"xset m 0 10 &\"\n      }\n\nProgramming Thoughts\n- - - - - - - - - - -\n  Joe English (joe@trystero.art.com) :\n    To speed up applications that you're developing, there are tons of\n    things you can do.  Some that stick out:\n\n    - For Motif programs, don't set XmFontList resources for individual\n      buttons, labels, lists, et. al.; use the defaultFontList or\n      labelFontList or whatever resource of the highest-level manager\n      widget.  Again, stick to as few fonts as possible.\n\n    - Better yet, don't use Motif at all.  It's an absolute pig.\n\n    - Don't create and destroy widgets on the fly.  Try to reuse them.\n      (This will avoid many problems with buggy toolkits, too.)\n\n    - Use a line width of 0 in GCs.  On some servers this makes a HUGE\n      difference.\n\n    - Compress and collapse multiple Expose events.  This can make the\n      difference between a fast application and a completely unusable\n      one.\n\n  Francois Staes (frans@kiwi.uia.ac.be) :\n    Just a small remark: I once heard that using a better malloc\n    function would greatly increase performance of Xt based\n    applications since they use malloc heavily. They suggested trying\n    out the GNUY malloc, but I didn't find the time yet. I did some\n    tests on small programs just doing malloc and free, and the\n    differences were indeed very noticeable ( somewhat 5 times faster)\n\n  [ Any confirmation on this from anyone?  --ed.]\n\n  Andre' Beck (Andre_Beck@IRS.Inf.TU-Dresden.de) :\n\n  - Unnecessary NoExpose Events.\n\n    Most people use XCopyArea/XCopyPlane as fastest blit routines, but\n    they forget to reset graphics_exposures in the GC used for the\n    blits. This will cause a NoExpose Event every blit, that, in most\n    cases, only puts load onto the connection and forces the client to\n    run through it's event-loop again and again.\n\n  - Thousands of XChangeGC requests.\n\n    This \"Gfx Context Switching\" is also seen in most handcoded X-Apps,\n    where only one or few GCs are created and then heavily changed\n    again and again.  Xt uses a definitely better mechanism, by caching\n    and sharing a lot of GCs with all needed parameters. This will\n    remove the load of subsequent XChangeGC requests from the\n    connection (by moving it toward the client startup phase).\n\nSay What!?\n- - - - - - \n  Some contributors proposed ideas that seem right off the wall at first:\n\n  David B. Lewis (by day: dbl@osf.org, by night: david%craft@uunet.uu.net) :\n    How about this: swap displays with someone else. Run all your programs\n    on the other machine and display locally; the other user runs off your\n    machine onto the other display. Goal: reduce context switches in the\n    same operation between client and server.\n\n  I'm not in a situation where I can easily try this, but I have received\n  the following confirmation...\n\n  Michael Salmon (Michael.Salmon@eos.ericsson.se):\n    I regularly run programs on other machines and I notice a big\n    difference. I try to run on a machine where I will reduce net usage\n    and usually with nice to reduce the impact of my intrusion.

Not really a\n    major problem, except that the X11 client and the server are in\n    absolute synchronicity and are context thrashing.\n\n  Timothy H Panton (thp@westhawk.uucp) :\n    Firstly it relies on the fact that most CPU's are mostly idle, X's\n    cpu usage is bursty.  so the chances of you and your teammate\n    doing something cpu-intensive at the same time is small. If they\n    are not then you get twice the cpu+memory available for your\n    action.\n\n    The second factor is that context switches are expensive, using 2\n    cpu's halves them, you pay a price due to the overhead of going\n    over the network, but this is offset in most cases by the improved\n    buffering of a network (typically 20k vs 4k for a pipe), allowing\n    even fewer context switches.\n\n----------------------------\nOther Sources of Information\n----------------------------\n\n  Volume 8 in O'Reilly's X Window System Series, ``X Window System\n  Administrator's Guide'' is a book all X administrator's should read.\n\n  Adrian Nye (adrian@ora.com):\n    A lot more tips on performance are in the paper \"Improving X\n    Application Performance\" by Chris D.

Well,\nanyway, it is not surprising that Armenians also collaborated with the \nNazis.\n\n \"Wholly opportunistic the Dashnaktzoutun have been variously\n  pro-Nazi, pro-Russia, pro-Soviet Armenia, pro-Arab, pro-Jewish,\n  as well as anti-Jewish, anti-Zionist, anti-Communist, and \n  anti-Soviet - whichever was expedient.\"[1]\n\n[1] John Roy Carlson (Arthur Derounian), 'Cairo to Damascus,' \n    Alfred A. Knopf, New York, 1951, p. 438.\n  \nAs a dear friend put it, the Tzeghagrons (Armenian Racial Patriots) \nwas the youth organization of the Dashnaktzoutun. It was based in\nBoston (where ASALA/SDPA/ARF Terrorism Triangle is located) but \nhad followers in Armenian colonies all over the world. Literally\nTzeghagron means 'to make a religion of one's race.' The architect\nof the Armenian Racial Patriots was Garegin Nezhdeh, a Nazi Armenian\nwho became a key leader of collaboration with Hitler in World War II.\nIn 1933, he had been invited to the United States by the Central\nCommittee of the Dashnaktzoutun to inspire and organize the \nAmerican-Armenian youth. Nezhdeh succeeded in unifying many local\nArmenian youth groups in the Tzeghagrons. Starting with 20\nchapters in the initial year, the Tzeghagrons grew to 60 chapters\nand became the largest and most powerful Nazi Armenian organization.\nNezhdeh also provided the Tzeghagrons with a philosophy:\n\n \"The Racial Religious beliefs in his racial blood as a deity.\n  Race above everything and before everything. Race comes first.\"[1]\n\n[1] Quoted in John Roy Carlson (real name Arthur Derounian), \"The\n    Armenian Displaced Persons,\" in 'Armenian Affairs,' Winter,\n    1949-50, p. 19, footnote.\n\n\nNow wait, there is more.\n\nTHE GRUESOME extent of February's killings of Azeris by Armenians\nin the town  of Hojali is at last emerging  in Azerbaijan - about\n600 men,  women and  children dead  in the  worst outrage  of the\nfour-year war over Nagorny Karabakh.\n\nThe figure  is drawn  from Azeri investigators,  Hojali officials\nand casualty lists published in the Baku press. Diplomats and aid\nworkers say the death toll is in line with their own estimates.\n\nThe 25  February attack on Hojali  by Armenian forces was  one of\nthe last moves  in their four-year campaign to  take full control\nof Nagorny Karabakh,  the subject of a new  round of negotiations\nin Rome on Monday. The bloodshed was something between a fighting\nretreat and  a massacre, but  investigators say that most  of the\ndead were civilians. The awful  number of people killed was first\nsuppressed by  the fearful  former Communist government  in Baku.\nLater  it  was blurred  by  Armenian  denials and  grief-stricken\nAzerbaijan's wild  and contradictory  allegations of up  to 2,000\ndead.\n\nThe State Prosecuter, Aydin Rasulov,  the cheif investigator of a\n15-man  team  looking  into  what Azerbaijan  calls  the  \"Hojali\nDisaster\", said  his figure of 600  people dead was a  minimum on\npreliminary  findings.  A similar  estimate  was  given by  Elman\nMemmedov, the mayor of Hojali. An  even higher one was printed in\nthe Baku newspaper  Ordu in May - 479 dead  people named and more\nthan 200 bodies reported unidentified.  This figure of nearly 700\ndead is quoted as official by Leila Yunusova, the new spokeswoman\nof the Azeri Ministry of Defence.\n\nFranCois Zen  Ruffinen, head  of delegation of  the International\nRed Cross  in Baku, said  the Muslim imam  of the nearby  city of\nAgdam had reported a figure of  580 bodies received at his mosque\nfrom  Hojali, most  of  them  civilians. \"We  did  not count  the\nbodies. But  the figure seems  reasonable. It is no  fantasy,\" Mr\nZen Ruffinen said. \"We have some idea since we gave the body bags\nand products to wash the dead.\"\n\nMr  Rasulov endeavours  to give  an unemotional  estimate of  the\nnumber of  dead in the  massacre. \"Don't  get worked up.  It will\ntake  several months  to  get a  final  figure,\" the  43-year-old\nlawyer said at his small office.\n\nMr Rasulov  knows about these  things. It  took him two  years to\nreach  a firm  conclusion that  131  people were  killed and  714\nwounded  when  Soviet  troops  and tanks  crushed  a  nationalist\nuprising in Baku in January 1990.\n\nThose  nationalists, the  Popular  Front, finally  came to  power\nthree weeks  ago and  are applying pressure  to find  out exactly\nwhat  happened when  Hojali, an  Azeri town  which lies  about 70\nmiles from the border with Armenia, fell to the Armenians.\n\nOfficially, 184 people have so  far been certified as dead, being\nthe  number of  people that  could be  medically examined  by the\nrepublic's forensic department. \"This  is just a small percentage\nof the dead,\" said Rafiq Youssifov, the republic's chief forensic\nscientist. \"They were the only bodies brought to us. Remember the\nchaos and the fact that we are  Muslims and have to wash and bury\nour dead within 24 hours.\"\n\nOf these 184 people, 51 were women, and 13 were children under 14\nyears old.  Gunshots killed  151 people,  shrapnel killed  20 and\naxes or  blunt instruments  killed 10.  Exposure in  the highland\nsnows killed the last three.  Thirty-three people showed signs of\ndeliberate mutilation, including ears,  noses, breasts or penises\ncut off and  eyes gouged out, according  to Professor Youssifov's\nreport. Those 184 bodies examined were less than a third of those\nbelieved to have been killed, Mr Rasulov said.\n\nFiles  from  Mr  Rasulov's  investigative  commission  are  still\ndisorganised -  lists of 44  Azeri militiamen are dead  here, six\npolicemen there,  and in handwriting  of a mosque  attendant, the\nnames of  111 corpses brought to  be washed in just  one day. The\nmost heartbreaking account from  850 witnesses interviewed so far\ncomes  from Towfiq  Manafov,  an Azeri  investigator  who took  a\nhelicopter  flight  over  the  escape route  from  Hojali  on  27\nFebruary.\n\n\"There were too many bodies of  dead and wounded on the ground to\ncount properly: 470-500  in Hojali, 650-700 people  by the stream\nand the road and 85-100  visible around Nakhchivanik village,\" Mr\nManafov  wrote in  a  statement countersigned  by the  helicopter\npilot.\n\n\"People waved up  to us for help. We saw  three dead children and\none  two-year-old alive  by  one  dead woman.  The  live one  was\npulling at her arm for the mother to get up. We tried to land but\nArmenians started a barrage against  our helicopter and we had to\nreturn.\"\n\nThere  has been  no consolidation  of  the lists  and figures  in\ncirculation because  of the political  upheavals of the  last few\nmonths and the  fact that nobody knows exactly who  was in Hojali\nat the time - many inhabitants were displaced from other villages\ntaken over by Armenian forces.\n\nTHE INDEPENDENT, London, 12/6/'92\n\nSerdar Argic"},{"role":"assistant","content":"talk.politics.mideast"}]}

Jewish religion was the foundation for Christianity and\nIslam.  In other words Judaism has fathered both religions. Now Islam has turned against its father I may say.\nIt is Ironic that after communizem threat is almost gone, religion wars are going to be on the raise. \nI thought the idea of believing on one God, was to Unite all man kind. How come both Jews and Islam which believe\non the same God, \"the God of Ebrahim\" are killing each other? Is this like Dr. Frankenstien's story?\nHow are you going to stop this from happening? How are you going to deal with so many Muslims. Nuking them \nwould distroy the whole world? Would God get mad, since you have killed his followers, you believe on the same\nGod, same heaven and the same hell after all? What is the peacefull way of ending this Saga?\n\n\nMan kind needs religion, since it sets up the rules and the regulations which keeps the society in a healthy state.\nA religion is mostly a sets of rules which people have experienced and know it works for the society.\nThe praying, keeps the sole healthy and meditates it. God does not care for man kinds pray, but man kind hopes\nthat God will help him when he prays.\nReligion works mostly on the moral issues and trys to put away the materialistic things in the life. But the \nreligious leaders need to make a living through religion? So they  may corrupt it, or turn it to their own way to\nmake their living. i.e Muslims have to pay  %20 percent of their income to the Mullahs. I guess the rabie  gets his\ncut too! \n\nIs in it that religion should be such that everybody on planet earth respects each other, be good toward each other\nhelps one another, respect the mother nature. Is in that heaven and hell are created on earth through the acts \nthat we take today?  Is in it that within every man there is good and bad, he could choose either one, then he will\nsee the outcome of his choice.  How can we prevent man kind from going crazy over religion. How can we stop\nanother religious killing field, under poor Gods name? What are your thoughts? Do you think man kind would\nto come its senses, before it is too late?\n\n\nP.S. on the side\n\nDo you think that Moses saw the God on mount Sina? Why would God go to top of the mountain? He created\nthe earth, he could have been anywhere? why on top the mountain? Was it because people thought to see God\nyou have to reach to the skies/heavens? Why God kept coming back to Middle East? Was it because they created\nGod through their imagination?  Is that why Jewish people were told by God, they were the chosen ones?\n\nProfit Mohammad was married to Khadijeh. She was a Jewish. She taught him how to trade. She probably taught\nhim about Judaism. Quran is mostly copy right of Taurah (sp? old testement). Do you think God wrote Quran?\nMakeh was a trade city before Islam. Do you think it was made to be the center of Islamic world because Mohammad\nwanted to expand his trade business? Is that why  God has put his house in there? \n\nI think this religious stuff has gone too far. All man kind are going to hurt from it if they do not wise up.\nLook at David Koresh, how that turned out? I am afraid in the bigger scale, the Jews and the Muslims will\nhave the same ending!!!!!!!!\n\nReligion is needed in the sense to keep people in harmony and keep them doing good things, rather than\nplotting each others distruction.

Answers to some frequently asked questions:\n \n Q: Why are the Montreal Canadiens called the Habs?\n A: Most of the team during the 40-50's was made up of people who lived in \nand around Montreal. Hence they were called \"Les Habitants\" (natives of \nMontreal). This was then shortened to the Habs.\n \n Q: Why is the Montreal Canadiens logo a large C with an H within it?\n A: In 1914-15, the Canadiens logo consisted of C with an A within it to \nsignify Club Athletique Canadien (CAC). The next year, CAC no longer \nexisted and it was changed to what it is now to signify Club de Hockey.\n\n Q: What is the most informative hockey publication?\n A: The Hockey News is preferred by most North American hockey fans. It is \na weekly journal with up-to-date info.\nPhone: 800-268-7793 (Canada and US)\nPhone/fax: 0483 776141 (UK and rest of Europe)\n \n Q: How does a 5-minute power-play count in the penalty killing stats in \nthe NHL?\n A: If X goals are scored, then the team gets credit for X goals in X+1 \nchances.\n \n Q: How is +/- computed in the NHL?\n A: First, +/- only applies to skaters. Except for a power-play goal, when \na goal is scored, each skater on the ice for the scoring team is given a \n+, and each skater on the ice for the other team is given a -. Short-\nhanded goals do count for +/-.\n \n Q: What is the five-hole?\n A: The space between a goalie's pads. There are five major scoring zones: \n(1) upper left corner of goal, (2) upper right, (3) lower left, (4) lower \nright, and (5) five-hole.\n \n Q: What is the meaning of throwing an octopus on the ice?\n A: This tradition began in Detroit in the 1950's when two best-of-seven \nseries were required to win the Stanley Cup. Every time Detroit won a \ngame, an octopus with one less arm was thrown on the ice.\n\n Q: Who was the first woman to play in an NHL game?\n A: Manon Rheaume, a 20-year-old goaltender, became the first woman ever \nto play in an NHL game on September 23, 1992 when she started in net for \nthe expansion Tampa Bay Lightning in an exhibition against the St. Louis \nBlues. Rheaume played the first period before 8,223 at the 10,400-seat \nExpo Hall on the Florida State Fairgrounds and allowed two goals on nine \nshots. She left with the score tied 2-2, although the Lightning ultimately \nlost the game, 6-4.\n\n Q: What is the richest contract in NHL history?\n A: Mario Lemieux, the superstar center of the Pittsburgh Penguins, signed \nthe richest contract in NHL history, a seven-year deal believed to be \nworth about $42 million. Lemieux will earn between $6 million and $7 \nmillion a year, nearly twice as much as any other player in the league.\n\n Q: Who is the new commissioner of the NHL?\n A: Gary Bettman, vice president and general counsel of the National \nBasketball Association, was named commissioner of the National Hockey \nLeague, Friday, December 11, 1992. Bettman joined the NBA in 1981 as \nassistant general counsel. He became the league's chief legal officer in \nSeptember of 1984. A New York resident, Bettman graduated from Cornell \nUniversity in 1974 and from New York University School of Law in 1977.\n\n Q: How many professional hockey leagues are there in North America?\n A: Six:  National, American, International, East Coast, Central and \nColonial Hockey Leagues.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n9. Miscellaneous:\n \n For field hockey discussions, go to the newsgroup rec.sport.hockey.field.\n For skating discussions, go to the newsgroup rec.skate.\n \n Some sites get another hockey group, called clari.sports.hockey. c.s.h \nconsists of the UPI feed for all UPI news articles that are related to \nhockey, including game results, summaries, scores, standings, etc.  Much \nof the information in the NHL team news section comes from this newsgroup.\n \n  The rec.sport.hockey Frequently Asked Questions posting is posted semi-\nmonthly, usually on the 1st and 15th of each month, during the hockey \nseason.  This file was originally created by Tom Wilson, who posted it \nduring the 1991-92 season.  It was taken over by Mitch McGowan for the \n1992-93 season.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n  Please make corrections via e-mail, indicating \"r.s.h FAQ\" as the \nsubject line.

{"messages":[{"role":"system","content":"You are a helpful assistant who can classify newsletters into the right categories."},{"role":"user","content":"I'm quite astonished, shocked, and appalled at this serious frontal \nassault on emerging American freedoms.  The Clinton administration \nnor any other government agency has any legitimate role whatsoever \nin regulating cryptography. To do so is tantamount to regulating \n`acceptable' speech, and is blatantly unconstitutional. Perhaps we \nshould rename this year `1984' in honor of such an illustrious \nproposal.  Let the Crappy Chip live in infamy, and the adminstration\nreceive great shame and discredit for this bizarre misadventure.\n\nI am outraged that my tax money is being used to develop technology\nto restrict my freedoms far beyond reasonable measures.  The U.S.\ngovernment will have my full uncooperation and disobedience on any\nserious threat to my liberties such as this, and I call on everyone\nwith an interest in a sensible government to resist and defy this \nproposal.  The administration does not seem to understand that they\nare merely a subservient instrument to implement the will of the\npublic, and hence anyone involved in this proposal in this respect is \nwholly negligent and remiss in performing their lawful duty.\n\n\nIt seems to me that U.S. Diplomatic communications should be \ntappable by the U.N. whenever any countries produce a warrant to\nthe U.N.  In fact, I think we should stop paying the NSA billions\nof dollars a year to produce unbreakable codes for this reason.\nThese actions violate the sovereignity of international law. (I hope\nMr. Clinton is shrewd enough to recognize my sarcasm and satire here.\nBut if he isn't, it's a modest and reasonable proposal, so he should\nfind merit with it nevertheless.)\n\nCryptography is neutral technology. If everybody has strong \ncryptography (including policemen, bureacrats, businessmen, \nhousewives, thugs and hoodlums), we have a sustainable \nequilibrium.  Anything less is an unworkable anti-egaltarian \narrangement, intrinsically antithetical to American freedoms, and\nguaranteed to collapse under its own weight of inherent \nimpracticality. We don't need to compromise on issues of freedom.\n\n\nFor too long our government has demonstrated itself to be \nincreasingly hostile and a serious obstacle to economic vitality \nand protecting Americans.\n\n\nIt is not possible for the Federal Government\nto ``act quickly'' or develop ``consistent, comprehensive\npolicies'' PERIOD.  And even if by some grandiose miracle such\na thing were possible, it would only be an efficient way to\ndeprive American citizens of fundamental and inalienable rights.\n\nThe administration has to be committed to leaving private \nindustries alone, esp. on this issue.  The government has no \nlegitimate role in regulating the content of communications.\nLaw enforcement agencies must be prepared to forfeit their\nsurveillance bludgeon; they are soon and inevitably to be \ndisarmed of it. \n\n\nNo such laws can be constitutionally sound, and this is equivalent\nto a veiled threat, which I don't appreciate.  This kind of \nextortion tends to agitate me and others into radicalism. I will\ntrade threats for threats, and violation for violation.\n\n\nIf the administration did say this, it would find itself \nimpeached for reckless and outrageous disregard of essential,\nestablished, entrenched, and explicit constitutional privacy \nguarantees. The administration would have no legal standing \nwhatsoever; such an action would be egregiously illegal and\ncriminal, and wholly untolerated and disregarded by vast \nsegments of the population.\n\n\nThe U.S., comprised of a vast majority of people fanatically \ncommitted to preserving their privacy in the face of an \nincreasingly totalitarian government, is saying just that.  \nTake your chips and give them to NSA employees as Christmas bonuses.\nWe can run any algorithm on our computers we damn well please, \nand we will make any chips we please, and we will send any bit \npattern over our data highways we please. And if you try to stop \nus, you will be gradually or abruptly dissolved into nothingness.\n\n[privacy vs. law enforcement]\n\nThis is an outright Dingaling Denning lie.  The two aims of\nprivacy and surveillance are intrinsically and fundamentally \nincompatible, and you have to work for the NSA to think otherwise. \nAmericans are about to discover ways, through the use of technology, \nto preserve their inalienable but forgotten freedoms that have slowly \nbeen eroded away by an increasingly distant and unresponsive and \n*unrepresentative* government.\n\n--"},{"role":"assistant","content":"sci.crypt"}]}

Unline Win3.1, it does not \nrun on top of DOS.  It is its own OS, with (Billy Gates assures us) true \nmulti-tasking/multithreading, meets DOD security specs, will run win3.1 \nprograms as well as DOS programs, has multi-processor support, and is\nprimarily a Server program.  It's overhead is too high for it to be\neconomical for most users.\n\tSpeaking of overhead, it requires at least a 386 with 16 megs of RAM.  \nIt iwll run with 12, but that's like running OS/2 2.0 with 4 megs.

It looks like what you would expect if you\nscanned the even fields (say) onto a sheet of mylar and had pinched the\nupper left corner with your fingers and started to tear it off the tube. \nWith proper composite sync (equalizing pulses) the interlace is rock\nsolid. \n"},{"role":"assistant","content":"sci.electronics"}]}

Generally, even if accidently inoculated, the normal\nimmune response should be enough to effectively handle the minimal contaminant \ninvolved with acupuncture needle insertion. \n\nMost acupuncturists use disposable needles...use once and throw away. They      \ndo this because you are not the only one concerned about transmission of \ndiseases via this route...so it's good business to advertise \"disposable needlesused here.\" These needles tend to be of a lower quality however, \nbeing poorly manufactured and too \"sharp\" in my opinion. They tend to snag bloodvessels on insertion compared to higher quality needles.                                                                        \nIf I choose to use acupuncture for a given complaint, that patient will get \ntheir own set of new needles which are sterilized between treatments.      \nThe risk here for hepatitis, HIV, etc. transmission is that I could mistakenly \nuse an infected persons needles accidently on the wrong              \npatient...but clear labelling and paying attention all but eliminates \nthis risk. Better quality needles tend to \"slide\" past vessels and            \nnerves avoiding unpleasant painful snags..and hematomas...so I use them.                        \nAcupuncture needles come in many lengths and thicknesses...but they are all \nsolid when compared to their injection-style cousins. In China, herbal solutionsand western pharmaceuticals are occasionally injected into \nmeridian points purported to have TCM physiologic effects and so require \nthe same hollow needles used for injecting fluid medicine. This means...thinkingtiny...that a samll amount of tissue, the diameter of the needle bore, will be \ninjected into the body as it would  be in a typical \"shot.\" when the skin is \npuntured. On the other hand when the solid \nacupuncture needle is inserted, the skin tends to \"squeeze\" the needle \nfrom the tip to the level of insertion such that any 'cooties' that \nhaven't been schmeared away with alcohol before insertion, tend to remain \non the surface of the skin minimizing invasion from the exterior. \n\nOf course in TCM...the body's exterior is protected by the Wei (Protective) Qi..so infection is unlikely....or in other words...there is a normal inflammatory \nand immune response that accompanies tissue damage incurred at the puncture \nsite.\n\n\nWhile I'm fairly certain your friend will not have a transferable disease \ntransmitted to them via acupuncture needle insertion, I would like to know for \nwhat complaint they have consulted the acupuncturist...not to know  if it would be harmful.. but to know if it would be helpful.

If you just look at attacks\non villages then there is no way of deciding when it started. Would you\ncount the riots in the 20's and 30's? Violence but not war. I personally\nthink that 'war', as opposed to civil disturbance or whatever, requires\norganisation, planning and some measure of regualr or semi-regular forces.\nPerhaps the Arab Liberation Army counts. I could easily be convinced it was\nso. From what I know they did not have a great deal of planning let alone\norganisation. The Haganah and Palmach certainly did. That is not a cause\nfor criticism, it merely reflects the great organisation generally in the\n'Zionist' camp.\n\n\nNow you are being silly aren't you? In any case the war did NOT start\nwith the invasion of the Arab Armies. You see we both agree on something.\nAnd the previous posters were wrong, no?\n\n\nAgain I am not sure, I doubt you want my opinion anyway, but I think\nwar requires organisation as I said before. It needs a group to command\nand plan. If Fatah lauches rockets from Southern Lebanon (and are you\nsure you have the right group - not the Moslems again?) then that sounds\nlike war to me. Stone throwing does not.\n\nJoseph Askew\n"},{"role":"assistant","content":"talk.politics.mideast"}]}

Paul thought it was.  Paul said, \n\"Knowing therefore, the terror of the Lord, we persuade men.\"\n\nToday, too much of our evangelism is nothing but soft soap and some of\nit is nothing but evangelical salesmanship.  We don't tell people anymore, that\nthere's such a thing as sin or that there's such a place as hell.  \n\nAs Jayne has said, this doesn't mean we have to come on so strong so as to hit\npeople over the head with a baseball bat.  Yet the fact remains, there is a\nplace called hell.  A place so fearful that God died to save us from having to\nexperience it.  Whatever you or I, as Christians, do, we should do whatever we\ncan to win people to the Lord, if for no other reason, to keep them from going\nto \"outer darkness.\".  \n\nJesus, in Mt. 25, tells us that He didn't prepare hell for people.  He prepared\nit for the Devil and his angels.  No where in the Bible do I read -anywhere,\nthat God predestined anybody to go to hell.  D.L. Moody use to say that the\nelect are the \"whosoever will\" and the nonelect are the \"whosoever wont's.\" \nWhether or not that's theologically sound, I couldn't defend, but its\npractical.  Jesus said to the people of Israel, \"Ye would not.\"  \n\nNow, some of you may not be students of the Bible, heck -some of you may not be\nChristians.  Have you ever said to somebody, \"I don't believe in hell.  I\nbelieve in the religion of Jesus.\"  But did you know that Jesus talked more\nabout hell than He did about heaven!  \"Oh I believe in the religion of the\nsermon on the mount.\"  You find hell taught by Jesus in the sermon on the\nmount.  You'll read that Jesus talked about the tree being cast into the fire. \nSeveral times he talks about hell and about judgment.  In fact, over and over\nin the synoptics, Matthew, Mark and Luke, Jesus talks about hell.  Not Isaiah. \nNot Moses.  Not John the Baptist, though he did, but Jesus, the Son of God. \nThe great Beloved One preached about hell because He loved people and didn't\nwant to see them go there.\n\nNow, if there is no hell then Jesus preached in vain.  It was our Lord Jesus,\nnot some angry Baptist preacher, that said, \"where the worm never dies, and\nwhere the fire never goes out.\"  Jesus said that.  It was Jesus who called hell\na \"furnace of fire.\"  It was Jesus that used the word, \"condemnation.\"  \"And\nthis is the condemnation, that men love darkness rather than light because\ntheir deeds are evil.  Jesus said that.  \n\nHow can we get it across to you that a loving, dying Jesus preached about hell?\n Not only that, but He went through hell.  That's what Calgary was all about. \nWhen my Lord was on the cross, darkness fell.  He called hell, \"outer\ndarkness.\"  \n\nDo you have this idea that hell is a place where the gamblers are gambling over\nhere, the drunks are getting drunk over there, and the prostitutes are\nprostituting their bodies over there?  That's not what hell is.  Hell's not a\nparty.  There's no fellowship there.  He called it \"outer darkness.\"  \"Outer\"\n-away from God.  \"Darkness\" -God is light.  \n\nNo when He was on the cross, He was made sin for you and for me.  God treated\nJesus the way sinners have to be treated.  That's is a sobering thought.  As my\nson would say, an \"awesome\" thought.  \n\n\"My God, My God why hast Thou forsaken me?\"  Hell is isolation.  There's no\nfellowship in hell.  There's no friendship in hell.  There's no loving embrace\nin hell.  There's no hand shake in hell.  There's no word of encouragement in\nhell.  \n\n\"I thirst.\"  It goes much deeper than physical thirst.  Hell is eternal craving\nwith no satisfaction.  The man whose life was lived for drugs, will crave it\neternally.  The man whose life was lived for the lust of a woman's body, will\ncrave it eternally -and not be satisfied.  One theologian has put it this way\nand I think it deserves merit.  What is hell?  Hell is just the kind of\nenvironment that matches the internal condition of the lost.  \n\nIn a recent post, I was trying to remember the founder of The Word of Life\nministries.  I've remembered his name, Jack Wertzen, and found that the\nillustration that I gave wasn't his.  His illustration was that he was talking\nto his barber and his barber's wife and daughter had just recently been saved\nand he was commenting about it to Jack.  \"They sing these songs and read Bible\nverses, and their praising this and that -I can't stand it!  Jack, do you think\nGod would send me to hell?\"  Jack answered by saying, \"Yes I think he would!\" \nOf course the barber said, \"What do you mean by that.\"  \"Well if you can't\nstand living at home with your wife and daughter who sing hymns and praises to\nGod now, what would you do in heaven where they'll do it for eternity?  You'd\nbe miserable.  Because God loves you, He'd put you where it would match what\nyou really are.\"   It makes a man think.\n\nThe crucifixion of Jesus Christ is a fact that necessitates the eternal\nexistence of hell because on the cross He performed an eternal act.  Don't ask\nme how, I don't know.  But He is God and He is the infinite/eternal and when He\ndied, He died an infinite/eternal death.  It is by that eternal act that He\npurchased eternal life for the \"whosoever wills.\"  He suffered eternal\njudgment.  \n\nA lot of people would like to detour around hell by saying \"Everybody is going\nto be saved eventually.\"  -universalism.  My Bible says no, He'll separate\nthem.  The sheep from the goats.  \".After you die there's a probationary period\nin which God prepares you for heaven.\"  No, my Bible says that \"It is appointed\nunto men once to die and then comes judgment.\"  Some of the cultist believe in\nannihilation.  After you die, sssswish.  Just like a mosquito you're squished\nout.  No, in Rev we are told that their is eternal existence in hell just as\nthere is in heaven.  \n\nI don't enjoy making these kind of statements and maybe you don't enjoy\nlistening to them, but we have to preach the entire Word of God.  -There is a\nplace called hell.  If I could give one verse of Scripture that could give any\nhope that people aren't going there, I'd give it to you, but I haven't found\nit.  That fact that there is a place called hell, the fact that our God is a\nGod of holiness and must judge sin, the fact that He has made us the kind of\ncreatures we are and therefore we're responsible, the fact that He has placed\nus in a \"uni\"verse that has purpose and design behind it, the fact that sin is\nsuch an awful thing and the fact that God Himself went through hell to save us\nfrom hell leads us to two applications.\n\n1)  As I've already mentioned.  If you are a Christian, you must worn others. \nIts not good enough to stop and fix their flat tire and not tell them that just\naround the bend the bridge is out.  \"Knowing therefore the terror of Lord, we\npersuade men.\"\n\n2)  If you haven't accepted Jesus are your Savior, you're taking an awful\nchance.  As I say to the Jehovah Witnesses (who no longer frequent my door), if\nyou are right and I am wrong, then I will have lived a good life and will die\nand cease to exist, but if I am right and you are wrong, then you will die and\nsuffer eternal damnation.  I don't mean to make fun at this point, but its like\nDirty Harry said, \"You've got to ask yourself, 'Do I feel lucky?'  Well do\nyou?\"  \"A man's got to know his limitations.\"  Don't be one of the \"whosoever\nwont's.\"  "},{"role":"assistant","content":"soc.religion.christian"}]}

It would be a strong incentive, as Vesselin points out, for more\npolice agencies to \"go rogue\" and try to get keys through more efficient\n\n   Q:   Suppose a law enforcement agency is conducting a wiretap on\n        a drug smuggling ring and intercepts a conversation\n        encrypted using the device.  What would they have to do to\n        decipher the message?\n\n   A:   They would have to obtain legal authorization, normally a\n                                                       ^^^^^^^^^^\n        court order, to do the wiretap in the first place.\n        ^^^^^^^^^^^\n\nThe clear implication is that there are \"legal\" authorizations other\nthan a court order.  Just how leaky are these?  (And who \nknows what's in those 7 pages that authorized the NSA?).  There\nmay well arise a black market of sorts _within_ police agencies, in which\nkeys are traded.  Furthermore, the police will be in an excellent\nposition to carry out this kind of thing without being caught.  They\nalready have a communication infrastructure with secure portions.  There\nare a few laws that I know of, that limit citizens' rights to access\npolice communications (or use the information they get).  It may be\nvery difficult to prove police misuse -- the fact that you have such\nevidence may itself be evidence that YOU have broken some other law.\n\nThrow in private detectives, who have even fewer policy/constitutional\nrestrictions.  Also consider mercenaries who've \"retired\" from intelligence\nagencies.  William Gibson must be loving it.  Great story material.\n\nDon't think it'll happen?  \n\nWell, consider e.g. the Michigan State Police, generally a very professional\norganization, which for years kept \"Red Files\" on thousands of suspected \ncommies, knowing full well it was not consititutional.  The standards\nof evidence were just about zero: people were in the file because they\nhappened to park near a place where, say, a US-China People's Friendship\nrally was happening -- the police went around writing down license\nplate numbers.  If you happened to be visiting a friend who lived near the \nmeeting place, well, the state police wound up filing you as a subversive.\n(They were eventually found out and a court ruled against carrying on any\nmore such nonsense.  I believe thay may have had to destroy the tapes\nas well.)\n\nEven with well-meaning cops (and I'm sure there are many), there will \nbe strong pressure to bend the constitutional safeguards.  We don't need\nto assume corrupt or unbalanced officers -- it will all be in the interest \nof enforcing sensible laws, saving lives, and protecting property.  \nCompromises will be made by well-meaning officers, facing what (to them) \nwill be a moral dilemma.\n\nClipper will make criminals out of cops.

{"messages":[{"role":"system","content":"You are a helpful assistant who can classify newsletters into the right categories."},{"role":"user","content":"Hello src readers,\n\nAgain the misconception that Copts among other Oriental Orthodox\nChurches believe in Monophysitism pops up again. We had a discussion\nabout it a while ago. \n\n\nThen OFM comments :\n\n\nWith my appreciation to the moderator, I believe that further elaboration\nis needed. This is an excerpt from an article featured in the first issue\nof the Copt-Net Newsletter :\n\nUnder the authority of the Eastern Roman Empire of Constantinople (as opposed\nto the western empire of Rome), the Patriarchs and Popes of Alexandria played\nleading roles in  Christian theology.  They were  invited everywhere to speak\nabout the Christian faith. St. Cyril, Pope of Alexandria, was the head of the\nEcumenical Council which was held in Ephesus in the year 430 A.D. It was said\nthat the bishops of the Church of Alexandria did nothing but spend  all their\ntime in meetings. This leading role, however, did not fare well when politics\nstarted to intermingle with  Church affairs.  It all started when the Emperor\nMarcianus interfered with matters of faith in the Church. The response of St.\nDioscorus, the Pope of Alexandria who was later  exiled, to this interference\nwas clear: \"You have nothing to do with the Church.\"  These political motives\nbecame even more  apparent in Chalcedon  in 451, when the Coptic  Church  was\nunfairly  accused of following  the  teachings of  Eutyches, who believed  in\nmonophysitism. This  doctrine maintains that the  Lord Jesus Christ  has only\none nature, the divine, not two natures, the human as well as the divine.\n\nThe Coptic  Church   has never  believed  in  monophysitism  the way   it was\nportrayed in the Council of Chalcedon!  In  that Council, monophysitism meant\nbelieving in one  nature.  Copts   believe that the Lord   is perfect in  His\ndivinity,  and He   is perfect in  His humanity,  but  His  divinity  and His\nhumanity were united in one nature called \"the nature of the incarnate word\",\nwhich was reiterated by St. Cyril of Alexandria.  Copts, thus, believe in two\nnatures \"human\" and   \"divine\"  that are   united in   one \"without mingling,\nwithout confusion, and without alteration\" (from the  declaration of faith at\nthe end of the Coptic divine liturgy).  These  two  natures \"did not separate\nfor a moment or the twinkling of an eye\" (also from  the declaration of faith\nat the end of the Coptic divine liturgy).\n\nThe  Coptic Church was  misunderstood in the 5th century  at the  Council  of\nChalcedon.  Perhaps the Council  understood   the Church correctly, but  they\nwanted to exile the  Church,   to  isolate it  and to  abolish the  Egyptian,\nindependent Pope. Despite  all of this,  the Coptic Church  has remained very\nstrict  and steadfast in its faith.   Whether it was   a  conspiracy from the\nWestern Churches to exile the Coptic Church  as a  punishment for its refusal\nto be politically influenced, or whether Pope Dioscurus  didn't  quite go the\nextra  mile to  make the  point that  Copts  are not  monophysite, the Coptic\nChurch has always felt a mandate  to reconcile \"semantic\" differences between\nall  Christian  Churches.   This is   aptly  expressed by the  current  117th\nsuccessor  of  St. Mark, Pope Shenouda III:  \"To the  Coptic Church, faith is\nmore  important  than  anything, and   others  must know that  semantics  and\nterminology are of  little importance to us.\"  Throughout this  century,  the\nCoptic Church has played  an important role  in the ecumenical  movement. The\nCoptic Church is one of the founders of the World Council of Churches. It has\nremained a member of that  council  since 1948 A.D.   The Coptic Church is  a\nmember  of the all  African Council of Churches  (AACC)  and the  Middle East\nCouncil of  Churches (MECC).  The Church    plays an  important role   in the\nChristian   movement   by   conducting dialogues   aiming  at  resolving  the\ntheological differences with the  Catholic, Greek Orthodox, Presbyterian, and\nEvangelical Churches.\n\n[...]\n\nAs a final note, the Oriental Orthodox and Eastren Orthodox did sign\na common statement of Christology, in which the heresey of Monophysitism\nwas condemned. So the Coptic Orthodox Church does not believe in\nMonophysitism.\n\nPeace,\n\nNabil\n\n          .-------------------------------------------------------------.\n         /  Nabil Ayoub                        ____/   __  /    ____/  /\n        /  Engine Research Center             /       /   /    /      /\n       /  Dept. of Mechanical Engineering    ___/    __  /    /      /\n      /  University of Wisconsin-Madison    /       /   |    /      /\n     /  Email:ayoub@erctitan.me.wisc.edu  _____/ __/   _|  _____/  /\n    '-------------------------------------------------------------'\n\n[As I mentioned in a brief apology, the comment quoted above from me\nis confused.  I appear to say that Nestorius was monophysite.  As\nAndrew Byler correctly stated it, the Nestorians and monophysites were\nactually opposite parties.  The point I was making, which Nabil\nexplains in some detail, is that some groups that have been considered\nheretical probably aren't.\n\nChalcedon was a compromise between two groups, the Alexandrians and\nAntiochenes.  It adopted language that was intended to be acceptable\nto moderates in both camps, while ruling out the extremes.  I agree\nthat there were extremes that were heretical.  However in the course\nof the complex politics of the time, it appears that some people got\nrejected who didn't intend heresy, but simply used language that was\nnot understood or even was mispresented.  And some seem not to have\njointed in the compromise for reasons other than doctrine.  There are\ngroups descended from both of the supposedly heretical camps.  This\nposting discussed the descendants of the Alexandrians.  There are also\na remaining Nestorians.  Like some of the current so-called\nmonophysites, there is reason to believe that the current so-called\nNestorians are not heretical either.  They sheltered Nestorius from\nwhat they saw as unfair treatment, but claim they did not adopt his\nheresies, and in fact seem to follow more moderate representatives of\nthe Antiochene tradition."},{"role":"assistant","content":"soc.religion.christian"}]}

All they\ncare about is wether or not what they are using is secure or not. That,\nafter all IS the bottom line. \n\n\tSecond, if I look at all the people I know who use any form\nof encryption at all, and this group spans people from the morons who\nstill insist that the DES is a good and secure standard, to people \nlooking at trying to improve upon existing strategies, I can not think\nof anyone of them who would approve blindly of a strategy that leaves\ntheir methods open to abuse. The Clipper does this, because people make\nmistakes by nature, and the US government is made up of people who are\njust as vulnerable to mistakes as everyone else. \n\n\tThird, since most of the people I know are at least marginaly\nfamiliar with the vulnerabilities present in current software encryption\nstratigies, I can't see how most of them are going to blindly trust that\nsomeone will not figure out a good way to compromise the Clipper Chip.\nThat despite any strengths or weaknesses that may exist in it. So, I can \nnot see a high degree of confidence developing in the chip.\n\n\tFourth, when it comes to criminal abuse, sure there are many stupid\npeople out there. And yes, some will be open to being caught via the \nbuilt in back door of the Clipper Chip. However, anyone who is going to\ndo any serious investigation of how best to secure their data is going\nto run into that problem pretty damned fast and, I would assume, start\nlooking around for other easily obtainible methods of encryption. \n\n\n\tIf nothing else were avalible, none of this would be an issue. However,\nthe truth is that most private encryption users that I've ever run into\nsimply do not give a damn about the legal status of RSA or PGP or anything\nelse. If it works, they use it. This is not going to change either. I do\nnot think for a moment that anyone with serious criminal intent will be\nslowed down by the advent of the Clipper Chip. It is all to easy to \nconvert encrypted data into unintellgible garbage as it is, if anything,\nthe Clipper Chip just adds another tool to the user.\n\n\n\tThe bottom line here is that people will use what works, and\nunavoidibly, I'm sure most criminals would rather face an encryption\nrelated charge than one which could potentialy lead to death penalty\ncharges in the case of criminals who murder as part of their conspiricy.\n\tThe other thing that has struck me since the advent and wide \nuseage of public encryption has begun is that quite simply the cat is\nout of the bag (Or if you have an interest in snooping, Pandora's Box\nhas been opened), and this is not going to change. I've seen a blindness\nto this that I've found utterly stunning, and the Clipper Chip, along\nwith the way it has been presented only confirms this to me to a larger\ndegree.\n\n\n\t\t\tSincerly,\n\n\t\t\tTim Scanlon\n\n-- "},{"role":"assistant","content":"sci.crypt"}]}

In comparison, in \nthe United States, reported cases of gonorrhea in 1992 continued an overall \ndecreasing trend (1). This report summarizes an analysis of the increase in \ngonorrhea in Colorado in 1992 and characterizes trends in the occurrence of \nthis disease from 1985 through 1992. \n     In 1992, 4679 cases of gonorrhea were reported to the Colorado Department \nof Health (CDH) compared with 3901 cases reported in 1991. During 1992, \nreported cases increased 22.7% and 17.5% among females and males, respectively \n(Table 1). Similar increases occurred among blacks, whites, and Hispanics \n(15.6%, 15.1%, and 15.9%, respectively); however, the number of reported cases \nwith race not specified increased 88% from 1991 to 1992 and constituted 9.7% \nof all reported cases in 1992. Although the largest proportional increases by \nage groups occurred among persons aged 35-44 years (80.4%) and greater than or \nequal to 45 years (87.7%), these age groups accounted for only 11.0% of all \nreported cases in 1992. Persons in the 15-19-year age group accounted for the \nlargest number of reported cases of gonorrhea during 1992 and the highest age \ngroup-specific rate (639 per 100,000). \n     Reported cases of gonorrhea increased 32.9% in the five-county Denver \nmetropolitan area (1990 population: 1,629,466) but decreased elsewhere in the \nstate (Table 1). Half the cases of gonorrhea in the Denver metropolitan area \noccurred in 8.4% (34) of the census tracts; these represent neighborhoods \nconsidered by sexually transmitted diseases (STDs)/acquired immunodeficiency \nsyndrome (AIDS) field staff to be the focus of gang and drug activity. \n     When compared with 1991, the number of gonorrhea cases diagnosed among \nmen in the Denver Metro Health Clinic (DMHC, the primary public STD clinic in \nthe Denver metropolitan area) increased 33% in 1992, and the number of visits \nby males to the clinic increased 2.4%. Concurrently, the number of cases \ndiagnosed among women increased by 1%. Among self-identified heterosexual men, \nthe number of gonorrhea cases diagnosed at DMHC increased 33% and comprised \n94% of all cases diagnosed in males, while the number of cases diagnosed among \nself-identified homosexual men remained low (71 and 74 in 1991 and 1992, \nrespectively). \n     Four selected laboratories in the metropolitan Denver area (i.e., HMO, \nuniversity hospital, nonprofit family planning, and commercial) were contacted \nto determine whether gonorrhea culture-positivity rates increased. Gonorrhea \nculture-positivity rates in three of four laboratories contacted increased \n23%-33% from 1991 to 1992, while the rate was virtually unchanged in the \nfourth (i.e., nonprofit family planning). \n     From 1985 through 1991, reported cases of gonorrhea among whites and \nHispanics in Colorado decreased; in comparison, reported cases among blacks \n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 14\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\n\nincreased since 1988 (Figure 1). During 1988-1992, the population in Colorado \nincreased 9.9% for blacks, 9.8% for Hispanics, and 4.5% for whites. In 1992, \nthe gonorrhea rate for blacks (1935 per 100,000 persons) was 57 times that for \nwhites (34 per 100,000) and 12 times that for Hispanics (156 per 100,000) \n(Table 1). Among black females, reported cases of gonorrhea increased from \n1988 through 1992 in the 15-19-year age group; among black males, cases \nincreased from 1989 through 1992 in both the 15-19-and 20-24-year age groups. \n\nReported by: KA Gershman, MD, JM Finn, NE Spencer, MSPH, STD/AIDS Program; RE \nHoffman, MD, State Epidemiologist, Colorado Dept of Health.

Surveillance and Information Systems Br, \nDiv of Sexually Transmitted Diseases and HIV Prevention, National Center for \nPrevention Svcs, CDC. \n\nEditorial Note: The increase in reported gonorrhea cases in Colorado in 1992 \nmay represent an overall increase in the occurrence of this disease or more \ncomplete reporting stimulated by visitations to laboratories by CDH \nsurveillance staff during 1991-1992. The increases in confirmed gonorrhea \ncases at DMHC and in culture-positivity rates in three of four laboratories \nsuggest a real increase in gonorrhea rather than a reporting artifact. \nHowever, the stable culture-positivity rate in the nonprofit family planning \nlaboratory (which serves a network of clinics statewide) indicates that the \ngonorrhea increase did not uniformly affect all segments of the population. \n     One possible explanation for the increased occurrence of gonorrhea in \nColorado may be gang- and drug-related sexual behavior, as implicated in a \nrecent outbreak of drug-resistant gonorrhea and other STDs in Colorado Springs \n(2). Although the high morbidity census tracts in the Denver metropolitan area \ncoincide with areas of gang and drug activity, this hypothesis requires \nfurther assessment. To examine the possible role of drug use -- implicated \npreviously as a factor contributing to the national increase in syphilis (3-6) \n-- the CDH STD/AIDS program is collecting information from all persons in whom \ngonorrhea is diagnosed regarding drug use, exchange of sex for money or drugs, \nand gang affiliation. \n     The gonorrhea rate for blacks in Colorado substantially exceeds the \nnational health objective for the year 2000 (1300 per 100,000) (objective \n19.1a) (7). Race is likely a risk marker rather than a risk factor for \ngonorrhea and other STDs. Risk markers may be useful for identifying groups at \ngreatest risk for STDs and for targeting prevention efforts. Moreover, race-\nspecific variation in STD rates may reflect differences in factors such as \nsocioeconomic status, access to medical care, and high-risk behaviors. \n     In response to the increased occurrence of gonorrhea in Colorado, \ninterventions initiated by the CDH STD/AIDS program include 1) targeting \npartner notification in the Denver metropolitan area to persons in groups at \nincreased risk (e.g., 15-19-year-old black females and 20-24-year-old black \nmales); 2) implementing a media campaign (e.g., public service radio \n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 15\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\n\nannouncements, signs on city buses, newspaper advertisements, and posters in \nschools and clinics) to promote awareness of STD risk and prevention targeted \nprimarily at high-risk groups, and 3) developing teams of peer educators to \nperform educational outreach in high-risk neighborhoods. The educational \ninterventions are being developed and implemented with the assistance of \nmembers of the target groups and with input from a forum of community leaders \nand health-care providers. \n\nReferences\n\n1.

Child safety seats and safety \nbelts can substantially reduce this loss (2). From 1977 through 1985, all 50 \nstates passed legislation requiring the use of child safety seats or safety \nbelts for children. Although these laws reduce injuries to young children by \nan estimated 8%-59% (3,4), motor-vehicle crash-related injuries remain a major \ncause of disability and death among U.S. children (1), while the use of \noccupant restraints among children decreases inversely with age (84% usage for \nthose aged 0-4 years; 57%, aged 5-11 years; and 29%, aged 12-18 years) (5). In \naddition, parents who do not use safety belts themselves are less likely to \nuse restraints for their children (6). To characterize the association between \nadult safety-belt use and adult-reported consistent use of occupant restraints \nfor the youngest child aged less than 11 years within a household, CDC \nanalyzed data obtained from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System \n(BRFSS) during 1988 and 1989. This report summarizes the findings from this \nstudy. \n     Data were available for 20,905 respondents aged greater than or equal to \n18 years in 11 states * that participated in BRFSS -- a population-based, \nrandom-digit-dialed telephone survey -- and administered a standard Injury \nControl and Child Safety Module developed by CDC. Of these respondents, 5499 \n(26%) had a child aged less than 11 years in their household. Each respondent \nwas asked to specify the child's age and the frequency of restraint use for \nthat child. The two categories of child restraint and adult safety-belt use in \nthis analysis were 1) consistent use (i.e., always buckle up) and 2) less than \nconsistent use (i.e., almost always, sometimes, rarely, or never buckle up). \nData were weighted to provide estimates representative of each state. Software \nfor Survey Data Analysis (SUDAAN) (7) was used to calculate point estimates \nand confidence intervals. Statistically significant differences were defined \nby p values of less than 0.05. \n     Each of the 11 states had some type of child restraint law. Of these, six \n(Arizona, Kentucky, Maine, Nebraska, Rhode Island, and West Virginia) had no \nlaw requiring adults to use safety belts; four (Idaho, Maryland, Pennsylvania, \nand Washington) had a secondary enforcement mandatory safety-belt law (i.e., a \nvehicle had to be stopped for a traffic violation before a citation for nonuse \nof safety belts could be issued); and one state (New York) had a primary \nenforcement mandatory safety-belt law (i.e., vehicles could be stopped for a \nsafety-belt law violation alone). In nine states, child-passenger protection \n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 17\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\n\nlaws included all children aged less than 5 years, but the other two states \nused both age and size of the child as criteria for mandatory restraint use. \nThe analysis in this report subgrouped states into 1) those having a law \nrequiring adult safety-belt use (law states), and 2) those without such a law \n(no-law states). \n     Overall, 21% of children aged less than 11 years reportedly were not \nconsistently restrained during automobile travel. Both child restraint use and \nadult restraint use were significantly higher (p less than 0.05, chi-square \ntest) in law states than in no-law states (81.1% versus 74.3% and 58.7% versus \n43.2%, respectively). \n     High rates of restraint use for children aged less than or equal to 1 \nyear were reported by both adults indicating consistent and less than \nconsistent safety-belt use (Figure 1). Adults with consistent use reported \nhigh rates of child-occupant restraint use regardless of the child's age \n(range: 95.5% for 1-year-olds to 84.7% for 10-year-olds). In comparison, for \nadults reporting less than consistent safety-belt use, the rate of child-\noccupant restraint use declined sharply by the age of the child (range: 93.1% \nfor 1-year-olds to 28.8% for 10-year-olds). When comparing children of \nconsistent adult safety-belt users with children of less than consistent adult \nsafety-belt users, 95% confidence intervals overlap for the two youngest age \ngroups (i.e., aged less than 1 and 1 year). \n     Reported child-occupant restraint use in law states generally exceeded \nthat in no-law states, regardless of age of child (Table 1). In addition, \nhigher adult educational attainment was significantly associated with \nincreased restraint use for children, a factor that has also been associated \nwith increased adult safety-belt use (8). \n\nReported by: National Center for Injury Prevention and Control; National \nCenter for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion, CDC. \n\nEditorial Note: The findings in this report are consistent with others \nindicating that adults who do not use safety belts themselves are less likely \nto employ occupant restraints for their children (6,9). Because these \nnonbelted adults are at increased risk of crashing and more likely to exhibit \nother risk-taking behaviors, children traveling with them may be at greater \nrisk for motor-vehicle injury (10). \n     Educational attainment of adult respondents was inversely associated with \nchild restraint use in this report. Accordingly, occupant-protection programs \nshould be promoted among parents with low educational attainment. Because low \neducational attainment is often associated with low socioeconomic status, such \nprograms should be offered to adults through health-care facilities that serve \nlow-income communities or through federal programs (i.e., Head Start) that are \ndirected at parents with young children. \n     Injury-prevention programs emphasize restraining young children. In \naddition, however, efforts must be intensified to protect child occupants as \n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 18\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\n\nthey become older. Parents, especially those with low educational attainment, \nthose who do not consistently wear safety belts, and those from states that do \nnot have mandatory safety-belt use laws, should be encouraged to wear safety \nbelts and to protect their children by using approved child safety seats and \nsafety belts. Finally, the increased use of restraints among children may \nincrease their likelihood of using safety belts when they become teenagers -- \nthe age group characterized by the lowest rate of safety-belt use and the \nhighest rate of fatal crashes (5). \n\nReferences\n\n1.

The \nprevalence estimates for 44 diagnostic categories were based on data for 1983-\n1988 for 639,837 births in California and 152,970 births in metropolitan \nAtlanta. The prevalences in the two areas were compared, adjusting for race, \nsex, and maternal age by using Poisson regression. \n     Results: Regional differences in the prevalence of aortic stenosis, fetal \nalcohol syndrome, hip dislocation/dysplasia, microcephalus, obstruction of the \nkidney/ureter, and scoliosis/lordosis may be attributable to general \ndiagnostic variability. However, differences in the prevalences of arm/hand \nlimb reduction, encephalocele, spina bifida, or trisomy 21 (Down syndrome) are \nprobably not attributable to differences in ascertainment, because these \ndefects are relatively easy to diagnose. \n     Interpretation: Regional differences in prenatal diagnosis and pregnancy \ntermination may affect prevalences of trisomy 21 and spina bifida. However, \nthe reason for differences in arm/hand reduction is unknown, but may be \nrelated to variability in environmental exposure, heterogeneity in the gene \npool, or random variation. \n     Actions Taken: Because of the similarities of these data bases, several \ncollaborative studies are being implemented. In particular, the differences in \nthe birth prevalence of spina bifida and Down syndrome will focus attention on \nthe impact of prenatal diagnosis.

Throughout the season increases in the indices \nof influenza morbidity in regions where influenza A(H1N1) predominated were \nsimilar to increases in regions where influenza B predominated. Only 7% of \nidentified viruses were influenza A(H3N2), but isolations of this subtype \nincreased as the season waned, and it subsequently predominated during the \n1989-90 season. During the 1988-89 season outbreaks in nursing homes were \nreported in association with influenza B and A(H3N2) but not influenza \nA(H1N1). \n     Interpretation: The alternating temporal and geographic predominance of \ninfluenza strains A(H1N1) and B during the 1988-89 season emphasizes the \nimportance of continual attention to regional viral strain surveillance, since \namantadine is effective only for treatment and prophylaxis of influenza A. \n     Actions Taken: Weekly interim analyses of surveillance data produced \nthroughout the season allow physicians and public health officials to make \ninformed choices regarding appropriate use of amantadine. CDC's annual \nsurveillance allows the observed viral variants to be assessed as candidates \nfor inclusion as components in vaccines used in subsequent influenza seasons. \nAuthors: Louisa E.

Together, \nthese technologies are referred to as the high-tech assisted reproductive \ntechnology (ART) procedures. \n\nOvulation induction, sperm insemination and surgery for tubal disease and/or \npathology still are the mainstays of the therapies available for infertility \nmanagement. However, when these fail, it almost always is appropriate to \nproceed with one of the ART procedures. \n\nTherefore, in addition to a comprehensive basic and general infertility \nservice at The University of Arizona Center for Reproductive Endocrinology and \nInfertility, there is a program of Assisted Reproduction that specializes in \nART procedures. This program serves as a tertiary provider for those patients \nin the state of Arizona whose infertility problems cannot be resolved by the \ntraditional therapies. \n\nThe following article (on back) describes the ART procedures available in our \nCenter, clarifies appropriate applications for each, and considers the \nrealistic expectations for their success. Procedures included are: \n\no in vitro \no fertilization - embryo transfer (IVF-ET),  gamete intrafallopian tube \n  transfer \no (GIFT),  cryopreservation of human embryos and  gamete micromanipulation. \nThis article also considers ongoing research in our program that is directed \ntowards improved success of these technologies. \n\n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 24\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\n\n                           Future Areas of Research\n\nIn addition to ongoing research that is directed exclusively toward the \nmanagement of infertile couples, we are developing the technology to assist \ncouples who are at risk for producing embryos with a serious hereditary \ndisease. \n\nThis technology involves biopsying the preimplantation human embryo and then \nsubjecting the biopsied cells to genetic analysis using either DNA \namplification or fluorescent in situ hybridization. \n\nThere are recent reports of the successful application of DNA amplification by \nother centers, for example, for diagnosis of the genes for cystic fibrosis and \nhemophilia. We hope to apply and further focus fluorescent in situ \nhybridization technology for probing the X chromosome, the identification of \nwhich will provide a scientific basis for counselling patients who exhibit \nsex-linked disorders. \n\nThe considerable clinical application of such technology lies in the fact that \nit circumvents the need for prenatal diagnosis, in addition to the possibility \nof a subsequent termination of affected fetuses, in order to avoid the birth \nof affected children. \n\n\nCatherine Racowsky, Ph.D.\nAssociate Professor and Director of Research\nDepartment of Obstetrics and Gynecology\nCollege of Medicine \nUniversity of Arizona\nTucson, Arizona\n\n               Applications, Success Rates and Advances for the\n                           Management of Infertility\n\nThe following are the ART procedures available at The University of Arizona \nCenter for Reproductive Endocrinology and Infertility. \n\n     In Vitro Fertilization - Embryo Transfer is the core ART procedure of our \nAssisted Reproduction Program.  This procedure involves retrieval of \nunfertilized eggs from the ovary, their insemination in vitro in a dish, and \nthe culture of resultant embryos for 1 or 2 days, before they are transferred \nto the patient's uterus. All cultures are maintained in an incubator under \nstrictly controlled atmospheric and temperature conditions. Before being \nprocessed for use in insemination, semen samples are evaluated in our \nandrology laboratory using both subjective light microscopy and computer-\n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 25\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\n\nassisted semen analyses. To ensure an adequate number of eggs with which to \nperform IVF-ET, or indeed, GIFT, follicular development is typically \nstimulated, with gonadotropins (perganol, metrodin), gonadotropin releasing \nhormone (GnRH, Factrel, lutrepulse) and/or GnRH analogues (lupron, Depo \nlupron, synarel). Occasionally, however, IVF-ET is accomplished with eggs \nobtained in non-stimulated cycles. While some programs utilize laparoscopic \negg retrieval in the operating room with the patient under general anesthesia, \nwe undertake the less costly approach of ultrasound-guided retrieval in our \nInfertility Unit, with the patient sedated.  \n     Couples who resort to IVF-ET exhibit such pathologies as tubal \ndeficiencies, ovulatory dysfunction, endometriosis, and/or mild forms of male \nfactor infertility.  According to the United States IVF Registry, the overall \nsuccess rate for IVF-ET nationwide has stabilized at about 14 percent per \ncycle. Results from our program, involving 86 patients who have undergone 173 \nIVF-ET cycles, reflect a comparable success rate. \n     Nevertheless, the overall incidence of success with this procedure is \ndisconcertingly low and emphasizes the need to address those physiological \nfactors that limit achievement of a higher percentage of pregnancies.  Well \nrecognized predictors of outcome include patient age, response to exogenous \novarian stimulation, quality of sperm and number of repeated IVF-ET cycle \nattempts. However, among these, age is the single most significant determinant \nof conception. Therefore, it is critical that such patients are referred to an \nAssisted Reproduction Program at the earliest opportunity following failure of \ntraditional therapies. \n     The underlying basis for the negative effect of age on fertility has not \nbeen clearly delineated beyond recognition that: 1) the number of eggs \navailable for retrieval declines markedly with age; 2) fertilization rates \nsignificantly decrease in eggs retrieved from patients who are over 40 years; \nand 3) provided the appropriate hormonal background is present, age is \nunrelated to uterine competency to sustain pregnancy. Ongoing research in our \nCenter, therefore, is investigating physiological changes in the egg that may \nbe impacted by age. We have determined that more than 50 percent of eggs that \nfail to fertilize in vitro are chromosomally abnormal, and that a significant \nproportion of these abnormalities are accountable to patient age. Currently, \nthe only recourse for such patients is to use eggs obtained from a donor. Our \nprogram has initiated recruitment of volunteer egg donors to satisfy the needs \nof a list of recipients interested in this form of therapy. \n\n     GIFT - This high-tech ART procedure is performed in the operating room, \nusually with the use of a laparoscope and, in contrast to IVF-ET, involves \nintroducing sperm and freshly retrieved eggs into the lumen of the Fallopian \ntube (an average of 3 eggs/tube). Under these circumstances, fertilization \noccurs in vivo and, if excess eggs are retrieved, the remainder undergo IVF, \nwith subsequent options for embryo transfer in that cycle, or freezing for \ntransfer in a subsequent cycle. This ART procedure is applied to cases in \n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 26\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\n\nwhich there is at least one patent Fallopian tube but the couple has such \npathologies as ovulatory dysfunction, endometriosis, male factor infertility \nand/or idiopathic infertility.    \n     The data reported in the United States IVF Registry for 1985 through 1990 \nindicate that the overall success rate with GIFT is higher than that obtained \nwith the IVF-ET technique (range of clinical pregnancies for GIFT is 24 to 36 \npercent and for IVF-ET 14 to 18 percent). In view of this fact, one might \nexpect more patients to be treated with GIFT than IVF-ET. However, in our \nprogram we have taken into account three basic concerns which, while \nsubstantially reducing the number of GIFT cycles performed, benefit the \npatient. These concerns are: 1) the increased costs associated with performing \na procedure in the operating room; 2) the risks, albeit minimal, of undergoing \ngeneral anesthesia; and 3) the considerable benefits to be accrued from \nobtaining direct information on the quality and fertilizability of the eggs, \nand the developmental competency of resultant embryos. \n     The increased success with GIFT undoubtedly reflects the artificial \nenvironment provided by the laboratory in the IVF-ET procedure. Between \nJanuary 1, 1991, and December 31, 1992, we have performed a total of 12 GIFT \ncycles, with an overall success rate of 20 percent. \n     Embryo cryopreservation, or freezing, is applied in our program when \nembryos result from residual GIFT eggs or from non-transferred IVF embryos. \nThis procedure not only provides patients with a subsequent opportunity for \nsuccess at much reduced costs, but also circumvents the legal and ethical \nissues relating to disposal of supernumerary embryos. Therefore, as stipulated \nby the American Fertility Society ethical guidelines for ART programs, from \nboth a practical and an ethical standpoint, all Assisted Reproduction programs \nshould have the capability of cryopreserving human embrys. \n     Gamete Micromanipulation - This ART procedure, which is still very new, \nis applied to couples who are unaccepting of insemination with donor semen but \nwho have severe male factor infertility (less than 10 million sperm/ml in \ncombination with fewer than 20 perccent motile sperm, and/or less than 10 \npercent sperm with normal morphology). We are currently developing the \nprocedure of sub-zonal insertion (SZI), which entails injecting sperm under \nthe coating around the egg, the barrier normally penetrated by the sperm \nthrough enzymatic digestion. \n     Available data from SZI programs world-wide indicate that only 5 to 10 \npercent of SZI cycles result in a pregnancy. This statistic undoubtedly \nrelates to limitations imposed by abnormalities inherent in the sperm. \nTherefore, we are currently focusing on the development of improved techniques \nfor the recognition and selection of sperm chosen for manipulation. Such \nefforts are unquestionably worthwhile in view of the fact that this technology \noffers the only realistic opportunity for severe male factor patients to \nestablish conception. \n\nCatherine Racowsky, Ph.D.\n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 27\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\n\nAssociate Professor and Director of Research\nDepartment of Obstetrics and Gynecology\nCollege of Medicine \n--------- end of part 2 ------------\n"},{"role":"assistant","content":"sci.med"}]}

This stance\nmakes it difficult to discuss other faiths with them and my own\nhesitations about Christianity because they see no other way.\nTheir way is the 'truth.'\n\nBut I see their faith arising from a willful choice to believe\na particular way.  That choice is part faith and part reason,\nbut it seems to me a choice.\n\nMy discussions with some Christians remind me of schoolyard\ndiscussions when I was in grade school:\n\nA kid would say, \"All policemen are jerks!\"  I'd ask, \"How do\nyou know?\"  \"Because my daddy told me so!\"  \"How do you know\nyou're daddy is right?\"  \"He says he's always right!\"\n\nWell the argument usually stops right there.  In the end,\naren't we all just kids, groping for the truth?  If so, do we have\nthe authority to declare all other beliefs besides our own as\nfalse?\n\n-------------\n\nThis is only my third time browsing through this newsgroup.  I\napologize if I'm covering tired old ground.  Some of the\ndiscussions on this topic have piqued my interest and I welcome\nany comments.\n\n-- \n\n[I'm sort of mystified about how a Christian might respond to this.  I\ncan understand criticisms of Christianity that say there's not enough\nevidence to believe it, or that there's just as good evidence for\nother religions.  I don't agree, but clearly there are plenty of\nintelligent people who don't find the evidence convincing.  But that\ndoesn't seem to be your point.  Rather, you seem upset that people who\nbelieve Christianity is true also believe that things which contradict\nit are false.\n\nThis suggests a model of spiritual things that's rather different than\nthe Christian one.  It sounds more like an existentialist view, where\npeople choose what value to follow, but there's no actual independent\nspiritual reality, and so no way to say that a specific choice is in\nsome unique sense right.  This sort of model -- with modifications of\none sort or another -- may be appropriate for some religions.  But\nChristianity is in its essense a \"historical\" religion.  That is, it's\nbased on the concept that there are actual spiritual entities out\nthere, that one of them has intervened in history in specific ways,\nand that we see evidence of that in history.  In the \"mundane\" world,\nwe are not free to choose how things work.  When we drop something, it\nfalls (aside from well-defined situations where it doesn't).  The\nChristian concept is that spiritual matters, there is also an actual\nexternal reality.  I hope we're all honest enough not to claim that we\nhave perfect understanding.  But while we may not think we know\neverything, we are confident that we know some things.  And that\nimplies that we think things that contradict them are false.  I don't\nsee how else we could proceed.\n\nThis needn't result in arrogance.  I'm certainly interested in talking\nwith people of other religions.  They may have things to teach me, and\neven if they don't, I respect them as fellow human beings.  But it's\ngot to be possible to respect people and also think that on some\nmatters they are wrong.  Maybe even disasterously wrong."},{"role":"assistant","content":"soc.religion.christian"}]}

{"messages":[{"role":"system","content":"You are a helpful assistant who can classify newsletters into the right categories."},{"role":"user","content":"First, I would like to say how much I appreciate having so literate and\nerudite an individual as Mr. Rutledge with whom to discuss this topic.\nFrankly, most anti-RKBA posters refuse even to approach the topic of\nthe original understanding of the Bill of Rights as detailed in the\nwritings of the era. This  is most refreshing.\n\nSecond, I must apologize for leaving the discussion for several days.\nMy brigade's quarterly drill was this weekend and I needed to attend\nto several matters pertaining to the State Militia.\n\nSome people seem to feel that the concept of the Militia is an anachro-\nnism that is out of place in the 20th century. I'm not sure the Swiss\nwould agree and I think perhaps a discussion of how the Militia, both\norganized and unorganized, fits into the defense plans of my State,\nMississippi. Please do not assume that this describes something peculiar\nto one southern state. For instance, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts\nhas a well organized Militia which, members report, maintains stocks\nof both riot guns and machine guns. The laws of other States will vary\nbut are probably similar.\n\nTitle 35  of Mississippi Code defines our Militia as \"all able-bodied\ncitizens of the state between the ages of seventeen (17) and sixty-\ntwo (62) years...\". The Militia is divided into 3 classes: The National\nGuard, the Mississippi State Guard and the unorganized Militia.  The\nNational Guard is a strange sort of fish from a Constitutional perspective.\nIt tries to be both State Militia and Federal Reserve. The discussion\nof this \"para-constitutional\" arrangement is quite interesting in itself\nbut somewhat beyond the scope of this discussion. Suffice it that, at this\ndate, the National Guard has ceased to have any Constitutional standing\nas anything but a Federal reserve force.\n\nMississippi, and most other States, maintains a purely State organized\nMilitia. In Mississippi this is called The State Guard. In other \nStates it may be called something else. The State Guard exists as\na cadre or training corps made up of mostly experienced officers and\nsenior NCOs who serve as volunteers without compensation. We drill\non a monthly basis at the company and battalion level, brigade once\na quarter and have an annual drill of the whole organization. Our\nState-authorized cadre strength is 694. This is a skeleton of an\norganization without any flesh. The muscle and sinew when needed will\ncome from the unorganized Militia.\n\nIn time of invasion, insurrection or calamity the Governor can order\nthe activation of the State Guard. When this takes place a call will\nfirst be made  for volunteers to fill the organization out to either\nits contingency strength of 2194 or full strength of 4910. In the\nevent that a sufficient number of people fail to volunteer, the law\nprovides detailed instructions for the conducting of a draft of the\nunorganized Militia. The size of the State Guard is not specified by\nlaw, but rather by executive order. At one time, the organized Militia\nof Mississippi consisted of 68 regiments. Needless to say, the State\ndoes not have armories brimming with weapons with which to equip such\na force. The historical precedent for arming such a force is by use\nof mostly the private arms of the Militiamen. \n\nIt is my hope that demonstrates that State Militias are far from being\nthe long dead anachronisms that some may wish to claim.\n\n\nRegarding Hamilton: If you take Hamilton's opinion as being the sole\nrepresentative of the opinions of the Founding Fathers, you will have\nchosen a highly skewed sample set. Hamilton was on the extreme Federalist\nend of the political spectrum. Others, such as Coxe and Henry, can\nbe chosen to represent the other end. Many contemporaries felt that\nthe idea of having a standing Army of any sort or even a select Militia\nor \"train bands\" were contrary to the egalitarian nature of the govern-\nment they were striving to perfect. The compromise reached was to\nprovide for a small Army, which had to be refinanced every two years,\nand iron-clad protection for the Militia, which was to remain ever,\n\"terrible and irresistible\".\n\nThese protections included: State control, not Federal; limitation\nof Federal utilization of the Militia (i.e. execute Laws, suppress\nInsurrections and repel Invasions), and the Right to Keep and Bear\nArms to prevent what the British had tried to do at Lexington.\nThese limitations eventually proved so onerous to the Federal Govern-\nment that they were skirted by the creation of the National Guard.\n\nThe National Guard was created for one very simple reason: the \nConstitutional Militia was had proved too unreliable for fighting\nwars of imperial expansion. (e.g. Spanish-American War). The\nConstitution provided that the Militia could only be employed by\nthe Federal government in very limited purposes. As far back as the\nWar of 1812, Militia units had refused to leave United States\nterritory to attack the enemy. Further, there was no Constitutional\nauthorization for any conscription of anyone into the Federal\nMilitary and Militiamen were particularly protected. In all wars until\nWW-I every American who left the country under arms was a volunteer.\nWhen the National Guard acts of 1903-1916 required that each new\nmember also enlist as a reservest in the Army, existing soldiers were\n\"grandfathered\". At least one of these \"grandfathered\" individuals\nrefused to go to France in 1918 and his refusal was upheld by the\nFederal Courts.\n\nMr. Rutledge has stated that the Second Amendment applies only to\nmembers of a \"well organized\" militia. However, the pre-Constitutional\nhistory of the American Militia shows relatively few periods when\nThe Militia came close to meeting either Messrs. Rutledge or Hamilton's\ndefinition of \"well organized\". In the period of peace between the\nFrench & Indian War and The Revolution many companies simply stopped\ndrilling and had to be reconstituted just prior to The Revolution.\nPerhaps Mr. Rutledge would care to argue that those of my ancestors\nwho answered the Lexington alarm had forfeited their rights because\ntheir units didn't drill for a few years in the 1760s. I would not\nbe so bold.\n\nAgain, I wish to repeat. The National Guard, for all its merits, is\nnot the Militia described by the Constitution  nor by Mr. Hamilton\nnor by Mr. Henry nor by Mr. Coxe. The fact that the Federal Government\nand many States are delinquent in their attentions to and organizing\nof their Constitutional Militias  diminishes neither their\nresponsibilities nor the rights of the Militia as detailed in the\nConstitution.\n \nMisunderstanding of the nature and purpose of the Militia is but one\nerror that has crept into modern readings of the Constitution. The\nConstitution prohibits States from keeping \"Troops or Ships of War\nin time of Peace\". I have heard some insist this prevents States from\nmaintaining a Militia, but this comes about because people today do not\nunderstand the meanings of the words in their 18th century usage.\nToday we call any large vessel a \"ship\" but in the 18th century the word\ndescribed a particular kind of vessel.  A \"ship\" is a large vessel with\nthree or more masts each carrying square rigged sails. A \"brig\" has two\nmasts. In the contemporary usage the States were prohibited only from keeping\nthe largest warships of the day, those capable of global operations. Today's\nequivalent might be a prohibition on the States' keeping nuclear missiles.\n\"Troops\" at this time meant a full-time professional military organization.\nAny study of contemporaneous writings will bear this out. \n\nIn at least one respect, I am in agreement with Mr. Rutledge; being\npersonally involved in the maintenance and advancement of The Militia\nas a viable means of defense for a modern society, I am frequently\nboth bemused and saddened when friends and associates wax poetic on\ntheir place in the unorganized Militia and become strangely silent or\nscarce when invited to attend a  drill of their State's Militia."},{"role":"assistant","content":"talk.politics.guns"}]}

One of his best throwaway lines was to\nremind us that all of us holders of carry permits there had been\nchecked and certified clear of all crimes by the state; while the\npeople in the Statehouse behind us only had to be certified clean of\n\"election fraud\" to hold their jobs.\n\nNancy Snow and Amos Hamburger were busy handing out ID buttons and\nsheets describing all the bills to be presented at the hearings, and\ntelling people where to find their own representatives (and in too\nmany cases, who they were).\n\nMike warned us that the committee was going to suspend its rules and\ndiscuss a bill that hadn't made it onto the official list.  It seems a\ndelegation of students from Simon's Rock of Bard College (alma mater\nof Wayne Lo, who shot up the place with an SKS late last year) was\nbeing bussed in to testify for a bill to ban all sales of firearms or\nammo to anyone who is not a state resident.\n\nThe hearings were originally scheduled in the (large) Gardner\nAuditorium at 10:30, but that had been pre-empted by the Governor's\nhearings on the Framingham Eight (women in prison for killing abusive\nhusbands, and seeking release).  So we had until 1:30 to buttonhole\nour representatives, after which we would be squashed into an\ninadequate hearing room.\n\nOne of my representatives' staffers was somewhat offensively smarmy.\nHe said, \"Oh, it must be gun hearings day again!  The gun lobby is\nalways so organized every year.\"  I got a little pissed, and replied,\n\"I'm not from the gun lobby -- I'm from your district.\"\n\nAt 12:30, your second reporter arrived in time to notice a\ndemonstration going on in front of the statehouse (where the\npro-gunners weren't).  Randy Price from the TV News was there, in his\nmirror reflective shades, talking to one of the anti-gun types, and\nseveral Simon's Rock anti-gun \"close-the-loophole\" protestors.\n(Earlier, Randy had covered the GOAL rally.)\n\nThe room we had been assigned seated about 50.  Remember, there were\nabout 160 gun owners there, plus another 20-30 students and teachers\nfrom Bard.  One of us had already reserved a seat; the other never got\ncloser than the atrium outside -- and there was a crowd behind HIM.  A\ncop took up station at the entrance and prevented the rest of the\ncrowd from coming in.  Soon after the debate started, a loudspeaker\nwas set up outside in the hall for the benefit of everyone else.\n\nEveryone who was there (inside and outside) got to sign up on a sheet\nsaying what their position was on which bills.  Most of us signed up\nto \"support GOAL's position\" on \"all bills.\"\n\nFirst, because of their time constraints, public officials got to\ntestify.  And first up was the bill that nobody had seen (the students\nhad some curfew, I guess).  \n\nCurrently, Massachusetts law allows a non-resident to purchase long\nguns or ammo from a local dealer provided he complies with the laws of\nhis own state.  Previously, the law was similar, but applied only to\nnon-residents from states adjoining Massachusetts.  The Simon's Rock\nfolks called the current law a \"loophole\" and wanted it closed.\n\nTwo of their reps spoke about Wayne Lo and his \"SKS assault rifle.\"\nThe second one, Hodgekiss, a co-sponsor, had done his homework so well\nthat he kept confusing Montana (Wayne Lo's home state) with Missouri,\nand became belligerent when about five gun owners in the gallery\ncorrected him after his second muff.  Carr, from Gloucester, claimed\nthat the new bill would put the law back the way it was, but he was\nlying: the new bill allows purchases by non-residents of adjoining\nstates ONLY if they have licensing in their own state \"as strong as\"\nthat in Massachusetts.  Since none of them do, that's that.\n\nSome of the things these two said were really offensive.  \"In some of\nthese other states, anyone can buy a gun as long as he's breathing!\"\n(Oooooo!)  \"We have some very, very good gun laws in Massachusetts; if\nonly the other states would adopt the same type of laws, we wouldn't\nbe having this situation -- but they won't.\"  (Naughty, naughty!)\n\nNext up was Boston city councilman Albert \"Dapper\" O'Neill.  He was\nthere to testify pro-gun, but in some ways he was a liability.  He's\nreasonably elderly and tends to wander and repeat himself, plus he's\nalmost a caricature of a law-n-order politician.  He badmouthed the\nACLU, said violent criminals should be executed, and that if he were\njudge, he'd give arrestees their \"last rights\" (pun intended) on the\nspot (at which many of the gun owners applauded, which bothered me.)\nHe said that all the proposed gun restrictions were a step in the\nright direction -- for the criminals.  He said this FOUR times :-(\n\nTwo of the bills under consideration would allow police to rescind a\nCCW or FID, and confiscate all your guns, if someone had filed a\nrestraining order against you.  (Note that the filing of a restraining\norder requires no warrant, no hearing, no evidence, and no conviction\n-- just an accusation.)  Senator Barrett of Reading testified in favor\nof it, and patronized the pro-gunners there several times by saying,\n\"I'm sure all the gun owners here will agree with me that we have to\nget these weapons out of the hands of people that our courts have\nconvicted.\"  I haven't seen such a disgustingly disingenuous\nperformance since Nixon whined that he wasn't a crook.\n\nBarrett also spoke in favor of the bill making the FID card renewable\nevery five years, instead of permanent as it is now.  The stated\npurpose is to remove FID cards from those who have become ineligible.\n\"Revenue has nothing to do with it.\"  (Yeah, right.)  Apparently, some\ncongressmen think we're stupid enough to swallow the argument that\nit's preferable to process 1.6 million renewals every cycle in the\nvague hope of catching a recent felon than to simply take the goddamn\ncard away from a criminal at conviction time.  As usual, hassle the\nlaw-abiding instead of the crook.\n\nThe two co-chairs of the committee were Rep. Caron and Sen. Jujuga.\nJujuga didn't say much (he was a co-sponsor of both \"restraining\norder\" bills) but Caron struck me as a sharp guy that wouldn't let any\nbad logic or lies on the part of either side to go unchallenged.  (He \nwas a co-sponsor of one of the \"restraining order\" bills as well.)  One\nof the younger reps on the committee (forgot his name) was\nvociferously pro-gun, somewhat embarrassingly so.  His heart was in\nthe right place, but his arguments seemed to be confined to, \"every\nyear it's the same damn thing, you come in here with this crap...\"\nIt's nice to have a friend on the committee, but he could have been\nmore effective.\n\nAt about 3:00, it was clear that the hall-jam couldn't continue.\nSomeone came out of another meeting hall and yelled at the cop because\nthe loudspeaker was disturbing their meeting, so the loudspeaker was\ndisconnected.  So they found a bigger hall upstairs.  One of us had\nto leave to catch his charter bus, and so missed the \"public\"\ntestimony; the other got a seat this time.\n\nCaron began by talking about how he got his FID 16 years ago, left the\nstate, and then returned without notifying them of his address change.\nHe complained that the state record system was not up-to-date and that\nhis PD back in his city of birth still thought he lived there.  Great\nquote: \"If you purchase a gun today, it will not get into the state\ncomputer system until 1999.\"  (This was also an argument he used\nagainst the renewable FID card.)\n\nTestimony was heard from several \"battered women,\" one of whom had\nbeen attacked by some guy in his 20's who had an FID card because he\ngot it when he was 15 or thereabouts.  They used a lot of emotion and\nsaid how they were scared of these men.  A staffer of Attorney General\nHarshbarger testified in favor of this anti-gun bill, saying how\n50,000 restraining orders were granted last year, and how these women\nneeded to be protected.  Caron noted that a restraining order was\ngranted for 10 days, and then a hearing was held to determine whether\nthe order would be extended to a year.  He asked whether she would be\nsatisfied if the FID were revoked at the time of this hearing rather\nthan after the initial issuance of the FID.  She gave some long\nrambling circumlocution in response.\n\nThen testimony against the bill was heard.  Mike Yacino (who looks\nsomething like Einstein) got up and made the point that restraining\norders were issued on too little evidence, that judges like to issue\nrestraining orders just to let things cool off no matter who they\nthink is right (man or woman), and that the hearings for restraining\norders are lightning sessions with little time to consider facts.\nAtty. Karen McNutt spoke with him a few times during his testimony.\n\nOther pro-gunners got up to testify.  One said he had had to file a\nrestraining order against a tenant to clear her out, and that she\ncountered by filing one against him!  He noted that this would have\nallowed the state to confiscate his guns if the new bill became law.\nOne of the junior reps noted that \"this is America\" and we have to be\ncertain that individual rights are respected.  Senator Jujuga\nreiterated this, saying that \"people who abuse smaller people can go\nto Hell as far as I care, but we have to be careful about equating\nconviction with a restraining order.\"  (Point and match, Senator.)\n\nAnother pro-gunner got up and testified that he didn't know his\ncitizenship \"expired every 5 years,\" and that a driver's license was a\nprivilege, not a right like the right to keep and bear arms.\n\nA third got up and said the problem was with the criminal justice\nsystem, and argued in favor of a death penalty bill and public\nhangings.  Senator Jujuga said he had himself tried to get a death\npenalty bill passed, and joking responded that he, too, favored public\nhangings.  The speaker then responded, \"I'll make you a deal.  You get\nme the rope, and I'll tie the noose.\"\n\nNext came public testimony on the Simon's Rock bill.  A teacher\ntestified that she had been the teacher of Wayne Lo, and that \"he\nwouldn't have been able to shoot people inside a building while he was\noutside\" without his evil gun.  She said that the \"loophole\" should be\nclosed to prevent something like this from \"ever happening again\".\n\nFour or five other kids testified in favor of this bill, one of\nspilling tears for the good legislators.  One of the students actually\nshot by Wayne Lo was also there.  Many of them had T shirts on,\nsaying, \"As long as one person can buy a gun in anger, none of us are\nsafe -- support gun control.\"  The committee was reluctant to grill or\ncorrect the kids, except for Caron, who corrected one student who had\nclaimed that anyone could apply for an FID.  \"Only residents can get\nFID's,\" he said.  (How much do you want to bet that this kid had no\nidea he had been conned into testifying for a bill that would cut\nout-of-staters completely off?)\n\nYacino and McNutt spoke again, this time noting that the bill as\nwritten would affect both ammo AND ALL guns possessed by\nout-of-staters.  Karen also noted that hunters in CT, NH, and VT could\nbe put away for a year if they wandered across the MA boundary\nsomewhere in the woods and got challenged by game wardens.  Yacino\nunderscored the fact that Lo COULD have gotten an FID as a resident\nstudent -- and, hell, even an CCW, as he had NO criminal or mental\nrecord.\n\nOne junior rep was upset that it would take MA residents longer to buy\na gun than out-of-staters, and thought it was \"elitist\".  Another\n(Caron?) said that we need the protection of preventing non-residents\nfrom buying without an FID because only two other states in the union\nhad \"FID-type\" cards, so complying with all the laws of one's home\nstate was \"not enough.\"  One pro-gun speaker replied that this\nresembled a mother watching her son in a marching band and exclaiming,\n\"Everyone's out of step but Johnny!\"\n\nAll the Bard College people were filing out as the pro-gun testimony\nfor this bill was made, and thus only pro-gunners were around when the\nother bills came under consideration.  The main bills remaining (and\nGOAL's position) were:\n\no  H.4375 and four others: Notify police chiefs so they can pull \n   licenses when a holder is convicted (strongly supported)\n\no  H.1732: Require trigger locks on all handguns sold (opposed)\n\no  H.962: Require trigger locks on all loaded firearms (strongly\n   opposed)\n\no  H.1350: Allow every municipality to enact their own gun laws \n   (opposed)\n\no  H.1731: Fund bullet-proof vests for municipal police (supported)\n\no  S.1097: State Constitutional Amendment for the RKBA (supported)\n\no  Several on police discretion in the issuance of FID cards (opposed)\n\no  Several altering non-resident license conditions (supported)\n\no  H.1135: Ban damn near all guns everywhere in the state (guess!)\n\nSome of these took only 30 seconds to consider, as the remaining\npro-gunners raised hands in unison either for or against them.\n\nMike Yacino noted that, besides the danger in screwing with a trigger\nlock on a loaded gun, that bill would make it illegal for a licensee\nto carry his concealed handgun unless it were locked.\n\nCaron blew right through H.1350 when he saw that we opposed it.\nAgain, he brought up the state's archaic records capability and said,\n\"This would create hundreds of different licensing systems.\"\n\nThe session ran late -- since it was the last scheduled hearing, it\ncould not be adjourned until everyone who wanted to had testified.  It\nended at about 6:30.\n-- "},{"role":"assistant","content":"talk.politics.guns"}]}
