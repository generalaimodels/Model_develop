What happens is that the inside of my throat starts\nto feel \"puffy\", like I have a cold, and also at times the inside of my\nmouth (especially the tongue) and lips also feel puffy.\n\nThe situations around these symptoms almost always involve restaurants\n(usually chinese), the most notable cases:  a cheap chinese fast food\nchain, a japanese steak house (I had the steak), and another chinese\nfast food chain where I SAW the cook put about a tablespoon or two of\nwhat looked like sugar or salt into my fried rice.\n\nI am under the impression that MSG \"enhances\" flavor by causing the\ntaste buds to swell.  If this is correct, I do not find it unreasonable\nto assume that high doses of MSG can cause other mouth tissues to swell.\n\nAlso, as the many of the occurances (including two of the above)\ninvolved beef, and as beef is frequently tenderized with MSG, this is\nwhat I suspect as being the cause.\n\nI wouldn't be at all surprised if toxicity studies of MSG in animals\nshowed it as being harmless, as it would be very startling to hear a lab\nrat or rhesus monkey complain about their throats feeling funny.\n\nAnyone who wishes to explain how the majority of food additives are\ntotally harmless is welcome to e-mail me with the results of any studied\nthey know of.

The alternative approach (to CISC),\n which has been adopted by many in\n recent years, has come to be known as \"RISC\": the Reduced\n Instruction Set Computer.

(A ``block\n  cipher'' just means a cipher that encrypts a block of data---8 bytes,\n  say---all at once, then goes on to the next block.) The notion of\n  product ciphers is due to Shannon [SHA49]. Examples of modern\n  product ciphers include LUCIFER [SOR84], DES [NBS77], SP-networks\n  [KAM78], LOKI [BRO90], FEAL [SHI84], PES [LAI90], Khufu and Khafre\n  [ME91a]. The so-called Feistel ciphers are a class of product\n  ciphers which operate on one half of the ciphertext at each round,\n  and then swap the ciphertext halves after each round. LUCIFER,\n  DES, LOKI, and FEAL are examples of Feistel ciphers.\n\n  The following table compares the main parameters of several product \n  ciphers:\n\n  cipher   |   block length   |   key bits   |   number of rounds\n  LUCIFER          128               128                16\n  DES               64                56                16\n  LOKI              64                64                16\n  FEAL              64               128            2^x, x >= 5\n  PES               64               128                 8\n\n* What makes a product cipher secure?\n\n  Nobody knows how to prove mathematically that a product cipher is\n  completely secure. So in practice one begins by demonstrating that the\n  cipher ``looks highly random''. For example, the cipher must be\n  nonlinear, and it must produce ciphertext which functionally depends\n  on every bit of the plaintext and the key. Meyer [MEY78] has shown\n  that at least 5 rounds of DES are required to guarantee such a\n  dependence. In this sense a product cipher should act as a ``mixing''\n  function which combines the plaintext, key, and ciphertext in a\n  complex nonlinear fashion.\n\n  The fixed per-round substitutions of the product cipher are\n  referred to as S-boxes. For example, LUCIFER has 2 S-boxes, and DES\n  has 8 S-boxes. The nonlinearity of a product cipher reduces to a\n  careful design of these S-boxes. A list of partial design criteria\n  for the S-boxes of DES, which apply to S-boxes in general, may be\n  found in Brown [BRO89] and Brickell et al. [BRI86].\n\n* What are some group-theoretic properties of product ciphers?\n\n  Let E be a product cipher that maps N-bit blocks to N-bit blocks.\n  Let E_K(X) be the encryption of X under key K. Then, for any fixed K,\n  the map sending X to E_K(X) is a permutation of the set of N-bit\n  blocks. Denote this permutation by P_K. The set of all N-bit\n  permutations is called the symmetric group and is written S_{2^N}.\n  The collection of all these permutations P_K, where K ranges over all\n  possible keys, is denoted E(S_{2^N}). If E were a random mapping from\n  plaintexts to ciphertexts then we would expect E(S_{2^N}) to generate\n  a large subset of S_{2^N}.\n\n  Coppersmith and Grossman [COP74] have shown that a very simple\n  product cipher can generate the alternating group A_{2^N} given a\n  sufficient number of rounds. (The alternating group is half of the\n  symmetric group: it consists of all ``even'' permutations, i.e., all\n  permutations which can be written as an even number of swaps.)\n  Even and Goldreich [EVE83] were able to extend these results to show\n  that Feistel ciphers can generate A_{2^N}, given a sufficient number\n  of rounds.\n\n  The security of multiple encipherment also depends on the\n  group-theoretic properties of a cipher. Multiple encipherment is an\n  extension over single encipherment if for keys K1, K2 there does\n  not exist a third key K3 such that\n\n  E_K2(E_K1(X)) == E_(K3)(X)                (**)\n\n  which indicates that encrypting twice with two independent keys\n  K1, K2 is equal to a single encryption under the third key K3.  If\n  for every K1, K2 there exists a K3 such that eq. (**) is true then\n  we say that E is a group.\n\n  This question of whether DES is a group under this definition was\n  extensively studied by Sherman, Kaliski, and Rivest [SHE88]. In their\n  paper they give strong evidence for the hypothesis that DES is not a\n  group. In fact DES is not a group [CAM93].\n\n* What can be proven about the security of a product cipher?\n\n  Recall from above that P_K is a permutation produced by E under\n  some key K. The goal of the designer of E is to ensure that P_K\n  appears to be a random element of S_{2^N}, the symmetric group.\n  Let R be an element of S_{2^N} selected randomly. We will say that P_K\n  and R are indistinguishable if an observer given P_K and R in some\n  order cannot distinguish between these two permutations in polynomial\n  time. That is, with time bounded resources, the observer cannot\n  determine which of the permutations is produced by E: the optimal\n  decision is no better than simply guessing.\n\n  Luby and Rackoff [LUB88] have shown that a class of Feistel ciphers\n  are secure in this sense when the round mapping is replaced by\n  random boolean functions.\n\n* How are block ciphers used to encrypt data longer than the block size?\n\n  There are four standard \"modes of operation\" (and numerous non-standard\n  ones as well).  The standard modes of operation are defined in the U.S.\n  Department of Commerce Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) 81,\n  published in 1980.  See the question about \"ECB\" below for more details.\n\n  Although they are defined for the DES block cipher, the \"modes of\n  operation\" can be used with any block cipher.\n\n* Can symmetric block ciphers be used for message authentication?\n\n  One may use a symmetric cryptosystem block cipher to prove to himself\n  that he did or did not generate a message, and to prove to himself \n  whether his message was altered or unaltered since generation.  But one\n  cannot prove these things to another without revealing the key, and \n  thereafter that key cannot be used to prove anything about any messages\n  that were authenticated using that key.\n  \n  See ANSI X3.106-1983 and FIPS 113 (1985) for a standard method of message\n  authentication using DES.\n\n* What exactly is DES?\n\n  DES is the U.S. Government's Data Encryption Standard - a product \n  cipher that operates on 64-bit blocks of data, using a 56-bit key.  \n\n  It is defined in FIPS 46-1 (1988) [which supersedes FIPS 46 (1977)].\n  FIPS are Federal Information Processing Standards published by NTIS.\n  DES is identical to the ANSI standard Data Encryption Algorithm (DEA)\n  defined in ANSI X3.92-1981. \n\n* What is triple DES?\n\n  Triple DES is a product cipher which, like DES, operates on 64-bit \n  data blocks.  There are several forms, each of which uses the DES\n  cipher 3 times.  Some forms use two 56-bit keys, some use three.\n  The \"DES modes of operation\" may also be used with triple-DES.\n\n  Some people refer to E(K1,D(K2,E(K1,x))) as triple-DES.\n\n  This method is defined in chapter 7.2 of the ANSI standard X9.17-1985\n  \"Financial Institution Key Management\" and is intended for use in\n  encrypting DES keys and IVs for \"Automated Key Distribution\".  Its\n  formal name is \"Encryption and Decryption of a Single Key by a Key\n  Pair\", but it is referenced in other standards documents as EDE.\n\n  That standard says (section 7.2.1): \"Key encrypting keys may be a single\n  DEA key or a DEA key pair.  Key pairs shoud be used where additional\n  security is needed (e.g., the data protected by the key(s) has a long\n  security life).  A key pair shall not be encrypted or decrypted using a\n  single key.\"\n\n  Others use the term \"triple-DES\" for E(K1,D(K2,E(K3,x))) or\n  E(K1,E(K2,E(K3,x))).\n\n  One of us (Carl Ellison) keeps advocating DES triple use in the form\n  E(K1, TRAN( E(K2, TRAN( E(K3, COMPRESS( x )))))), where each DES instance\n  has its own key and IV (for CBC mode) and TRAN has been posted on\n  sci.crypt.  (It is a large-block transposition program taking its key\n  from the data stream itself, so that it is not an encryption program on\n  its own part.)\n\n* What is differential cryptanalysis?\n\n  Differential cryptanalysis is a statistical attack that can be\n  applied to any iterated mapping (ie. any mapping which is based on\n  a repeated round function). The method was recently popularized by\n  Biham and Shamir [BIH91], but Coppersmith has remarked that the\n  S-boxes of DES were optimized against this attack some 20 years ago.\n  This method has proved effective against several product ciphers,\n  notably FEAL [BI91a].\n\n  Differential cryptanalysis is based on observing a large number of\n  ciphertexts Y, Y' whose corresponding plaintexts X, X' satisfy a\n  known difference D = X+X', where + is componentwise XOR. In the\n  basic Biham-Shamir attack, 2^{47} such plaintext pairs are required\n  to determine the key for DES. Substantially fewer pairs are required\n  if DES is truncated to 6 or 8 rounds. In these cases, the actual key\n  can be recovered in a matter of minutes using a few thousand pairs.\n  For full DES this attack is impractical because it requires so many\n  known plaintexts.\n\n  The work of Biham and Shamir on DES revealed several startling\n  observations on the algorithm. Most importantly, if the key\n  schedule was removed from DES and a 16*48 = 768-bit key was used,\n  the key could be recovered in less than 2^{64} steps. Thus\n  independent subkeys do not add substantial security to DES.\n  Further, the S-boxes of DES are extremely sensitive in that\n  changing even single entries in these tables yields significant\n  improvement in the differential attack.\n\n  Adi Shamir is quoted to say (NYTimes Oct 13 1991), ``I would say\n  that, contrary to what some people believe, there is no evidence\n  of tampering with the DES so that the basic design was weakened.''\n\n* How was NSA involved in the design of DES?\n\n  According to Kinnucan [KIN78], Tuchman, a member of the group that\n  developed DES at IBM is quoted as saying, ``We developed the DES\n  algorithm entirely within IBM using IBMers. The NSA did not\n  dictate a single wire!'' Tuchman and Meyer (another developer of\n  DES) spent a year breaking ciphers and finding weaknesses in\n  Lucifer. They then spent two years strengthening Lucifer. ``Their\n  basic approach was to look for strong substitution, permutation,\n  and key scheduling functions ... IBM has classified the notes\n  containing the selection criteria at the request of the NSA....\n  `The NSA told us we had inadvertently reinvented some of the deep\n  secrets it uses to make its own algorithms,' explains Tuchman.''\n  \n  On the other hand, a document called ``Involvement of the NSA in\n  the development of DES: unclassified summary of the United States\n  Select Committee on Intelligence'', printed in the IEEE\n  Communications Magazine, p53-55, 1978, states: ``In the development\n  of DES, NSA convinced IBM that a reduced keysize was sufficient;\n  indirectly assisted in the development of the S-box structures; and\n  certified that the final DES algorithm was, to the best of their\n  knowledge, free from any statistical or mathematical weakness.''\n\n  Clearly the key size was reduced at the insistence of the NSA.\n  The article further states that the NSA did not tamper with the\n  algorithm itself, just the parameters, which in some sense\n  resolves the apparent conflict in the remarks of Meyer and Tuchman\n  presented above.\n\n* Is DES available in software?\n\n  Several people have made DES code available via ftp (see part 10 for\n  pathnames): Stig Ostholm [FTPSO]; BSD [FTPBK]; Eric Young [FTPEY];\n  Dennis Furguson [FTPDF]; Mark Riordan [FTPMR]; Phil Karn [FTPPK].\n  A Pascal listing of DES is also given in Patterson [PAT87].\n\n  FIPS 46-1 says \"The algorithm specified in this standard is to be\n  implemented ... using hardware (not software) technology.  ...\n  Software implementations in general purpose computers are not in\n  compliance with this standard.\"  Despite this, software\n  implementations abound, and are used by government agencies.\n\n* Is DES available in hardware?\n\n  The following paragraphs are quoted from messages sent to the editors.\n  We don't vouch for the quality or even existence of the products.\n\n  encryption/decryption device for use on standard, digital 64Kbps PCM\n  telecom data streams.

In my\nencounters with Christians, I find myself dismayed by their\nbelief that their faith is total truth.  According to them,\ntheir beliefs come from the Bible and the bible is the word of\nGod and God is truth - thus they know the truth.  This stance\nmakes it difficult to discuss other faiths with them and my own\nhesitations about Christianity because they see no other way.\nTheir way is the 'truth.'\n\nBut I see their faith arising from a willful choice to believe\na particular way.  That choice is part faith and part reason,\nbut it seems to me a choice.\n\nMy discussions with some Christians remind me of schoolyard\ndiscussions when I was in grade school:\n\nA kid would say, \"All policemen are jerks!\"  I'd ask, \"How do\nyou know?\"  \"Because my daddy told me so!\"  \"How do you know\nyou're daddy is right?\"  \"He says he's always right!\"\n\nWell the argument usually stops right there.  In the end,\naren't we all just kids, groping for the truth?  If so, do we have\nthe authority to declare all other beliefs besides our own as\nfalse?\n\n-------------\n\nThis is only my third time browsing through this newsgroup.  I\napologize if I'm covering tired old ground.  Some of the\ndiscussions on this topic have piqued my interest and I welcome\nany comments.\n\n-- \n\n[I'm sort of mystified about how a Christian might respond to this.  I\ncan understand criticisms of Christianity that say there's not enough\nevidence to believe it, or that there's just as good evidence for\nother religions.  I don't agree, but clearly there are plenty of\nintelligent people who don't find the evidence convincing.  But that\ndoesn't seem to be your point.  Rather, you seem upset that people who\nbelieve Christianity is true also believe that things which contradict\nit are false.\n\nThis suggests a model of spiritual things that's rather different than\nthe Christian one.  It sounds more like an existentialist view, where\npeople choose what value to follow, but there's no actual independent\nspiritual reality, and so no way to say that a specific choice is in\nsome unique sense right.  This sort of model -- with modifications of\none sort or another -- may be appropriate for some religions.  But\nChristianity is in its essense a \"historical\" religion.  That is, it's\nbased on the concept that there are actual spiritual entities out\nthere, that one of them has intervened in history in specific ways,\nand that we see evidence of that in history.  In the \"mundane\" world,\nwe are not free to choose how things work.  When we drop something, it\nfalls (aside from well-defined situations where it doesn't).  The\nChristian concept is that spiritual matters, there is also an actual\nexternal reality.  I hope we're all honest enough not to claim that we\nhave perfect understanding.  But while we may not think we know\neverything, we are confident that we know some things.  And that\nimplies that we think things that contradict them are false.  I don't\nsee how else we could proceed.\n\nThis needn't result in arrogance.  I'm certainly interested in talking\nwith people of other religions.  They may have things to teach me, and\neven if they don't, I respect them as fellow human beings.  But it's\ngot to be possible to respect people and also think that on some\nmatters they are wrong.  Maybe even disasterously wrong."},{"role":"assistant","content":"soc.religion.christian"}]}

Catholics have always called our Church \"Holy Mother Church\"\nand our \"Mother.\"  An example would be from St. Cyprian of Carthage, who\nwrote in 251 AD, \"Can anyone have God for his Father, who does not have\nthe Church for his mother?\"\n\tHence the image of the Church as a woman, holding a Cross and a Cup,\nwhich tell of the Crucifxition of Our Lord, and of the power of His\nBlood (the grail legend, but also, more significantly, it shows that\n\"This is the Cup of the New Covenant in my blood, which shall be shed\nfor you and for many.\" (Luke 22.20), the Cup represents the New Covenant\nand holds the blood of redemption).  The fact that the woman is holding\nboth and is said to have the whole world for her seat, is that the\nCatholic Church is catholic, that is universal, and is found throughout\nthe world, and the Church shows the Crucifixtion and applies the blood\nof redemption to all mankind by this spread of hers, thorugh which the\nHoly Sacrafice of the Mass, can be said and celebrated in all the\nnations as Malachi predicted in Malachi 1.11, \"From the rising of the\nsun to its setting, my name is great among the gentiles, and everywhere\nthere is sacrafice, and there is offered to my Name a clean oblation,\nfor my Name is great among the gentiles, says the Lord of hosts.\"  And\nso we acknowledge what St. Paul wrote \"For as often as you eat this\nbread and drink this cup, you show the Lord's death until he comes.\" (1\nCorinthians 11.26)\n\n\tYou are quite right about the identification of \"Babylon the Great,\nMother of all Harlots\" with Rome.  I think we simply disagree as to what\ntime period of Rome the Apostle John is talking about."},{"role":"assistant","content":"soc.religion.christian"}]}

EDT\n\n\t     \n\t     THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you very much.  The speech that \nOctavius gave says more than anything I will be able to say today \nabout why it's important to give all of our young people a chance to \nget a work experience and to continue to learn, to merge the nature \nof learning and work; why it's important to honor the efforts of \npeople like Jerry Levin and Nancye Combs and Pat Irving and all of \nthose who are here.  \n\t     \n\t     I want to thank the Secretaries of Labor and Education \nand all the people who work with them for sponsoring this; and my \ngood friend, Governor Wilder, for being here and for speaking; and \nall of the business and local community leaders from the city and \ncounty and state level from around America who are here. \n\t     \n\t     This has been a pretty fun day.  (Laughter.)  I loved \nhearing the young people sing.  It was music to my ears because it is \ntheir future that we are really struggling about.  (Applause.)  A \nyear and a half ago I began the quest to seek the presidency because \nI was concerned about their future.  Because I believe that our \ncountry, which had always been a beacon of hope for the young, had \ntoo little opportunity, was too divided among ourselves across lines \nof income and race and region and other ways, without a vision to \ntake us into the future.  \n\t     \n\t     I entered with the hope that together we could create \nmore opportunity and insist on much more responsibility from all of \nour people.  But in the process we might recreate the best of \nAmerica's community, knowing that together we could always to more \nthan we could individually and that we might secure our future.\n\t     \n\t     All of you here today are committed to that.  The 1,000 \njobs that Jerry Levin has committed Time-Warner to is symbolic of the \ncommitments made by many of the private sector people who are here, \nand those who are around the country.  The work that Nancye Combs \ndoes, and the successes of all the young people like those on this \nstage, and especially the eloquent statement Octavius Jeffers -- all \nthose things show that together we know what we need to do, and we're \non the right track.\n\t     \n\t     Last July when I was traveling across America's \nheartland in my luxurious bus, I visited Seneca High School in \nLouisville, Kentucky.  And there I met young people and business \npeople who were participating in the Louisville Education and \nEmployment Partnership.  I saw what Nancye Combs talked about today.  \nI saw how the young people were making an extra effort to succeed \nboth in school and at work.  I saw, as I have seen many times in my \nown state, the principle illustrated that Octavius has talked about \n-- that for millions of American young people it is really an \nimpediment to both their learning and their ability to be good \nworkers to draw a sharp dividing line between what is work and what \nis learning.\n\t     \n\t     In the world in which we are living, the average young \nperson will change the nature of work seven or eight times in a \nlifetime.  We must learn to merge the work world and the learning \nworld much better.  And we must determine that all of our young \npeople see the opportunities that some of them have had showcased \nhere today.  \n\t     \n\t     Whether you're in business or in government or in \neducation, you know that we have a big job to do when it comes to \nbuilding a future that really, honestly includes opportunity for all \nof our people.  There are still a lot of people who say, well, things \nare pretty good here in Washington and everything's fine; the best \nthing we can do about this whole thing is nothing.  They all have \njobs.  (Laughter.)  All the people who say that.  (Applause.)  \n\t     \n\t     They all have health insurance.  They all have a pretty \ngood education.  And they all have a pretty secure knowledge that \nthey'll be okay no matter what happens.  I say that not to be either \npolitical or unduly critical, but to point out that one of the great \nchallenges of this age for every advanced nation -- everyone -- is to \nfully develop the capacities of all of its people, and then find work \nfor them to do.\n\t     \n\t     All the European countries have higher unemployment \nrates than we do, but also stronger support systems for the \nunemployed.  The Japanese unemployment rate has been going up.  \nThey're going to adopt a stimulus that, even if you count it in its \nmost rigorous terms, is three or four times bigger than the one that \nI have proposed to create jobs. \n\t     \n\t     In West Germany alone, the unemployment rate is now \nabout as high as ours.  This is a big problem for advanced nations.  \nIt costs a lot of money to add an extra employee, with a lot of \npressure from low-wage producers in other countries that are growing \ntheir own economies and trying to provide new opportunity for their \npeople.  \n\t     \n\t     But it is especially important for America for two \nreasons:  One is, we have a whole lot of folks who, unless we move \naggressively, will not have the education and skills we need to be \ncompetitive and productive in a nation like this.  The second is, \neven if we educate them all, if there aren't jobs they will be robbed \nof the fruits of their educational labors.  People need to be able to \nwork in this country.  (Applause.)\n\t     \n\t     We have always had some unemployment; and, indeed, some \nof it is normal.  You've always got some people leaving jobs and \nmoving around the country and doing first one thing and another.  We \nhave now, at this moment in our history, the necessity for all big \norganizations, including the government, to reexamine the way they \nare organized and who ask whether there are too many people working \nat some kinds of jobs.  But in the whole, we must still be able to \ncreate jobs in a country like America, to provide people with the \nchance to work.  \n\t     \n\t     It's going to be difficult for me to make the welfare \nreform proposals that I will make to Congress in the next couple of \nmonths -- it's going to be hard for me to make those work if, at the \nend of all this work, to get off welfare there isn't a job.  \n(Applause.)\n\t     \n\t     So we have two tasks.  One is to develop the capacity of \nthe American people to perform without regard to race or income or \nthe circumstances of their birth.  The other is to make sure that \nthere are some opportunities for them to bring to bear for their \ntalent and to be rewarded with a paycheck.  It is a great challenge.  \nI do not pretend that all of the answers are simple.  But I know if \nyou want to ask the American people, all of them, to be more \nresponsible, if you want to recreate a sense of community in this \ncountry that bridges the lines of race and income and region, you \nhave got to have opportunity in that mix. \n\t     \n\t     A part of our vision for America has to be a future for \nevery young person in this country who's willing to play by the rules \nand work hard and strive for the end of the rainbow.  There has to be \nsomething at the end of that rainbow.  And that is what we are \nbasically here to talk about today:  What can we all do as partners, \nrecognizing none of us can do it alone, to develop the capacities of \nour people to succeed wherever they live and whatever their \nbackground.  And then, what can we do to make sure that there's \nsomething there for them to do?\n\n\t     The summer jobs program we're discussing today is an \nintegral part of that plan, because it will promote the values of \nwork and opportunity and fairness, community.  It will put the people \nfirst, and it does have a partnership between the public and private \nsector.\n\t     \n\t     I said when I addressed the United States Congress in \nFebruary on this program that I would seek to create about 700,000 \nextra summer jobs from government sources and then challenge the \nAmerican business community to meet that target so that we can create  \nmore than a million new summer jobs over and above what had been \ncreated before.\n\t     \n\t     Many, many people have responded to that challenge.  And \nJerry is just a shining example of that which has been replicated in \nthis room and around the country -- people who are going to do more \nthan they otherwise would in the private sector to give young people \na work experience.  And it is terribly important.\n\t     \n\t     I want to emphasize that this summer jobs program is \npart of an overall commitment to increase the capacity of the \nAmerican people -- from retraining defense workers who lose their \njobs and other adults who need to acquire new skills; to improving \nthe transition from school to work for young people who don't go to \ncollege but do need at least two years of post-high school training \neither on the job or in a community college or a vocational setting, \nso that they can be competitive workers, making it possible for more \npeople to go on to college who do want to go.\n\t     \n\t     All these things are part and parcel of a comprehensive \nplan.  It's also important, as I said, that we create more jobs.  The \nemergency jobs program that I asked the Congress to adopt would \ncreate a half a million extra jobs over the next year and a half, and \nthat would reduce the unemployment rate by a half a percent.  It \nwould also enable us to absorb more young people coming into the work \nforce in jobs that otherwise will not be created.\n\t     \n\t      It also will help a lot of cities and counties to \ninvest in things that need to be done at the grass-roots level --\nprojects long delayed, water projects, sewer projects, park projects, \nnew industries and particularly in small and medium-size communities \n-- a whole range of things that will improve the economy and improve \nthe environment.  \n\t     \n\t     The summer jobs program is an important part of that \nbecause we have tried for the first time, through the work of the \nLabor Department and the Education Department and through reaching \nout to people like you, to make this more than just a one-shot summer \njobs program; to integrate it with private sector efforts; to \nhopefully replicate it in each coming summer; to move these young \npeople into further educational opportunities and to further job \nopportunities; and to have a strong, meaningful education component \nto these summer jobs -- something that the United States government \nhas never fully emphasized before.  \n\t     \n\t     A lot of these young people, as you well know, because \nthey come from difficult backgrounds, because they go to school in \ndifficult and challenging circumstances, need extra help in building \ntheir basic skills in math and language, reasoning and in other \nareas.  And a lot of educational studies show that young people who \nhave difficulty in school often forget as much as 30 percent of what \nthey learn over the summer and then that has to be repeated the next \nyear.  \n\t     \n\t     What we are trying to do here is to give people the \nopportunity to learn good work habits and to reinforce their learning \nskills and to put them together; and then, hopefully, over the next \ncouple of years, if our entire program passes, to give every school \nin this country the opportunity to have a good work and learning \nenvironment.  \n\t     \n\t     There will be more applied academics, more opportunities \nfor people to learn and work during the school year, so that this \nwill not simply be an isolated moment for these young folks, but will \nbe a part of building a whole new educational experience, a whole new \nwork experience, and moving on a pathway to a better future.\n\t     \n\t     The summer jobs programs are not designed to be make-\nwork jobs.  They're designed to make a future for the people holding \nthe job.  And that's what they will do.  In the process, they'll help \nto build local communities, to strengthen local economies, to solve \nlocal problems.  Real jobs -- renovating housing, repairing public \nbuildings, doing clerical work, providing nursing assistance in \nhospitals, supervising and training children at child care centers, \nand learning all the way.  Challenging young people to learn while \nthey earn, but letting them earn.\n\t     \n\t     You know, it's very difficult to make a case to people \nwho have never seen opportunity on their own street that they should \ndo this, that, or the other thing if there's no evidence of the \nopportunity that's at the end of the effort.  I have not been sparing \nin going for the last year-and-a-half into places where it isn't \nexactly popular to say it, and say I wanted to reform the welfare \nsystem; I wanted to toughen child support; I wanted to require people \nto work; I was sick and tired of people being irresponsible in the \nuse of guns on the streets, and I wanted to change all that.  But if \nyou're going to summon people to greater responsibility, you have to \nreward them when they do the right thing with opportunity.  \n(Applause.)\n\t     \n\t     The young people we propose to put to work under our \nprogram will spend 90 hours learning basic skills, such as math, \nreading, writing -- either on the job in the classroom.  They will \nstretch their minds as well as work up a sweat.  They will have a \nsense of accomplishment.  It will literally be a summer challenge, \nbut a challenge that will take them into a different life.\n\t     \n\t     So I want to ask all of you to support this effort even \nas I, as your President, support your effort.  At the end of the \nsummer we will evaluate all the young people who participate.  We'll \nsee whether they, instead of falling behind over the summer \nacademically as too many young people do, they stayed even or moved \nahead.  I suspect that they will.  \n\t     \n\t     This summer, Secretary Reich and Secretary Riley and I \nwill be visiting many of your communities.  We'll really try to learn \nfrom you which of these efforts are working, what we should do next \nsummer, how we can build it in to what goes on during the school \nyear, how we can build in our job training efforts and the works that \nwe do with your companies to make sense of this whole thing -- so \nthat we maximize the impact of the taxpayer dollar and your private \ninvestments as well. \n\t     \n\t     We want to honor the companies and the communities, the \nbusiness leaders and the young people who do the very best jobs this \nsummer.  And, again, I want to say to all of you in private business \nwho have matched our effort, I thank you.  And to all of you who \nhaven't, and those across the country who may listen or learn about \nthis event today, I want to implore other private employers to \nstretch a little bit to give other young people a chance to work this \nsummer.  I'm telling you, we cannot go through another 10 years when \nwe don't give these children anything to say yes to.  If we exhort \nthem to do right, we've got to be able to reward them.  (Applause.)\n\t     \n\t     When the other speakers were talking, I was sitting up \nhere on the platform, listening and reveling.  And they got talking \nabout work, and I got to thinking about all the different things I've \ndone to make a living in my life.  When I was 13, I made a very \nfoolish short-term business investment:  I set up a comic book stand \nand sold two trunks full of comic books.  Made more money than I had \never had in my life.  But if I had saved those trunks, they'd be \nworth $100,000 today.  (Laughter.)\n\t     \n\t     That does not mean young people should not be \nentrepreneurial.  It just means that you can't foresee a generation \nahead.  I have mowed yards and cleared land and built houses and \nworked in body shops and the parts departments of a car dealership.  \nAnd I've done a lot of different things for a living.  Some \npeople say I got into politics to escape work.  (Laughter.)  \n\t     \n\t     I learned something from every job I ever had.  But I \ngrew up in a generation where I literally did not know a living soul \nwithout regard to race or income who wanted to work who didn't have a \njob.  I grew up in a generation when all you had to really say to \npeople is, get an education and you'll be all right.  You'll get a \njob and you'll make more money next year than you did this year.  Now \nI live in a generation full of people, most of whom don't make any \nmore money in real dollars than they did 10 years ago and they're \nworking longer hours and they're paying more for the basics of life.  \nAnd we are now wondering whether we can create the jobs that these \nyoung people want.\n\t     \n\t     Now, I want to close by reemphasizing these two things:  \nIt doesn't matter what kind of economic policies this administration \npursues, or how much productivity increases there are in the private \nsector, if young Americans don't get a good education, don't learn \nhow to work and can't be productive, those jobs will not be created \nin this country.  Machines will do the work or the work will be done \noff-shore by people who have the same skill levels and can work for a \nthird or a fourth or a fifth the wages.  So nothing we can do \neconomically will matter unless we build the skills and capacities of \nAmerica's work force.  And anybody that pretends otherwise is just \nkidding.  \n\t     \n\t     On the other hand, we need to be honest.  Every wealthy \ncountry in the world, including the United States, is having \ndifficulty creating jobs.  If I knew everything that needs to be done \nI'd be glad to tell you and we   could just call off the whole \ndeliberations of Congress and everything else.  I don't have all the \nanswers.  But I know this:  Doing nothing is not the answer.  \n(Applause.)\n\t     \n\t     And so the jobs program that I have presented to \nCongress, with the summer jobs, with the money for the cities and the \ncounties, through the Community Development Program, with the \ninfrastructure money, is a small part of a big budget.  It is an \nattempt to engage in an experiment to see whether or not, with the \neconomy recovering in terms of corporate profit, we can give a little \nboost to it, give opportunities to young people, create a half a \nmillion jobs and maybe get the engine going again.\n\t     \n\t     Most of the jobs in this program are going to be jobs in \nthe private sector, not government jobs, even though it's government \nmoney.  And the lion's share of the work in rebuilding the American \neconomy obviously will come from the private sector.  That's the kind \nof system we have and it works pretty well.  \n\t     \n\t     But this is the challenge we have.  So I ask all of you \nhere today to support the summer jobs program, to ask your friends \nand neighbors to support it, to go back home and ask your employers \nto make a little extra effort; to do what you can to help me pass the \nfunds to create the 700,000 jobs that the United States government \nshould create this summer, so that together we can have this \npartnership.  Because more than anything else, we have to give a \nfuture -- a future that our young people can believe in.  \n\t     \n\t     We need to send them a message that here in America if \nyou study hard and work hard, if you obey the law and contribute \nsomething to your community, you will be rewarded by your country.  \nYou can build a future from you own dreams. \n\t     \n\t     That has always been the promise of America.  Together \nthat's what this summer of challenge needs to be:  a reaffirmation of \nthe promise of America for so many young people to whom that promise \nhas been an illusion.  We can make it a reality.\n\t     \n\t     Thank you very much.  (Applause.)"},{"role":"assistant","content":"talk.politics.misc"}]}

Sophisticated\nencryption can have this effect in the United States.  When\nexported abroad, it can be used to thwart foreign intelligence\nactivities critical to our national interests.  In the past, it has\nbeen possible to preserve a government capability to conduct\nelectronic surveillance in furtherance of legitimate law\nenforcement and national security interests, while at the same time\nprotecting the privacy and civil liberties of all citizens.  As\nencryption technology improves, doing so will require new,\ninnovative approaches.\n\nIn the area of communications encryption, the U. S. Government has\ndeveloped a microcircuit that not only provides privacy through\nencryption that is substantially more robust than the current\ngovernment standard, but also permits escrowing of the keys needed\nto unlock the encryption.  The system for the escrowing of keys\nwill allow the government to gain access to encrypted information\nonly with appropriate legal authorization.\n\nTo assist law enforcement and other government agencies to collect\nand decrypt, under legal authority, electronically transmitted\ninformation, I hereby direct the following action to be taken:\n\nINSTALLATION OF GOVERNMENT-DEVELOPED MICROCIRCUITS\n\nThe Attorney General of the United States, or her representative,\nshall request manufacturers of communications hardware which\nincorporates encryption to install the U.S. government-developed\nkey-escrow microcircuits in their products.  The fact of law\nenforcement access to the escrowed keys will not be concealed from\nthe American public.  All appropriate steps shall be taken to\nensure that any existing or future versions of the key-escrow\nmicrocircuit are made widely available to U.S. communications\nhardware manufacturers, consistent with the need to ensure the\nsecurity of the key-escrow system.  In making this decision, I do\nnot intend to prevent the private sector from developing, or the\ngovernment from approving, other microcircuits or algorithms that\nare equally effective in assuring both privacy and a secure key-\nescrow system.\n\nKEY-ESCROW\n\nThe Attorney General shall make all arrangements with appropriate\nentities to hold the keys for the key-escrow microcircuits\ninstalled in communications equipment.  In each case, the key\nholder must agree to strict security procedures to prevent\nunauthorized release of the keys.  The keys shall be released only\nto government agencies that have established their authority to\nacquire the content of those communications that have been\nencrypted by devices containing the microcircuits.  The Attorney\nGeneral shall review for legal sufficiency the procedures by which\nan agency establishes its authority to acquire the content of such\ncommunications.\n\nPROCUREMENT AND USE OF ENCRYPTION DEVICES\n\nThe Secretary of Commerce, in consultation with other appropriate\nU.S. agencies, shall initiate a process to write standards to\nfacilitate the procurement and use of encryption devices fitted\nwith key-escrow microcircuits in federal communications systems\nthat process sensitive but unclassified information.  I expect this\nprocess to proceed on a schedule that will permit promulgation of\na final standard within six months of this directive. "},{"role":"assistant","content":"sci.crypt"}]}

Neil Smith\n\n                   LETTER TO A LIBERAL COLLEAGUE\n\n[AUTHOR'S NOTE:  \"Adrian\" -- name changed to protect the guilty -- \nand the author are science fiction novelists who once worked with \nthe same editor at a famous New York publishing house.]\n\nDear Adrian:  \n\nI'm way behind schedule on my current book again, so this reply to \nyour note -- criticizing the recent magazine interview I gave and \ngenerally attacking gun ownership -- will necessarily consist \nmostly of assertions you're free to believe (or not) I can back \nwith evidence and logic I've neither time nor energy to present \nnow.  I've written fully on this topic before and will again in the \nfuture.  When I do, I'll make sure you get copies.  \n\nThere are many arguments I might make, from the futility and danger \nof delegating self-defense to the police (see Don Kates in the Jan. \n10, 1985 WALL STREET JOURNAL) to the real effect of prohibition, \nshifting consumers from newly-outlawed handguns or semiautomatic \nrifles to items like sawed-off shotguns or homemade bombs, but I'll \nlimit myself here to commenting on the newspaper clipping you sent \nwith your note.  \n\nFirst, the freedom to own and carry the weapon of your choice is a \nnatural, fundamental, and inalienable human, individual, civil, and \nConstitutional right -- subject neither to the democratic process \nnor to arguments grounded in social utility.  \n\nSecond, publication of some latter-day \"scientific study\" doesn't \nalter the fact that the gun prohibitionists I discussed in my \ninterview -- annoying you so much in the process -- were lying.  \n\nThird, the freedom to own and carry the weapon of your choice is a \nnatural, fundamental, and inalienable human, individual, civil, and \nConstitutional right -- subject neither to the democratic process \nnor to arguments grounded in social utility.  \n\nFourth, as often happens with these things, the \"study\" doesn't \nsupport the gun prohibitionists' original numerical contentions \nanyway, but simply adds a new layer of spurious claims to an older \nbody of lies, omissions, and distortions.  \n\nFifth, the freedom to own and carry the weapon of your choice is a \nnatural, fundamental, and inalienable human, individual, civil, and \nConstitutional right -- subject neither to the democratic process \nnor to arguments grounded in social utility.  \n\nSixth, the fact that gun prohibitionists have been caught lying on \ncountless occasions (Carl Bakal, author of NO RIGHT TO KEEP AND \nBEAR ARMS, even confessed to it publicly) makes the value of this \npresent \"study\" dubious, to say the least.  \n\nSeventh, the freedom to own and carry the weapon of your choice is \na natural, fundamental, and inalienable human, individual, civil, \nand Constitutional right -- subject neither to the democratic \nprocess nor to arguments grounded in social utility.  \n\nEighth, given your own lifelong service as a federal bureaucrat \n(not to mention the cynical sophistication of your fiction), you \nshould be better aware than most people how \"progress\" -- in \ndesigning \"studies\" to prove whatever you want -- outstrips our \nability to collect meaningful data.  A case in point we might agree \non is the fact that it took another kind of prohibitionist 20 or 30 \nyears to create \"studies\" \"proving\" that pornography causes crime.  \nMore naive (and probably more honest) efforts in the 50s and 60s \nclearly indicate the contrary.  \n\nNinth, the freedom to own and carry the weapon of your choice is a \nnatural, fundamental, and inalienable human, individual, civil, and \nConstitutional right -- subject neither to the democratic process \nnor to arguments grounded in social utility.  \n\nTenth, another reason to doubt all such \"studies\" is that human \nbehavior (as the Austrian School of economics demonstrates) is far\ntoo complex and unpredictable to be meaningfully quantified.  The \nattempt to do so -- and then create public policy based on the \nresulting pseudo-information -- is wrecking our civilization.  \n\nEleventh, the freedom to own and carry the weapon of your choice is \na natural, fundamental, and inalienable human, individual, civil, \nand Constitutional right -- subject neither to the democratic \nprocess nor to arguments grounded in social utility.  \n\nTwelfth, the \"study\" is also worthless because it incorporates \nfigures for suicide, which is not necessarily a tragedy but \nbasically another individual right, sometimes with ancillary social \nbenefits.  If anything, perhaps suicide INTERVENTION should be a \ncriminal offense.  \n\nThirteenth and finally, the National Rifle Association officials \nquoted in the article, whatever their shortcomings (and they are \nmany), are correct in this instance:  the \"study\" is meaningless \nbecause the freedom to own and carry the weapon of your choice is a \nnatural, fundamental, and inalienable human, individual, civil, and \nConstitutional right -- subject neither to the democratic process \nnor to arguments grounded in social utility.  \n\nAnd because of that, Adrian, even if the \"study\" were valid, it \nwouldn't deter me from a lifelong personal objective of seeing that \nanyone can own any weapon he or she prefers and carry it however, \nwhenever, and wherever he or she desires without asking anybody's \npermission. In this I'm ably assisted by gun prohibitionists \nthemselves, whose yawping invariably moves previously unarmed \npeople to go out and buy their first gun \"while they still can\".  \nBefore the '68 Gun Control Act, most of the \"shooting fraternity\" \nviewed handguns (incorrectly, as it turned out) as inaccurate, \nineffective toys.  There probably weren't six million of them in \nthe whole country.  Now, thanks to Kennedy, Metzenbaum, the Bradys, \nand their ilk -- AMERICA'S GREATEST SPORTING GOODS SALES TEAM -- we \nprobably manufacture at least that many every year.\n\nThe fascinating datum is that Handgun Control, et al. are perfectly \naware of this -- so I guess you'll have to ask them yourself what \ntheir real motives are.  \n\nLook:  gun-making isn't an arcane or difficult art (and by the way, \nit's easier to make a fully automatic weapon than a semiautomatic; \nthe fact that I can still obtain my own weapon of preference, the \nself-loading pistol, is the only thing which keeps me from pursuing \nthis further).  Even if it were difficult, there are already a \nquarter billion firearms in America, with an estimated \"half life\" \nof 1000 years -- possibly more for stainless steel.  Guns are gonna \nbe around a long time, Adrian, whether you like it or not.\n\nAs for me, to paraphrase Elmer Keith, regardless of what the law \nprovides or any court decides, I'm always going to be armed.  And I \nwill always work to see that others are, as well.  The bad news is \nthat there are thousands more -- perhaps even hundreds of thousands \n-- where I come from.  We can't be stopped by passing laws, we can \nonly be forced to arm ourselves and others secretly and -- given \nboth the practical and alleged differences between full automatics \nand semiautomatics -- perhaps more efficiently.  \n\nSo what's the point?  \n\nL.

As he said himself:\n\n   The folkish-minded man, in particular, has the sacred duty, each in\n   his own denomination, of making _people_stop_just_talking_\n   superficially_of_God's_will,_and_actually_fulfill_God's_will,_and_\n   not_let_God's_word_be_desecrated._[orig. ital.]\n\n   For God's will gave men their form, their essence, and their\n   abilities.  Anyone who destroys His work is declaring war on the\n   Lord's creation, the divine will.  Therefore, let every man be\n   active, each in his own denomination if you please, and let every\n   man take it as his first and most sacred duty to oppose anyone who\n   in his activity by word or deed steps outside the confines of his\n   religious community and tries to butt into the other.\n\n   [...]\n\n   Hence today I believe that I am acting in accordance with the will\n   of the Almighty Creator: _by_defending_myself_against_the_Jew,_I_am_\n   fighting_for_the_work_of_the_Lord._[orig. ital.]\n\n          -- Adolf Hitler, from \"Mein Kampf\", trans. Ralph Mannheim.\n\nOf course, someone bad believing something does not make that belief\nwrong.  It's also entirely possible that Hitler was lying when he claimed \nto believe in God.  We certainly can't conclude that he's an atheist, \nthough.\n\n------------------------------\n\nSubject: The Bible proves it\n\nTypical posting:\n\nIn the Bible it says that...\n\nResponse:\n\nMost of the readers of alt.atheism feel that the Bible is of questionable\naccuracy, as it was written thousands of years ago by many authors who were\nrecording oral tradition that existed many years before.  Thus, any claimed\n'truth' in it is of questionable legitimacy.  This isn't to say that The\nBible has no truth in it; simply that any truth must be examined before being\naccepted.\n\nMany of the readers of this group also feel that because any passage is\nsubject to \"interpretation\", any claim that a passage 'means' one thing and\none thing only is not legitimate.\n\nNote that this feeling tends to extend to other books.\n\nIt is also remarkable to many atheists that theists tend to ignore other\nequally plausible religious books in favour of those of their own religion.\n\n------------------------------\n\nSubject: Pascal's Wager\n\nTypical posting:\n\nIf you believe in God and turn out to be incorrect, you have lost nothing --\nbut if you don't believe in God and turn out to be incorrect, you will go to\nhell. Therefore it is foolish to be an atheist.\n\nResponse:\n\nThis argument is known as Pascal's Wager.  It has several flaws.\n\nFirstly, it does not indicate which religion to follow.  Indeed, there are\nmany mutually exclusive and contradictory religions out there.  This is often\ndescribed as the \"avoiding the wrong hell\" problem.  If a person is a\nfollower of religion X, he may end up in religion Y's version of hell.\n\nSecondly, the statement that \"If you believe in God and turn out to be\nincorrect, you have lost nothing\" is not true.  Suppose you're believing in\nthe wrong God -- the true God might punish you for your foolishness.\nConsider also the deaths that have resulted from people rejecting medicine in\nfavour of prayer.\n\nAnother flaw in the argument is that it is based on the assumption that \nthe two possibilities are equally likely -- or at least, that they are of \ncomparable likelihood.  If, in fact, the possibility of there being a God \nis close to zero, the argument becomes much less persuasive.  So sadly the\nargument is only likely to convince those who believe already.\n\nAlso, many feel that for intellectually honest people, belief is based on \nevidence, with some amount of intuition.  It is not a matter of will or \ncost-benefit analysis.\n\nFormally speaking, the argument consists of four statements:\n\n  1. One does not know whether God exists.\n  2. Not believing in God is bad for one's eternal soul if God does\n     exist.\n  3. Believing in God is of no consequence if God does not exist.\n  4. Therefore it is in one's interest to believe in God.\n\nThere are two approaches to the argument.  The first is to view 1 as an\nassumption, and 2 as a consequence of it.  One problem with this approach, in\nthe abstract, is that it creates information from no information.  This is\nconsidered invalid in information theory.  Statement 1 indicates one has no\ninformation about God -- but statement 2 indicates that beneficial information\ncan be gained from the absolute lack of information about God.  This violates\ninformation entropy -- information has been extracted from no information, at\nno \"cost\".\n\nThe alternative approach is to claim that 1 and 2 are both assumptions.  The\nproblem with this is that 2 is then basically an assumption which states the\nChristian position, and only a Christian will agree with that assumption. The\nargument thus collapses to \"If you are a Christian, it is in your interests\nto believe in God\" -- a rather vacuous tautology, and not the way Pascal\nintended the argument to be viewed.\n\nThe biggest reason why Pascal's wager is a failure is that if God is\nomniscient he will certainly know who really believes and who believes as\na wager.  He will spurn the latter... assuming he actually cares at all\nwhether people believe in him.\n\n------------------------------\n\nSubject: What is Occam's Razor?\n\nTypical posting:\n\nPeople keep talking about Occam's Razor.  What is it?\n\nResponse:\n\nWilliam of Occam formulated a principle which has become known as Occam's \nRazor.  In its original form, it said \"Do not multiply entities \nunnecessarily.\"  That is, if you can explain something without supposing\nthe existence of some entity, then do so.\n\nNowadays when people refer to Occam's Razor, they generally express it \nmore generally, for example as \"Take the simplest solution\".\n\nThe relevance to atheism is that we can look at two possible explanations \nfor what we see around us:\n\n1. There is an incredibly intricate and complex universe out there, which\ncame into being as a result of natural processes.\n\n2. There is an incredibly intricate and complex universe out there, and \nthere is also a God who created the universe.  Clearly this God must be \nof non-zero complexity.\n\nGiven that both explanations fit the facts, Occam's Razor might suggest \nthat we should take the simpler of the two -- solution number one.\nUnfortunately, some argue that there is a third even more simple solution:\n\n3. There isn't an incredibly intricate and complex universe out there.  \nWe just imagine that there is.\n\nThis third option leads us logically towards solipsism, which many people \nfind unacceptable.\n \n------------------------------\n\nSubject: Why it's good to believe in Jesus\n\nTypical posting:\n\nI want to tell people about the virtues and benefits of my religion.\n\nResponse:\n\nPreaching is not appreciated.\n\nFeel free to talk about your religion, but please do not write postings that\nare on a \"conversion\" theme.  Such postings do not belong on alt.atheism and\nwill be rejected from alt.atheism.moderated (try the newsgroup\ntalk.religion.misc).\n\nYou would doubtless not welcome postings from atheists to your favourite\nnewsgroup in an attempt to convert you; please do unto others as you would\nhave them do unto you!\n\nOften theists make their basic claims about God in the form of lengthy\nanalogies or parables.  Be aware that atheists have heard of God and know the\nbasic claims about him; if the sole purpose of your parable is to tell\natheists that God exists and brings salvation, you may as well not post it,\nsince it tells us nothing we have not been told before.\n\n------------------------------\n\nSubject: Why I know that God exists\n\nTypical posting:\n\nI *know* from personal experience and prayer that God exists.\n\nResponse:\n\nJust as many theists have personal evidence that the being they worship\nexists, so many atheists have personal evidence that such beings do not\nexist.  That evidence varies from person to person.\n\nFurthermore, without wishing to dismiss your evidence out of hand, many\npeople have claimed all kinds of unlikely things -- that they have been\nabducted by UFOs, visited by the ghost of Elvis, and so on.\n\n------------------------------\n\nSubject: Einstein and \"God does not play dice\"\n\nTypical posting:\n\nAlbert Einstein believed in God.  Do you think you're cleverer than him?\n\nResponse:\n\nEinstein did once comment that \"God does not play dice [with the universe]\". \nThis quotation is commonly mentioned to show that Einstein believed in the\nChristian God.  Used this way, it is out of context; it refers to Einstein's\nrefusal to accept the uncertainties indicated by quantum theory. Furthermore,\nEinstein's religious background was Jewish rather than Christian.\n\nA better quotation showing what Einstein thought about God is the following:\n\"I believe in Spinoza's God who reveals himself in the orderly harmony of\nwhat exists, not in a God who concerns himself with fates and actions of\nhuman beings.\"\n\nEinstein was unable to accept Quantum Theory because of his belief in an\nobjective, orderly reality; a reality which would not be subject to random\nevents and which would not be dependent upon the observer.  He believed that\nQM was incomplete, and that a better theory would have no need for\nstatistical interpretations.  So far no such better theory has been found,\nand much evidence suggests that it never will be.\n\nA longer quote from Einstein appears in \"Science, Philosophy, and Religion, A\nSymposium\", published by the Conference on Science, Philosophy and Religion\nin Their Relation to the Democratic Way of Life, Inc., New York, 1941.  In\n\n  \"The more a man is imbued with the ordered regularity of all events\n   the firmer becomes his conviction that there is no room left by the side\n   of this ordered regularity for causes of a different nature.  For him\n   neither the rule of human nor the rule of divine will exists as an\n   independent cause of natural events.  To be sure, the doctrine of a\n   personal God interfering with natural events could never be\n   *refuted* [italics his], in the real sense, by science, for this\n   doctrine can always take refuge in those domains in which scientific\n   knowledge has not yet been able to set foot.\n\n   But I am convinced that such behavior on the part of representatives\n   of religion would not only be unworthy but also fatal.  For a doctrine\n   which is to maintain itself not in clear light but only in the dark,\n   will of necessity lose its effect on mankind, with incalculable harm\n   to human progress.  In their struggle for the ethical good, teachers\n   of religion must have the stature to give up the doctrine of a personal\n   God, that is, give up that source of fear and hope which in the past\n   placed such vast power in the hands of priests.  In their labors they\n   will have to avail themselves of those forces which are capable\n   of cultivating the Good, the True, and the Beautiful in humanity\n   itself.  This is, to be sure, a more difficult but an incomparably\n   more worthy task...\"\n\n\n  \"It was, of course, a lie what you read about my religous convictions,\n   a lie which is being systematically repeated.  I do not believe in a\n   personal God and I have never denied this but have expressed it clearly.\n   If something is in me which can be called religious then it is the\n   unbounded admiration for the structure of the world so far as our\n   science can reveal it.\"\n\nThe latter quote is from \"Albert Einstein: The Human Side\", edited by Helen \nDukas and Banesh Hoffman, and published by Princeton University Press.  \nAlso from the same book:\n\n  \"I do not believe in immortality of the individual, and I consider ethics\n   to be an exclusively human concern with no superhuman authority behind \n   it.\"\n\nOf course, the fact that Einstein chose not to believe in Christianity does \nnot in itself imply that Christianity is false.\n\n------------------------------\n\nSubject: Everyone worships something\n\nTypical posting:\n\nEveryone worships something, whether it's money, power or God.\n\nResponse:\n\nIf that is true, everyone is a polytheist.  Theists care just as much about\nthose things that atheists care about.  If the atheists' reactions to (for\nexample) their families amount to worship then so do the theists'.\n\n------------------------------\n\nSubject: Why there must be a causeless cause\n\nTypical posting:\n\nSets of integers that have a lower bound each have a smallest member, so\nchains of causes must all have a first element, a causeless cause.\n\nResponse:\n\nThe set of real numbers greater than zero has a definite lower bound, but has\nno smallest member.\n\nFurther, even if it is true that there must be a causeless cause, that does\nnot imply that that cause must be a conscious supernatural entity, and\nespecially not that any such entity must match the description favoured by\nany particular religion.\n\n------------------------------\n\nSubject: The universe is so complex it must have been designed\n\nTypical posting:\n\nThe presence of design in the universe proves there is a God.  Surely you\ndon't think all this appeared here just by chance?\n\nResponse:\n\nThis is known as the Argument From Design.\n\nIt is a matter of dispute whether there is any element of design in the\nuniverse. Those who believe that the complexity and diversity of living\ncreatures on the earth is evidence of a creator are best advised to read the\nnewsgroup talk.origins for a while.\n\nThere is insufficient space to summarize both sides of that debate here.\nHowever, the conclusion is that there is no scientific evidence in favour of\nso-called Scientific Creationism. Furthermore, there is much evidence,\nobservation and theory that can explain many of the complexities of the\nuniverse and life on earth.\n\nThe origin of the Argument by Design is a feeling that the existence of\nsomething as incredibly intricate as, say, a human is so improbable that\nsurely it can't have come about by chance; that surely there must be some \nexternal intelligence directing things so that humans come from the chaos\ndeliberately.\n\nBut if human intelligence is so improbable, surely the existence of a mind\ncapable of fashioning an entire universe complete with conscious beings must\nbe immeasurably more unlikely?  The approach used to argue in favour of the\nexistence of a creator can be turned around and applied to the Creationist\nposition.\n\nThis leads us to the familiar theme of \"If a creator created the universe,\nwhat created the creator?\", but with the addition of spiralling \nimprobability.  The only way out is to declare that the creator was not\ncreated and just \"is\" (or \"was\").\n\nFrom here we might as well ask what is wrong with saying that the universe\njust \"is\" without introducing a creator?  Indeed Stephen Hawking, in his book\n\"A Brief History of Time\", explains his theory that the universe is closed\nand finite in extent, with no beginning or end.\n\nThe Argument From Design is often stated by analogy, in the so-called \nWatchmaker Argument.  One is asked to imagine that one has found a watch on\nthe beach.  Does one assume that it was created by a watchmaker, or that it\nevolved naturally?  Of course one assumes a watchmaker.  Yet like the \nwatch, the universe is intricate and complex; so, the argument goes, the \nuniverse too must have a creator.\n\nThe Watchmaker analogy suffers from three particular flaws, over and above \nthose common to all Arguments By Design.  Firstly, a watchmaker creates \nwatches from pre-existing materials, whereas God is claimed to have \ncreated the universe from nothing.  These two sorts of creation are \nclearly fundamentally different, and the analogy is therefore rather weak.\n\nSecondly, a watchmaker makes watches, but there are many other things in \nthe world.  If we walked further along the beach and found a nuclear \nreactor, we wouldn't assume it was created by the watchmaker.  The argument \nwould therefore suggest a multitude of creators, each responsible for a \ndifferent part of creation.\n\nFinally, in the first part of the watchmaker argument we conclude that \nthe watch is not part of nature because it is ordered, and therefore \nstands out from the randomness of nature.  Yet in the second part of the \nargument, we start from the position that the universe is obviously not \nrandom, but shows elements of order.  The Watchmaker argument is thus \ninternally inconsistent.\n\n------------------------------\n\nSubject: Independent evidence that the Bible is true\n\nTypical posting:\n\nThe events of the New Testament are confirmed by independent documentary\nevidence.  For example...\n\nResponse:\n\nThe writings of Josephus are often mentioned as independent documentary\nevidence.\n\nEarly versions of Josephus's work are thought not to have mentioned Jesus or\nJames; the extant version discusses John in a non-Christian context.  Many\nscholars believe that the original mentioned Jesus and James in passing, but\nthat this was expanded by Christian copyists.  Several \"reconstructions\" of\nthe original text have been published to this effect.\n\nMuch information appears in the Ecclesiastical History of Eusebius (about 320\nC.E.).  It is worthless as historical material because of the deliberate\nfalsification of the wily Eusebius who is generally acknowledged as 'the\nfirst thoroughly dishonest historian of antiquity.' It is Eusebius who is\ngenerally given the title of authorship for this material.\n\nAside from the New Testament, the biographical information about Jesus is\nmore well-documented.  For further information, please consult the Frequently\nAsked Questions file for the newsgroup soc.religion.christian.\n\n------------------------------\n\nSubject: Godel's Incompleteness Theorem\n\nTypical posting:\n\nGodel's Incompleteness Theorem demonstrates that it is impossible for the\nBible to be both true and complete.\n\nResponse:\n\nGodel's First Incompleteness Theorem says that in any consistent formal \nsystem which is sufficiently expressive that it can model ordinary \narithmetic, one can formulate expressions which can never be proven to be \nvalid or invalid ('true' or 'false') within that formal system.  (Technically\nspeaking, the system must also be recursive; that is, there must be a decision\nprocedure for determining whether a given string is an axiom within the formal \nsystem.)\n\nEssentially, all such systems can formulate what is known as a \"Liar \nParadox.\"  The classic Liar Paradox sentence in ordinary English is \"This \nsentence is false.\"  Note that if a proposition is undecidable, the formal \nsystem cannot even deduce that it is undecidable.\n\nThe logic used in theological discussions is rarely well defined, so claims\nthat Godel's Incompleteness Theorem demonstrates that it is impossible to\nprove or disprove) the existence of God are worthless in isolation.\n\nOne can trivially define a formal system in which it is possible to prove the\nexistence of God, simply by having the existence of God stated as an axiom. \nThis is unlikely to be viewed by atheists as a convincing proof, however.\n\nIt may be possible to succeed in producing a formal system built on axioms\nthat both atheists and theists agree with.  It may then be possible to show\nthat Godel's Incompleteness Theorem holds for that system.  However, that\nwould still not demonstrate that it is impossible to prove that God exists\nwithin the system.  Furthermore, it certainly wouldn't tell us anything about\nwhether it is possible to prove the existence of God generally.\n\nNote also that all of these hypothetical formal systems tell us nothing about\nthe actual existence of God; the formal systems are just abstractions.\n\nAnother frequent claim is that Godel's Incompleteness Theorem demonstrates\nthat a religious text (the Bible, the Book of Mormon or whatever) cannot be\nboth consistent and universally applicable. Religious texts are not formal\nsystems, so such claims are nonsense.\n\n------------------------------\n\nSubject: George Bush on atheism and patriotism\n\nTypical posting:\n\nDid George Bush really say that atheists should not be considered citizens?\n\nResponse:\n\nThe following exchange took place at the Chicago airport between Robert I.\nSherman of American Atheist Press and George Bush, on August 27 1988. Sherman\nis a fully accredited reporter, and was present by invitation as a member of\nthe press corps.  The Republican presidential nominee was there to announce\nfederal disaster relief for Illinois.  The discussion turned to the\npresidential primary:\n\n RS: \"What will you do to win the votes of Americans who are atheists?\"\n\n GB: \"I guess I'm pretty weak in the atheist community.  Faith in\n      God is important to me.\"\n\n RS: \"Surely you recognize the equal citizenship and patriotism of\n      Americans who are atheists?\"\n\n GB: \"No, I don't know that atheists should be considered as citizens,\n      nor should they be considered patriots.  This is one nation under\n      God.\"\n\n RS: \"Do you support as a sound constitutional principle the separation\n      of state and church?\"\n\n GB: \"Yes, I support the separation of church and state.  I'm just not\n      very high on atheists.\"\n\nUPI reported on May 8, 1989, that various atheist organizations were\nstill angry over the remarks.\n\nThe exchange appeared in the Boulder Daily Camera on Monday February 27,\n1989.  It can also be found in \"Free Enquiry\" magazine, Fall 1988 issue,\nVolume 8, Number 4, page 16.\n\nOn October 29, 1988, Mr. Sherman had a confrontation with Ed Murnane,\ncochairman of the Bush-Quayle '88 Illinois campaign.  This concerned a\nlawsuit Mr. Sherman had filed to stop the Community Consolidated School\nDistrict 21 (Chicago, Illinois) from forcing his first-grade Atheist son to\npledge allegiance to the flag of the United States as \"one nation under God\"\n(Bush's phrase).  The following conversation took place:\n \n RS: \"American Atheists filed the Pledge of Allegiance lawsuit yesterday.\n      Does the Bush campaign have an official response to this filing?\"\n \n EM: \"It's bullshit.\"\n \n RS: \"What is bullshit?\"\n \n EM: \"Everything that American Atheists does, Rob, is bullshit.\"\n \n RS: \"Thank you for telling me what the official position of the Bush\n      campaign is on this issue.\"\n\n EM: \"You're welcome.\"\n\nAfter Bush's election, American Atheists wrote to Bush asking him to retract\nhis statement.  On February 21st 1989, C. Boyden Gray, Counsel to the\nPresident, replied on White House stationery that Bush substantively stood by\n\n  \"As you are aware, the President is a religious man who neither supports\n   atheism nor believes that atheism should be unnecessarily encouraged or\n   supported by the government.\"\n\nFor further information, contact American Atheist Veterans at the American\nAtheist Press's Cameron Road address.\n\n------------------------------\n\nSubject: I know where hell is!\n\nTypical posting:\n\nI know where Hell is!

See the accompanying posting on Atheist Resources for\ndetails.\n\nThere is a file containing some Biblical contradictions available from the\narchive-server@mantis.co.uk. See the contacts file for more information.\n\n------------------------------\n\nSubject: The USA is a Christian nation\n\nTypical posting:\n\nBecause of the religious beliefs of the founding fathers, shouldn't the\nUnited States be considered a Christian nation?\n\nResponse:\n\nBased upon the writings of several important founding fathers, it is clear\nthat they never intended the US to be a Christian nation.  Here are some\nquotes; there are many more.\n\n  \"What influence, in fact, have ecclesiastical establishments had on society?\n   In some instances they have been seen to erect a spiritual tyranny on the\n   ruins of the civil authority; on many instances they have been seen\n   upholding the thrones of political tyranny; in no instance have they been\n   the guardians of the liberties of the people.  Rulers who wish to subvert\n   the public liberty may have found an established clergy convenient\n   auxiliaries. A just government, instituted to secure and perpetuate it,\n   needs them not.\"\n      - James Madison, \"A Memorial and Remonstrance\", 1785\n\n  \"I almost shudder at the thought of alluding to the most fatal example of\n   the abuses of grief which the history of mankind has preserved--the Cross.\n   Consider what calamities that engine of grief has produced!\"\n      - John Adams, in a letter to Thomas Jefferson\n\n  \"History I believe furnishes no example of a priest-ridden people\n   maintaining a free civil government.  This marks the lowest grade of\n   ignorance, of which their political as well as religious leaders will\n   always avail themselves for their own purpose.\"\n\n      - Thomas Jefferson to Baron von Humboldt, 1813\n\n  \"I cannot conceive otherwise than that He, the Infinite Father, expects or\n   requires no worship or praise from us, but that He is even infinitely\n   above it.\"\n\n      - Benjamin Franklin, from \"Articles of Belief and Acts of Religion\",\n        Nov. 20, 1728\n\n------------------------------\n\nSubject: The USA is not a Christian nation\n\nTypical posting:\n\nIs it true that George Washington said that the United States is not in any\nsense founded upon the Christian religion?\n\nResponse:\n\nNo.  The quotation often given is in fact from Article XI of the 1797 Treaty\nof Tripoli (8 Stat 154, Treaty Series 358):\n\n   Article 11\n\n   As the government of the United States of America is not in any sense\n   founded on the Christian Religion, -- as it has in itself no character of\n   enmity against the laws, religion or tranquility of Musselmen, -- and as\n   the said States never have entered into any war or act of hostility\n   against any Mehomitan nation, it is declared by the parties that no\n   pretext arising from religious opinions shall ever produce an interruption\n   of the harmony existing between the two countries.\n\nThe text may be found in the Congressional Record or in treaty collections\nsuch as Charles Bevans' \"Treaties and Other International Agreements of the\nUnited States of America 1776-1949\", vol. 11 (pp. 1070-1080).\n\nThe English text of the Treaty of Tripoli was approved by the U.S. Senate on\nJune 7, 1797 and ratified by President John Adams on June 10, 1797.  It was\nrecently discovered that the Arabic version of the treaty not only lacks the\nquotation, it lacks Article XI altogether.\n\nThe person who translated the Arabic to English was Joel Barlow, Consul\nGeneral at Algiers, a close friend of Thomas Paine -- and an opponent of\nChristianity.  It is possible that Barlow made up Article XI, but since there\nis no Arabic version of that article to be found, it's hard to say.\n\nIn 1806 a new Treaty of Tripoli was ratified which no longer contained the\nquotation.\n"},{"role":"assistant","content":"alt.atheism"}]}

I use the English language\nand not the legal dialect. The legal definition of fraud changes from\none country to another in any case. The context of the discussion is morality\nof censorship.\n\n\n\n\nYou are extrapolating from the statement I made concerning a circumstance\nin which such an act of censorship would be permissable to the Teel case.\nIf you had bothered to read the post instead of trying to prove how stupid you\nthought me you would have done rather better. The mode of argument I was using\nwas a form of rhetoric. Argument by example, I describe a wide set of\ncircumstances in which an action is permisable and demonstrate that they\ndo not apply, thus the action is not permisable.\n\nObviously a company posting from a University adress would be squashed,  it\nwould be contrary to the internet comercial use.\n\n\nNow you are clutching at straws. In the context of the discussion it was\nthe fact of association between the company and the post that was important.\nThe typeface etc is inconsequential.\n\n\n\nIf you are implying that I am lying I suggest you read Mark Holohan and Ulick\nStaffords posts into soc.culture.british. If you are suggesting that \nadvocating murder is a trivial matter I would prefer that you state it\ndirectly. \n\nCertainly I oppose the right of Dr Sidiqui and the Ayatolah Khomenhi to\ncall for the murder of Salman Rushdie. Incitement to murder is not part\nof what I consider legitimate freedom of speech.\n\n\n\nThat is irrelevant, the case is not the incremental cost but the facility\ncost. If I decide that a company I am associated with should subscribe\nto USEnet that usenet connection is the property of the company. It is\nquite legitimate for a company to have a political or other agenda and\nregulate the use of its property in accordance with its policy. For example\nif a Microsoft employee were to post \"Windows NT is crap don't buy it\"\nfrom a Microsoft machine I would consider it reasonable for Microsoft to\nsack that employee. In the same way if a company decides that it has \npolitical objectives it might wish to regulate postings in a political\nmanner. This is no worse than Rupert Murdoch using his papers as a political\nplatform for his views.\n\n\n\nah yes you did not quote them, merely refered to them.\n\n\n\nYour article consisted of a reference to the first ammendment, your signature\nand pretty well damn all else. \n\n\n\nAre you refering to the initial hearings on an injunction or the judgments\non the substantive case?\n\nThe initial hearings that the government won were judged on the not unresonable\njudgment that assertion by the government that the national interest might be\nharmed would be grounds for prior restraint. The second set of hearings on the\nsubstance judged that the government had no case and that the official secrets\nact could not be used to suppress information in thwe public domain already.\nThe part that they won was over the copyright issue which is rather separate.\n\nHere again the issue of censorship is rather different in the case that\ninformation is divulged on the understanding that it will not be communicated\nto third parties. The first ammendment certainly does not apply in this\ncase as the numerous prosecutions of spies in the US proves. \n\nThe crux of the Spycatcher affair was extrateritoriality of British law.\nThe censorship aspect of it arose as a result of the government's\nludicrous attempts to prevent summary of the case in the book. \n\n\n\nFunny I saw that as a rejection of an assertion that you had made. Of course in\nrejecting an assertion I have to make a contrary assertion, since this assertion\nis unprovable I left it at that. \n\nSo far I have not seen you demonstrate a command of the contrary opinion to your\nown. You are attacking my anti-censorship view because I dare to accept the\nvalidity of some pro-censorship arguments while rejecting their conclusions. \nPlus I am not an absolutist. I have this funny idea that the solution to this\nproblem was not decided in 1789 by a group of white male gentry in secret\nsession and sumarized in a single line. Furthermore I don't think that the\nissues are half as simple as you imply.\n\n\nI don't think that you have geered your discourse to any audience save that\nof proving that you are the only person wearing a white hat.\n"},{"role":"assistant","content":"talk.politics.misc"}]}

It was not secret and well \nrecognized POW camp.  \n\nI see,  They vanished in Turkish labor camps.

Turkiye was never a clandestine state\nin its history,  It has been a respected and continuous member of UN \nsince the inception of UN.  No body ever questioned the UN membership of\nTurkey because of what had happened in 1974a and after.  Only a short \nlived arms embargo was imposed unilaterally by USA to satisfy the \ninternal Greek loby.  I know what you would say next.  Let me answer it\nbefore wasting anytime.  Yes!  UN had a few condemning resolutions \nagainst Turkey because of handling the Cyprus problem, especially after\nthe 1980 coup.  Well, US and Israel had a few too.  What can I say?\nI am sure during Athens Junta duruing 1960-74, Greeks had\ntheir own share too.\n\n\nHave you looked at the latest UN agenda for Cyprus talks\nmediated by Gali?  There was no issue whatsoever about any\nmissing people among the negotiating parties.  was there?\nI heard many times from Denktas interviews by Turkish and\nInternational press.  He keeps saying that \"This was no\nlonger an issue for peace talks.\"  Also, you don't want\nme fish for the Greek Cypriot politician's words (that Argic\nhad posted zillion times) describing missing peoples as \na Greek-Cypriot myth.  Seems that there is a different opinions \namong Greek-Cypriots as well about missing people in Turkish \ncustody.\n\n[..]\n\n\nI am not claiming anything.  I just told you what was\ngiven to Greek Cypriots as an answer by Turkish\nGoverment/Turkish Cypriots when they wanted to locate some\nof their own between July 15 and the final cease-fire in\nlate August, 1974.  This answer seems to satisfy the international \ncommunity, the UN, and the Vasilu Goverment (since he did not make it\nan issue for the peace talks).  Also, I am not aware of any UN\ncondemnation against Turkey about any missing Greek-Cypriot.  Are you?  \n\nBTW, do you mean that Nicos Sampson had a bloodless coup d'eta\nand nobody got hurt in those events?  \n\n\nLike I said before.  There is even a different opinion among\nGreek-Cypriots for this myth.   The officers in Turkish Army who\ngoverned the Adana POW camp must be hell of clever dudes\nto cover up their tracks 8-).

I am planning to send a letter to \nmy elected representatives telling them how utterly \nridiculous the Idaho lemon law is.  The law allows for \na \"use deduction\" equal to the IRS mileage allowance.  \nAs if Chevrolet were buying my gas and paying \nfor my insurance.\n\nSummary of the case:  In May 1992 I bought a new 3/4 ton\nHD Chevrolet pickup.  Between May 1992 and December 1992 \nthis vehicle required repair after repair.  Systems \nthat required attention included the transmission, \nheater fan, paint, suspension, and motor.  The main \nproblem was the five speed manual transmission.  They \ncould not install a non-defective transmission in at \nleast four attempts.\n\nSo, in summary, it is possible to get a repurchase, but \nyou are going to get screwed on the price, unless you \npaid too much in the first place, or if your car \nhappens to be a model that depreciates rapidly."},{"role":"assistant","content":"rec.autos"}]}

You conquered\nyour land (among others) a full millenia before we were thought of, and\nshortly thereafter weapons weren't quite so common.  I suspect that a few\nworld wars made a difference too, since in times of emergency weapons\ntend to be turned in or donated to needy causes.

I'm rather proud of my Norwegian and Danish heritage,\nwhereas I suspect you couldn't care less about that 2% Welsh blood in\nyour veins thanks to a raid in Ireland back in 1055?  The time scale\nand the homogeneous culture are important.  Equally important is a\nbasic philosophical difference in personal versus collective good.\nIn America, the individual is more important than the masses.  Personal\nliberties are prized above all.  This is, sadly, changing of late, but\nI trust you notice how this call for freedom makes laws that restrict\nindividuals for little collective benefit hateful to Americans.  I'd\nhazard a guess that, were America less interested in freedom and\npersonal liberty and more interested in collective good we never would\nhave sent our armed forces anywhere.  One poor effect of this culture\nwe have is that we're looking out for ourselves and it is quite easy\nto identify with only a small segment of the population.

Determining absolutes is, practically speaking, a\nwaste of time.  And we easily forget that relative truth is, in fact relative.\n\nFor example, I recently was asking some children the question \"What temperature\ndoes water boil at?\"  I got the answer 212 degrees consistently.  I asked\nif they knew what scale, and was told \"It's just 212 degrees.  Any scale.\nThat's what all thermometers say.\"  Well, that's sincere, and may be\ntrue in the experience of the speaker, but it is simply wrong.  IT is NOT\nan absolute truth.  Similarly, Scripture is full of Truth, which we should\nnurture and cherish, but trying to determine which parts are Absolute Truth\nand which parts are the manifestations of that in the context of the time\nand culture in which the text was penned is missing the point.  Then religion\neasily becomes an intellectual head-trip, devoid of the living experience of \nthe indwelling Trinity and becomes dead scholasticism, IMO.\n \n[example of head-covering in Church deleted]\n\nThis was a good example.  There may be an Absolute Truth behind the\nwriting, but the simplest understanding of the passage is that the\ninstructions apply to the Corinthians, and not necessarily elsewhere.\nThe instructions may reflect Absolute Truth in the context of first\ncentury culture and the particular climate at Corinth, which was having\na LOT of trouble with order. Is it Absolute Truth to me?  No.  And I \nsee no compelling, or even reasonable, reason that it should be.\n \n\nEven the most die-hard literalists do not take all of the Bible literally.\nI've yet to meet anyone who takes the verse \"blessed is he who takes your\nbabies and smashes their heads against the rocks\" literally.  The Bible\nwas not printed or handed to us by God with color codings to tell us\nwhat parts should be interpreted which way. \n \n\nI agree.  Very few.  And even if we knew them, personally, we may not be \nable to express that in a way that still conveys Absolute Truth to another.\nThe presence of absence of Absolutes may not make any difference, since I\nknow I can never fully apprehend an Absolute if it walks up and greets me.\n\nI can't prove the existence of absolutes.  I can only rely upon MY experience.\nI also trust God's revelation that WE cannot fully comprehend the infinite.\nTherefore we can't comprehend the Absolutes.  So I don't need them.  \nI can never know the essence of God, only the energies by and through which\nGod is manifested to God's creation.  So the reality can be that there ARE\nabsolutes, but it is of no practical importance.  It's like claiming that the\noriginal scriptural autographs were perfect, but copies may not be.  Swell.\nWho cares?  It doesn't affect me in any practical useful way.  I might as \nwell believe that God has made a lot of electric blue chickens, and that they\nlive on Mars.  Maybe God did.  So what? Is that going to have ANY effect on \nhow I deal with my neighbor, or God?  Whether or not I go to this or that\ncafeteria for lunch?  No.  \n\nThis attitude leads many non-Christians to believe that ALL Christians\nare arrogant idiots incapable of critical reasoning.  Christianity is true,\nwonderful and sensible.  It appeals to Reason, since Reason is an inner\nreflection of the Logos of God.  Explanations that violate that simply\nappear to be insecure authoritarian responses to a complex world.\n\nNOTE:  I'm NOT claiming there is no place for authority. That'd be silly.\n       There IS a world of difference between authoritative and authoritarian.\n       Authoritative is en expression of authority that respects others.\n       Authoritarian is en expression of authority that fails to do that,\n       and is generally agressive.  Good parents (like God) are authoritative.\n       Many Christians are simply authoritarian, and, not surprisingly, few \n       adults respond to this treatment.\n\nLarry Overacker (llo@shell.com)\n-- "},{"role":"assistant","content":"soc.religion.christian"}]}

Firstly, what do you exactly mean by \"fundamentalist\"?  I will\nfor the time being assume that what you mean is that your friend believes\nthat the bible is God's word to mankind?  I suspect that what happened\nto him is what he'll call being \"born again\"?  Anyway, was that recent?\nIf the answer is \"yes\" to all the questions above, it is quite\nunderstandable.  However, IMO, I'ld rather give advice to your friend!\nI think I've been through something similar to him, and one thing I can\nsay is that the basic problem is that each of you are now trying to\ncommunicate from different worldviews.  Why he talks about those things\nis because they are now \"obvious\" to him.  What is \"obvious\" to him is\nnot obvious to you.  Secondly, why he may be very persuasive is because\nfrom his point of view, he has been on \"both sides of the fence\".  This\nI mean that before he turned \"fundamentalist\", you two are agreeable\nbecause both of you see things from the same side.  If suddenly, as if\na new world of reality has suddenly opened up to him, it is like the\ndiscovery of let's say a new continent, or a new planet.  To him, he's\ngot to tell you because he has seen something much more wonderful than\nwhere he was, and what he thinks is much better than where you are now.\nYou have got to realise that from his point of view, he means well to\nyou, eventhough he may end up offending you.  To him, it is worth that\nrisk.  Nevertheless, it is really up to him to respect where you stand\nand listen to you as well.  At this moment, it may be difficult because\nhe is either very excited or feel it is too urgent to keep quiet about,\nhowever, he may not realise that he's really putting you off.\n\n[...]\n\n\nSo far, I've only been trying to explain things from his side.  However,\nI do understand how you feel too, because I wasn't a Christian for a good\npart of my life as well.  I was quite turned off by Christians or\n\"fundamentalists\" who were really all out and enthusiastic about their\nfaith.  They really scared me, to tell you the truth.  Unfortunately,\n\"religious belief\" is a very personal thing, just as your agnosticism\nis also a very personal thing to you.  Since the Christian belief is\ninevitably at odds with anything non-Christian (religious or otherwise),\nit will be a touchy matter.  Like all friendships, it will take both\nsides to do their part to make it work.  In this matter, maybe you can\ndo your part by telling him nicely that you are not able to dig what he's\ntrying to convince you about, that it's beyond you or not your concern\n\"for now\".  Don't tell him it's nonsense, because to him it is reality -\nand that would be a real insult.  He'll also have to be careful not to\ninsult where you stand too.\n\nLike I said before, I wish I could give your friend some advice too.\nI'll admit that I did similarly to some of my friends when I became a\nChristian.  In some ways, I wish I could have done things a little\ndifferently.  However, it was difficult then because I was so excited\nand just blabbered away about what I've found!  To me, it was too good\nnot to know.  To some, I was crazy, and I didn't really care most of\nthe time what they thought.  You will probably think he's crazy too -\nbut God is very real to him, as real as you are to him.  Keep that in\nmind.  And he thinks he can convince you because since God is so real\nto him, he doesn't see why God can't be real to you too.\n\nI don't know how helpful this is to you.  But all the best anyhow -\nthis is quite a challenge for you to face.  By the way, personal\nconviction: nobody is \"beyond saving\" except the one we call the \ndevil and his hosts."},{"role":"assistant","content":"soc.religion.christian"}]}

I know you are better informed than that.  The US \nhas never invaded Nicaragua (as far as I know).  We liberated Grenada \nfrom the Cubans\tto protect US citizens there and to prevent the completion \nof a strategic air strip.  Panama we invaded, true (twice this century).  \nVietnam?  We were invited in by the government of S. Vietnam.  (I guess \nwe \"invaded\" Saudi Arabia during the Gulf War, eh?)  Mexico?  We have \ninvaded Mexico 2 or 3 times, once this century, but there were no missiles \nfor anyone to shoot over here at that time.  Hawaii?  We liberated it from \nSpain.\n\nSo if you mean by the word \"invaded\" some sort of military action where\nwe cross someone's border, you are right 5 out of 6.

The first attempt failed in the summer\n\tof 1992 (the voting deadline was August 31, 1992).  The voting rules\n\tstate that another attempt for creating newsgroups can be started\n\tafter a six month waiting period (in this case, it is March 1, 1993).\n\tThis is the first attempt at creating comp.os.os2.multimedia and\n\tcomp.os.os2.bugs.\n\n\tThis document contains:\n\t*  the background showing the need for these proposals\n\t*  the proposed charters for these proposals\n\t*  voting instructions\n\t*  a voting ballot\n\t*  some example ballots\n\t*  the voting rules\n\t*  the voting schedule\n\t*  the Mass Acknowledgement\n\n\nBackground:\n\n\tThe creation of two, free, 32-bit compilers for OS/2 2.x (gcc/2\n\tand emx/gcc; read comp.os.os2.programmer for details) has spurred\n\ta continuing deluge of software ported from UNIX platforms, such\n\tas emacs, less, awk, grep, sed, xscheme, ispell, flex, yacc, and\n\tmuch more.  Borland has released its C/C++ compiler for OS/2 2.x,\n\tallowing for easier porting of DOS and Windows software.\n\n\tMuch of the PC hardware and drivers were written for DOS, and\n\tlater, Windows.  As more people are discovering OS/2 2.x, the\n\tnumber of people asking questions about OS/2's compatibility\n\twith their hardware increases, as does the questions on the\n\tavailability of drivers for their hardware, installation\n\tprocedures, etc.\n\n\tMultimedia is becoming popular.  OS/2 2.0 supports Windows\n\tMultimedia Extensions using Win-OS/2 3.0.  Furthermore, IBM is\n\tincluding direct multimedia support in OS/2 starting with version\n\t2.1 (in addition to using Win-OS/2 3.1).\n\n\tAny non-trivial software will have bugs -- OS/2 is not exempt,\n\tespecially since IBM is constantly adding new features to OS/2.\n\tSo far, IBM has issued system patches and corrective service disks\n\t(e.g.  the Service Pak) for free (free from BBSs and ftp sites, or\n\tfor free plus a small media charge for diskettes -- read\n\tcomp.os.os2.misc for details).\n\n\nProposed Charters:\n\n\t(a)  create comp.os.os2.programmer.porting (unmoderated)\n\n\t\tIt will provide a forum for developers of ported software so\n\t\tas to coordinate efforts, avoid duplication of effort, and\n\t\tspur additional development.  The group will also cover\n\t\ttopics such as porting from other platforms (such as DOS,\n\t\tWindows, UNIX, etc), toolkits which aid in program\n\t\tportability (including porting tools such as Mirrors), and\n\t\tso forth.\n\n\t(b)  rename: comp.os.os2.programmer.misc (unmoderated)\n\n\t\tTo keep the structure of the OS/2 newsgroup heirarchy\n\t\torthogonal, comp.os.os2.programmer should be renamed to\n\t\tcomp.os.os2.programmer.misc.\n\n\t\tcomp.os.os2.programmer.misc will still be the newsgroup\n\t\tfor OS/2 programmers to discuss programming issues and\n\t\ttechnical aspects of OS/2 in an unmoderated setting.\n\n\t(c)  create comp.os.os2.setup (unmoderated)\n\n\t\tIt will be devoted to OS/2 system setup topics, including the\n\t\tavailability of device drivers, compatibility information,\n\t\tinstallation procedures, system requirements, and overall\n\t\tperformance optimization.\n\n\t(d)  create comp.os.os2.multimedia (unmoderated)\n\n\t\tIt will provide a forum for discussion of multi-media issues.\n\n\t(e)  create comp.os.os2.bugs (unmoderated)\n\n\t\tIt will provide a forum for OS/2 system bug reports, bug\n\t\tdiagnosis and work arounds, the availability of system\n\t\tpatches and corrective service disks, and so forth.\n\n\t\t[Note that discussion of bugs in applications belong in other\n\t\tnewsgroups, and discussion of bugs in OS/2 betas belong in\n\t\tcomp.os.os2.beta]\n\n\nHow to Vote:\n\n\tTo cast your vote, fill out the ballot below and e-mail it to me.\n\tMany newsreaders will allow e-mail to be sent by replying to this\n\tpost.

I will\n\t  post the ACK twice (see Schedule below).\n\n\t* If you need help for using your editor, using e-mail, how\n\t  voting works in general, etc. then ask an expert at your site.\n\t  Also see the ``How To Create a New Newsgroup'' article which is\n\t  posted to news.answers on a regular basis.\n\n\t* If you need any clarifications on voting procedures for this\n\t  CFV, send me e-mail at mlevis@ringer.cs.utsa.edu.\n\n\t* When the voting period is over (see Schedule below), a proposal\n\t  passes if both of the following formulas are true:\n\t  1)  the number of YES votes exceeds the number of NO votes\n\t      by at least 100 (i.e. YES >= NO + 100, or YES - NO >= 100).\n\t  2)  the number of YES votes exceeds at least twice the\n\t      number of NO votes (i.e. YES >= 2 * NO, or YES - NO >= NO).\n\t  In other words, a proposal passes if:\n\t      YES - NO >= max (100, NO)\n\t  where max() returns the highest number given to it.\n\n\nSchedule:\n\n\tThe voting period started on March 29 when the first CFV was posted\n\tby David Lawrence (the news.announce.newgroups moderator).\n\n\tThis third CFV is a repeat of the first CFV, but it also has the\n\tMass Acknowledgement (ACK) of names and e-mail addresses of those who\n\thave already voted -- re-send your vote if it is not there.  If you\n\thave not voted yet, vote now!\n\n\tThe voting period will end at 11:59:59 pm (Central Time), on\n\tApril 24, 1993.  Votes received after that time will not count.\n\tThe voting results and tally will be posted shortly after that\n\tdate.\n\n\nMass Acknowledgement:\n\n\tHere is the list of people who have already sent in their ballots\n\tas of 12:01 am (Central Time) on April 15, 1993:\n\n                          bdubbs@cs.tamu.edu\nAiyagari, Sanjay          ska1@crux3.cit.cornell.edu\nAlcorn, Justin
