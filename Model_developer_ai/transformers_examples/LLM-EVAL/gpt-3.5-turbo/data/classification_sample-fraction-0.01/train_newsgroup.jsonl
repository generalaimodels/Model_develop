So...the easiest way to get away with attacking\nanother is to use an innocent as a shield and hope that the other respects\ninnocent lives?\n\n\nYour damn right Israel insists on some sort of \"demilitarized\" or \"buffer\"\nzone. Its had to put up with too many years of attacks from the territory\nof Arab states and watched as the states did nothing. It is not exactly\nsurprizing that Israel decided that the only way to stop such actions is to \ndo it themselves.\n\n\nWhat? So the whole bit about attacks on Israel from neighboring Arab states \ncan start all over again? While I also hope for this to happen, it will\nonly occur WHEN Arab states show that they are *prepared* to take on the \nresponsibility and the duty to stop guerilla attacks on Israel from their \nsoil. They have to Prove it (or provide some \"guaratees\"), there is no way\nIsrael is going to accept their \"word\"- not with their past attitude of \ntolerance towards \"anti-Israel guerillas in-residence\".\n\nGood lord, Brad.

It can ask them to leave *at any time*; as Nasser did in '56 and\n'67. Somehow, with that \"limitation\" on the troops \"powers\" I don't\nthink that Israel is going to be any more comfortable. Without a *genuine* commitment to peace from the Arab states, and concrete (not intellectual or political exercises in jargon) \"guarantees\" by other parties, the UN is worthless\nto Israel (but, perhaps useful as a \"ruse\"?).\n\n\nPerhaps you are aware that, to most communities of people, there is\nthe feeling that it is better that \"many of us die fighting\nagainst those who attack us than for few to die while we silently \naccept our fate.\" If,however, you call on Israel to see the sense of \nsuffering fewer casualties, I suggest you apply the same to Palestinian,\nArab and Islamic groups.\n\n\nFrom Israel's perspective, \"concessions\" gets it NOTHING...except the \nrealization that it has given \"something\" up and now *can only \nhope* that the other side decides to do likewise. Words *can be taken\nback* by merely doing so; to \"take back\" tangible items (land,\ncontrol of land) requires the sort of action you say Israel should\nstay away from.\n \nIsrael put up with attacks from Arab state territories for decades \nbefore essentially putting a stop to it through its invasion of Lebanon.\nThe entire basis of that reality was exactly as you state above: 1) Israel \nwould express outrage at these attacks and protest to the Arab state \ninvolved, 2) that state promptly ignored the entire matter, secure \nin the knowledge that IT could not be held responsible for the acts \ncommitted by \"private groups\", 3) Israel would prepare for the next \nround of attacks. What would Israel want to return to those days (and\ndon't be so idiotic as to suggest \"trust\" for the motivations of\npresent-day Arab states)?\n\nAh, ok...what is \"different\" about the present situation that tells\nus that the Arab states will *not* pursue their past antagonistic \npolicies towards Israel? Now, don't talk about vague \"political factors\"\nbut about those \"tangible\" (just like that which Israel gave up)\nfactors that \"guarantee\" the responsibility of those states. Your\nassessment of \"difference\" here is based on a whole lot of assumptions,\nand most states don't feel confortable basing their existence on that\nsort of thing.\n\n\nIt has not.

And with that, I just don't see how you can label Roussel as\nthe most disappointing player on the Flyers this season.\n\nYou say Soderstrom played against better competition.  That may very well\nbe, but there is no way of knowing how Roussel would have performed in\nthose games.  Besides, against the better scoring teams like Pittsburgh,\nthe defense is more keyed up than they are against San Jose.\n\n\nBut I'm not just judging Roussel on that game alone.  I've seen him play\nfor the past two seasons in Philly and before that in Hershey.  It's just\nmy opinion, but I think he's got what it takes.  Of course, I thought that\nabout Mark LaForest, too.  But I never did about Wendell Young.  So I'm\nbatting .500 in judging Hershey talent since the Hextall-era.\n\nAs for the Rangers game, you can say he was saved by a mistake by the\noffensive player if you like.  But Rou had his leg in position to make the\nsave.  If he didn't, it wouldn't have mattered if the Rangers player didn't\nget the puck up or not.  It would have been a goal.  On a breakaway that's\nwhat the goalie wants to do, take away as much as possible and force the\nshooter to beat him.\n\n\nI seem to remember Roussel doing an excellent job against Pittsurgh on\nopening night to give the Flyers a tie against the two-time defending\nchamps.  And not to take anything away from Soderstrom because he was\nsenational in that game agains the Habs.  But you can't tell me that a\nMontreal player had an open net to shoot at some point during that game\nand just flat out missed it.  Mistakes, both on offense and defense are\npart of the game.

Michael\nSiemon acknowledges this every time he writes that the resolution\nof an argument over them turns on secular and cultural\nassumptions that are independent of these rules.\n \n\nThe commandment to love your neighbor as yourself can be viewed,\nin part, as reminding man that he is not God and cannot act as if\nhe has \"ultimate responsibility.\" Indeed, many traditions present\nan interpretation where believers are supposed to interpret\nloving one's neighbor as following various other rules, and\nrelying on their god to make things come out right, precisely\nbecause it would be wrong for man to assume such \"ultimate\nresponsibility.\" Once again, we are confronted with good sounding\ngoo that means whatever the reader wants it to mean. \n\n\nAnd who is to say that this interpretation is \"twisted\"?  There\nare many passages in the Bible that in their most straightforward\nreading show the Christian god behaving in just this way.\nMichael cannot refer to \"base\" claims or base commandments to\nshow that such readings are \"twisted,\" because this divergence in\nunderstanding occurs even in trying to interpret the \"base\"\nclaims and commandments.  In addressing conservative Christians,\nMichael will necessarily draw upon secular and cultural notions\nthat these conservative Christians will reject.  \n\n\nBut these base commandments are too vague to serve as  \"a\nprinciple for the CRITIQUE of ethical systems.\" The meaning of\nthese base commandments for any believer derives from the secular\nand cultural notions that the believer brings to them, from how\nthe believer mixes their demands with straightforward readings of\nother Biblical passages, from a particular sectarian tradition,\nor from some combination of these things.  These commandments\nlack sufficient substance in themself to serve as a basis for\ncriticizing ethical systems.  What meaning they have comes from\nthe ethical system the believer brings to these commandments. \n\n\nJesus explicitly states that this summarizes Jewish law, which\nwould seem to bring in all of it if we properly understand what\nit means to love God and love our neighbors.  There are *many*\nparables and teachings the gospels attribute to Jesus that are\nstraightforwardly read as ethical commandments.  The Pauline\nepistles are similarly full.  If it is not clear that these all\ncome together in a sensible understanding of ethical behavior,\nthe problem is *not* a lack of raw material. \n\n-*----\n\nNo, Michael, the conservative Christians also take the gospel \nseriously.  What differentiates you is the way you interpret the\ngospel.\n\n\nIn a sense, the wide variety of interpretations does tell us\nsomething about Christianity.  It tells us that the New Testament\nauthors left a sufficiently vague hodge-podge that it can serve\nas the source text for many, vastly different beliefs about the\nnature of the Christian god and about what men should and\nshouldn't do. \n\nThe irony here is that there is *nothing* in Christianity per\nse that Michael can use to support the cause of lesbians and\ngays.  *Every* Christian principle he turns to this cause is\neffective only through the extra-Christian principles through\nwhich Michael interprets his religion, and the homophobes apply\nthe *same* Christian principles, with equal justification, to\ntheir cause.  In short, it is the extra-Christian principles that\nmake Michael's Christianity beneficial, and I suspect they would\nbe as beneficial, perhaps moreso, without being filtered by\nChristian interpretation.  \n\nMichael paints a picture of \"standard American atheism\" as the\nrejection of the evil in many conservative Christian\ninterpretations of the Bible.  But I think it is even more\ndamaging to Christianity to note that the New Testament presents\nsuch a vague hodge-podge of notions about the nature of God and\nthe nature of the good (except, of course, when it is ordered by\nan interpretation that relies on extraneous principles).  Here, I\nthink we should apply a Christian parable, where a cold drink can\nhave its value and a hot drink can have its value, but the\nlukewarm we should spit out.

DH allows both ends to agree on\na session key which they use with symmetric cryptography (something\nlike DES) for the encryption.\n\nHow could the \"back door\" keys work in this system?  I can see a few\npossibilities.  One is that the DH-like algorithm has the property that\nthe session key can be deduced by an eavesdropper who knows the back door\nkeys for one (or possibly both) communicants.  Perhaps the random numbers\nused in the DH are seeded by the back door key, or some such.\n\nAnother possibility, as was suggested here earlier, is that the chips\nsimply broadcast the session key, encrypted with the chip's own\ninternal secret key.  In this system the back door keys are secret keys\nusable for decrypting this session key broadcast.  Actually the chip's\nsecret key doesn't need to be a public key in this usage, but can be\nidentical to the secret back-door key.  (This proposal seems most\nstraightforward to me.)\n\nStill another possibility is that the encryption algorithm used for the\nmessage itself has a \"dual key\" property, that possession of either of\ntwo keys can be used to decrypt it.  One key would be the session key from\nthe DH exchange, and the other would be the back door key for the chip.\n\nIt's worth noting that one of the proposals Dorothy Denning raised\nduring her amazingly prescient on-line discussion last November and\nDecember was a variation on Diffie-Hellman in which a third party would\nparticipate in deriving the session keys.  This doesn't quite fit into\nwhat we know of how Clipper works but it hints that those who had early\nknowledge of Clipper (or whose thinking was somehow synchronized with\nClipper designers) may have had Diffie-Hellman on their minds."},{"role":"assistant","content":"sci.crypt"}]}

And\njudging from encouraging messages offered by the representatives of these\npolitical groups and organizations, at least here in Greece, the Armenian\nCause enjoys abundant support from a wide spectrum of the political world.\n\nThe International Meeting of Solidarity was sponsored by the Greek branch of\nthe Armenian Popular Movement, a comparatively new political force headed\nby younger generations of Armenians, who openly profess their support of the\narmed struggle and of the Armenian Secret Army for the Liberation of Armenia\n(ASALA). The organization has branches in various European and Middle Eastern\ncountries and the United States although some of these branches appear to\nhave gone through a switch of loyalties because of the split within the ranks\nof ASALA...\n\nVoicing the support of PASOK, the ruling party in Greece, to the Armenian\npeople, was Mr. Charalambidi Michalis, a member of the Central Committee of\nthe party and the Greek member of the Permanent People's Tribunal...\nExplaining the goals and aspirations of the Armenian Popular Movement \nwas Ara Sarkisian. Significant was the address delivered by Mr. Bassam \nAbu-Salim, on behalf of the Popular Front for the movement's continued \nsupport of the Armenians' armed struggle in their pursuit of their cause, \npledging that Palestinian operated and run training camps would always be \nopen to Armenian youth who need training for such a struggle.

Also on hand to follow\nthe deliberations was the ambassador of Bulgaria in Athens.\n\nMore than significant was the large number of messages received by the \norganizers, including the following: Palestinian National Revolutionary\nMovement, Fatah; Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General\nCommand; the Central Committee of the Palestinian National Liberation\nMovement-Fatah; the Socialist Progressive Party of Lebanon; Arab Socialist\nLabor Party; the Kurdistan Democratic Union of Iraq; and numerous other\ninternational groups, all noted for their radical stand in the Israeli-\nPalestinian conflict.\n\n                 SUPPORT FROM ARF-RM\n\nAmong messages received from Armenian groups was the Armenian Revolutionary\nFederation-Revolutionary Movement, the group that has claimed the abduction\nand assassination of key party leaders in Lebanon accused of selling out to\nforeign interests and powers. The message clearly gave its support to the\nArmenian Popular Movement pledging that the Revolutionary movement will\ncontinue to \"reveal the realities, no matter how bitter or tragic they are,\"\nto expose the anti-Armenian activities of the leaders of the Dashnag \"Bureau.\"\nThe message was taken as an indication of the link, loose as it may be, that\nexists between the dissident Dashnag group and the Armenian Popular Movement,\nopen supporters of ASALA and armed struggle.\n\nThe Armenian Popular Movement has set up its headquarters in a suburb of the\nGreek capital, known as Neos Kosmos, where there is a large Armenian presence.\nThe headquarters are located in a two-story building, which appears to have\nturned into a beehive of activity on the part of scores of Armenian youth, who\nprefer to give their first names only when invited to introduce themselves...\n\nNow any comment?\n\n#From: vd8@cunixb.cc.columbia.edu (Vedat  Dogan)\n#Subject: Re:Addressing.....\n#Message-ID: <1993Apr8.233029.29094@news.columbia.edu>\n\n \n \nn>crap posted by Mr. [(*]!\n \n o boy!   \n \n Please, can you tell us why those quotes are \"crap\"?..because you do not \n like them!!!...because they really exist...why?\n \n As I said in my previous posting, those quotes exactly exist in the source \n given by Serdar Argic .. \n  \n You couldn't reject it...\n \n \n Here we go again..\n In the book I have, both the front page and the Author's preface give \n the same year: 1923 and 15 January, 1923, respectively!\n (Anyone can check it at her/his library,if not, I can send you the copies of\n pages, please ask by sct) \n \n \nI really don't care what year it was first published(1923 or 1924)\nWhat I care about is what the book writes about murders, tortures,et..in\nthe given quotes by Serdar Argic, and your denial of these quotes..and your\ngroundless accussations, etc. \n \n[...]\n \n \n I claim I have a book in my hand published in 1923(first publication)\n and it exactly has the same quoted info as the book published\n in 1934(Serdar Argic's Reference) has..You couldn't reject it..but, now you\n are avoiding the real issues by twisting around..\n \n Let's see how you lie!..(from 'non-existing' quotes to re-publication)\n \n First you said there was no such a quote in the given reference..You\n called Serdar Argic a liar!..\n I said to you, NO, MR.Davidian, there exactly existed such a quote...\n (I even gave the call number, page numbers..you could't reject it.)\n \n And now, you are lying again and talking about \"modified,re-published book\"\n(without any proof :how, when, where, by whom, etc..)..\n (by the way, how is it possible to re-publish the book in 1923 if it was\n  first published in 1924(your claim).I am sure that you have some 'pretty \n  well suited theories', as usual)\n \n And I am ready to send the copies of the necessary pages to anybody who\n wants to compare the fact and Mr.Davidian's lies...I also give the call number\n and page numbers again for the library use, which are:  \n                 949.6 R 198\n   \n  and the page numbers to verify the quotes:218 and 215\n              \n     \n \n \n Now, are you claiming that there can't be such a reference by saying \"it is\n not possible...\" ..If not, what is your point?\n \n Differences in the number of pages?\n Mine was published in 1923..Serdar Argic's was in 1934..\n No need to use the same book size and the same letter \n charachter in both publications,etc, etc.. does it give you an idea!!\n \n The issue was not the number of pages the book has..or the year\n first published.. \n And you tried to hide the whole point..\n the point is that both books have the exactly the same quotes about\n how moslems are killed, tortured,etc by Armenians..and those quotes given \n by Serdar Argic exist!! \n It was the issue, wasn't-it?  \n \n you were not able to object it...Does it bother you anyway? \n \n You name all these tortures and murders (by Armenians) as a \"crap\"..\n People who think like you are among the main reasons why the World still\n has so many \"craps\" in the 1993. \n \n Any question?\n \nSerdar Argic"},{"role":"assistant","content":"talk.politics.mideast"}]}

This\nAndi Beyer character shows no signs of anti semitism, yet\nbecause he deviates from the norm of accepted opinion, you\nattack him.  Why did not anyone venture to answer Andi's\nquestion in an intelligent and unoffending manner?  The only\nones guilty here of not backing up there viewpoints with fact\nare the Israelophiles.  Now will we please start having some\nINTELLIGENT conversation?  You all are an insult to you race!\n{assuming you are also semitic}\n\tNow I have a comment concerning Israeli terrorism\nduring the 1930's and 1940's.  The Hirgun, and other branch -\noff militant groups, did fight the British do get them out of\nPalestine.  Yet I fail to see how this Israeli form of\nterrorism was better than the terrorism practiced now by the\nArabs.  These Jewish terrorist groups killed innocent British\nsoldiers, but not only thta also killed many Jews who were in\nfavor of a compromise with the Palestinians.  In addition, they\nmassacred an entire Palestinian village in 1948, contributing\nto the exodus of the frightened Palestinians who feared their\nvery lives.\n\tI mention this not because I'm anti semitic [I'm part\nJewish] but because this self righteousness on the part of the\nIsraelites pisses me off so.  I'm not as critical of the\nPalestinians because they were indeed screwed over by the\nJews.  It 's a damn shame that the Palestinians had to pay for\nGerman and European anti semitism."},{"role":"assistant","content":"talk.politics.mideast"}]}

I glow everytime Ronnie's out on the ice.\nIn fact, one of the neatest things about seeing the Pens in person\nis that I can key in on him instead of watching what I'd probably\nbe seeing on tv.  He does so many subtle things behind the play.\n\nHe said in an interview recently that when he was a kid his dad\nstressed the importance of playing two-way hockey; that you have to\nlearn how to play defense as well as offense and he obviously took\nthat advice to heart.  He was a breath of fresh air when he arrived\nin Pittsburgh to the team whose forwards, for the most part, couldn't\nand wouldn't play a lick of defense.\n\nIt's really difficult to assess what the key trades were that brought\nall of this success to the Pens.  You mention Rick Tocchet and he has\ncertainly helped, and even ol' Kjell has been steady.  But looking at\nthis team you could almost take any one of them out of the line-up\npermanently and replace them with an extremely mediocre player and it\nwouldn't matter.\n\nIf I had to pick the top three acquisitions in recent years they would\nbe 1) Tom Barrasso; 2) Ron Francis; 3) Larry Murphy.  (I'd love to put\nFrancis first but I do think the only thing that could really damage\nthe Pens right now would be to lose Barrasso.)"},{"role":"assistant","content":"rec.sport.hockey"}]}
