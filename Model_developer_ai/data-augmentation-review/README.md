# Introduction
Data augmentation can be simply described as any method that makes our dataset larger by making modified copies of the existing dataset. To create more images for example, we could zoom in and save the result, we could change the brightness of the image or rotate it. To get a bigger sound dataset we could try to raise or lower the pitch of the audio sample or slow down/speed up.
Example data augmentation techniques are presented in the diagram below.

#### - [Random erasing](https://github.com/zhunzhong07/Random-Erasing) ![](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/zhunzhong07/Random-Erasing.svg?style=social) - The code is based on the paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.04896. The Abstract:

In this paper, we introduce Random Erasing, a new data augmentation method for training the convolutional neural network (CNN). In training, Random Erasing randomly selects a rectangle region in an image and erases its pixels with random values. In this process, training images with various levels of occlusion are generated, which reduces the risk of over-fitting and makes the model robust to occlusion. Random Erasing is parameter learning free, easy to implement, and can be integrated with most of the CNN-based recognition models. Albeit simple, Random Erasing is complementary to commonly used data augmentation techniques such as random cropping and flipping, and yields consistent improvement over strong baselines in image classification, object detection and person re-identification. Code is available at: this https URL.

#### - [Data Augmentation optimized for GAN (DAG)](https://github.com/sutd-visual-computing-group/dag-gans) ![](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/sutd-visual-computing-group/dag-gans.svg?style=social) - implementation in PyTorch and Tensorflow
DAG-GAN provides simple implementations of the DAG modules in both PyTorch and TensorFlow, which can be easily integrated into any GAN models to improve the performance, especially in the case of limited data. We only illustrate some augmentation techniques (rotation, cropping, flipping, ...) as discussed in our paper, but our DAG is not limited to these augmentations. The more augmentation to be used, the better improvements DAG enhances the GAN models. It is also easy to design your augmentations within the modules. However, there may be a trade-off between the numbers of many augmentations to be used in DAG and the computational cost.

#### - [Unsupervised Data Augmentation (google-research/uda)](https://github.com/google-research/uda) ![](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/google-research/uda.svg?style=social) - implementation in Tensorflow.
Unsupervised Data Augmentation or UDA is a semi-supervised learning method which achieves state-of-the-art results on a wide variety of language and vision tasks. With only 20 labeled examples, UDA outperforms the previous state-of-the-art on IMDb trained on 25,000 labeled examples.

They are releasing the following:
* Code for text classifications based on BERT.
* Code for image classifications on CIFAR-10 and SVHN.
* Code and checkpoints for our back translation augmentation system.


#### - [AugLy](https://github.com/facebookresearch/AugLy) ![](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/facebookresearch/AugLy.svg?style=social)  - AugLy is a data augmentations library that currently supports four modalities (audio, image, text & video) and over 100 augmentations. 

Each modality’s augmentations are contained within its own sub-library. These sub-libraries include both function-based and class-based transforms, composition operators, and have the option to provide metadata about the transform applied, including its intensity.

AugLy is a great library to utilize for augmenting your data in model training, or to evaluate the robustness gaps of your model! We designed AugLy to include many specific data augmentations that users perform in real life on internet platforms like Facebook's -- for example making an image into a meme, overlaying text/emojis on images/videos, reposting a screenshot from social media. While AugLy contains more generic data augmentations as well, it will be particularly useful to you if you're working on a problem like copy detection, hate speech detection, or copyright infringement where these "internet user" types of data augmentations are prevalent.

AugLy is a great library to utilize for augmenting your data in model training, or to evaluate the robustness gaps of your model! We designed AugLy to include many specific data augmentations that users perform in real life on internet platforms like Facebook's -- for example making an image into a meme, overlaying text/emojis on images/videos, reposting a screenshot from social media. While AugLy contains more generic data augmentations as well, it will be particularly useful to you if you're working on a problem like copy detection, hate speech detection, or copyright infringement where these "internet user" types of data augmentations are prevalent.

#### - [TextAttack 🐙](https://github.com/QData/TextAttack)  ![](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/QData/TextAttack.svg?style=social) - TextAttack is a Python framework for adversarial attacks, data augmentation, and model training in NLP.
Many of the components of TextAttack are useful for data augmentation. The `textattack.Augmenter` class
uses a transformation and a list of constraints to augment data. We also offer five built-in recipes
for data augmentation [source:QData/TextAttack](https://github.com/QData/TextAttack):
- `textattack.WordNetAugmenter` augments text by replacing words with WordNet synonyms
- `textattack.EmbeddingAugmenter` augments text by replacing words with neighbors in the counter-fitted embedding space, with a constraint to ensure their cosine similarity is at least 0.8
- `textattack.CharSwapAugmenter` augments text by substituting, deleting, inserting, and swapping adjacent characters
- `textattack.EasyDataAugmenter` augments text with a combination of word insertions, substitutions and deletions.
- `textattack.CheckListAugmenter` augments text by contraction/extension and by substituting names, locations, numbers.
- `textattack.CLAREAugmenter` augments text by replacing, inserting, and merging with a pre-trained masked language model.

#### - [EDA NLP](https://github.com/jasonwei20/eda_nlp)  ![](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/jasonwei20/eda_nlp.svg?style=social) - **EDA** is an **e**asy **d**ata **a**ugmentation techniques for boosting performance on text classification tasks. These are a generalized set of data augmentation techniques that are easy to implement and have shown improvements on five NLP classification tasks, with substantial improvements on datasets of size `N < 500`. While other techniques require you to train a language model on an external dataset just to get a small boost, we found that simple text editing operations using EDA result in good performance gains. Given a sentence in the training set, we perform the following operations:

- **Synonym Replacement (SR):** Randomly choose *n* words from the sentence that are not stop words. Replace each of these words with one of its synonyms chosen at random.
- **Random Insertion (RI):** Find a random synonym of a random word in the sentence that is not a stop word. Insert that synonym into a random position in the sentence. Do this *n* times.
- **Random Swap (RS):** Randomly choose two words in the sentence and swap their positions. Do this *n* times.
- **Random Deletion (RD):** For each word in the sentence, randomly remove it with probability *p*.

## Challenges
* [AutoDL 2019 (NeurIPS AutoDL challenges - includes AutoAugment)](https://autodl.chalearn.org/) - Machine Learning and in particular Deep Learning has achieved considerable successes in recent years and an ever-growing number of disciplines rely on it. However, this success crucially relies on human intervention in many steps (data pre-processing, feature engineering, model selection, hyper-parameter optimization, etc.). As the complexity of these tasks is often beyond non-experts, the rapid growth of machine learning applications has created a demand for off-the-shelf or reusable methods, which can be used easily and without expert knowledge. **The objective of AutoML (Automated Machine Learning) challenges is to provide "universal learning machines" (deep learning or others), which can learn and make predictions without human intervention (blind testing).** 

## Workshops
* [Interactive Labeling and Data Augmentation for Vision
ICCV 2021 Workshop](https://ildav-workshop.github.io/program/) - The workshop on Interactive Labeling and Data Augmentation for Vision (ILDAV) wishes to address novel ways to solve computer vision problems where large quantities of labeled image data may not be readily available. It is important that datasets of sufficient size can be quickly and cheaply acquired and labeled. More specifically, we are interested in solutions to this problem that make use of (i) few-click and interactive data annotation, where machine learning is used to enhance human annotation skill, (ii) synthetic data generation, where one uses artificially generated data to augment real datasets, and (iii) weak supervision, where auxiliary or weak signals are used instead of (or to complement) manual labels.

More broadly, we aim at fostering a collaboration between academia and industry in terms of leveraging machine learning research and human-in-the-loop, interactive labeling to quickly build datasets that will enable the use of powerful deep models in all problems of computer vision.

The workshop topics include (but are not limited to):

* Interactive and Few-click annotation
* Data augmentation
* Synthetic data for training models
* Weak supervision
* Human-in-the-loop learning
