    "### Basic Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Definition of a Graph\n",
    "\n",
    "A graph is a mathematical structure consisting of a set of vertices (also called nodes or points) and a set of edges (also called links or arcs) that connect pairs of vertices. Formally, we can define a graph G as an ordered pair (V, E), where V represents the set of vertices and E represents the set of edges. Graphs are widely used to model pairwise relationships between objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Types of Graphs\n",
    "\n",
    "Graphs can be classified into various types based on certain characteristics:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Directed Graphs (Digraphs):** In a directed graph, each edge has a direction associated with it. This means that the edge (u, v) from vertex u to vertex v does not imply the existence of the edge (v, u). Directed graphs are used to represent asymmetric relationships.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Undirected Graphs:** In an undirected graph, edges do not have a direction. If there is an edge between vertices u and v, it implies the existence of an edge between vertices v and u. Undirected graphs are used to represent symmetric relationships.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Weighted Graphs:** In a weighted graph, each edge has a weight or a cost associated with it. These weights can represent various quantities such as distance, time, or cost. Weighted graphs are used to model scenarios where the relationship between vertices has some numerical value.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Connected Graphs:** A connected graph is a graph in which there is a path between every pair of vertices. In other words, there are no isolated vertices in a connected graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Disconnected Graphs:** A disconnected graph is a graph in which there are two or more connected components, where each connected component is a subgraph in which there is a path between every pair of vertices.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Graph Terminology\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some common terms used in graph theory:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Vertex (Node):** A fundamental unit of a graph.\n",
    "- **Edge (Link):** A connection between two vertices.\n",
    "- **Degree of a Vertex:** The number of edges incident to a vertex.\n",
    "- **Path:** A sequence of vertices connected by edges.\n",
    "- **Cycle:** A path in which the first and last vertices are the same.\n",
    "- **Connectivity:** The property of a graph that describes how vertices are connected to each other.\n",
    "- **Adjacency:** Two vertices are adjacent if they are connected by an edge.\n",
    "- **Neighborhood:** The set of vertices adjacent to a given vertex.\n",

    "\n",
    "Graphs can be represented using different data structures, each with its own advantages and disadvantages. Three common methods for representing graphs are:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Adjacency Matrix\n",
    "\n",
    "An adjacency matrix is a 2D array of size V x V, where V is the number of vertices in the graph. Each cell (i, j) in the matrix represents whether there is an edge from vertex i to vertex j. The value stored in the cell can be a boolean (for unweighted graphs) or a numerical value (for weighted graphs) indicating the weight of the edge.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Steps for Representing a Graph using Adjacency Matrix:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Initialization:** Create a V x V matrix initialized with zeros (for unweighted graphs) or infinity (for weighted graphs).\n",
    "2. **Edge Insertion:** For each edge (u, v) in the graph, set the corresponding cell (u, v) in the matrix to 1 (for unweighted graphs) or to the weight of the edge (for weighted graphs).\n",
    "3. **Edge Removal:** To remove an edge (u, v), simply set the cell (u, v) to 0 or infinity.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Advantages:\n",
    "- Efficient for dense graphs with many edges.\n",
    "- Checking for the existence of an edge between two vertices takes constant time.\n",

    "##### Disadvantages:\n",
    "- Consumes more space, especially for sparse graphs.\n",
    "- Adding or removing vertices can be inefficient as it requires resizing the matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Adjacency List\n",
    "\n",
    "An adjacency list is a collection of lists or arrays, where each list/array represents a vertex in the graph. Each list/array stores the vertices that are adjacent to the corresponding vertex.\n",

    "3. **Edge Removal:** To remove an edge (u, v), simply remove vertex v from the list/array corresponding to vertex u.\n",

    "- Efficient for sparse graphs with fewer edges.\n",
    "- Requires less space compared to adjacency matrix for sparse graphs.\n",
    "- Adding or removing vertices is efficient.\n",
