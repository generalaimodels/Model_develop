Here are 5 different scenarios for using the provided logging configuration:

1. Debugging an application:
```python
import logging

# Configure logging
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO, format='%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s')

def calculate_sum(a, b):
    logging.info(f"Calculating the sum of {a} and {b}")
    result = a + b
    logging.info(f"The sum is: {result}")
    return result

# Example usage
result = calculate_sum(5, 3)
```
In this scenario, the logging configuration is used to log informative messages during the execution of the `calculate_sum` function. This can be helpful for debugging purposes, as it allows you to track the flow of the program and inspect the values of variables at different points.

2. Monitoring a long-running process:
```python
import logging
import time

# Configure logging
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO, format='%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s')

def process_data():
    logging.info("Starting data processing")
    # Simulating a long-running process
    time.sleep(5)
    logging.info("Data processing completed")

# Example usage
process_data()
```
In this scenario, the logging configuration is used to monitor a long-running process. By logging informative messages at the start and end of the process, you can keep track of its progress and duration. This is especially useful when dealing with time-consuming tasks or background processes.

3. Error handling and exception logging:
```python
import logging

# Configure logging
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO, format='%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s')

def divide_numbers(a, b):
    try:
        result = a / b
        logging.info(f"The division result is: {result}")
        return result
    except ZeroDivisionError as e:
        logging.error(f"Error occurred: {str(e)}")
        raise

# Example usage
try:
    divide_numbers(10, 0)
except ZeroDivisionError:
    logging.info("Caught ZeroDivisionError")
```
In this scenario, the logging configuration is used for error handling and exception logging. When an exception occurs (e.g., division by zero), an error message is logged using `logging.error()`. This helps in identifying and diagnosing issues in the code. Additionally, informative messages can be logged for successful operations.

4. Logging in a web application:
```python
import logging
from flask import Flask

app = Flask(__name__)

# Configure logging
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO, format='%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s')

@app.route('/')
def home():
    logging.info("Received request for home page")
    return "Welcome to the home page"

# Example usage
if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run()
```
In this scenario, the logging configuration is used in a web application built with Flask. By logging informative messages for each incoming request, you can monitor the traffic and usage of your web application. This can be helpful for troubleshooting issues, analyzing user behavior, and optimizing performance.

5. Logging to a file:
```python
import logging

# Configure logging to write to a file
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO, format='%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s', filename='app.log')

def perform_operation():
    logging.info("Starting the operation")
    # Perform some operation
    logging.info("Operation completed")

# Example usage
perform_operation()
```
In this scenario, the logging configuration is modified to write log messages to a file named `app.log`. By specifying the `filename` parameter in `logging.basicConfig()`, all log messages will be saved to the specified file instead of being printed to the console. This is useful when you want to persist log messages for later analysis or when running the application in a production environment.

These are just a few examples of how you can use the provided logging configuration in different scenarios. The logging module in Python is flexible and can be adapted to various use cases depending on your specific requirements.



Sure! Here are three more advanced snippets that demonstrate different use cases for logging:

1. Logging with different severity levels:
```python
import logging

# Configure logging
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG, format='%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s')

# Example usage
logging.debug("This is a debug message")
logging.info("This is an informative message")
logging.warning("This is a warning message")
logging.error("This is an error message")
logging.critical("This is a critical message")
```
In this snippet, the logging configuration is set to the `DEBUG` level, which means that all log messages with severity levels of `DEBUG` and above will be logged. The snippet demonstrates logging messages with different severity levels using the corresponding logging functions (`debug()`, `info()`, `warning()`, `error()`, and `critical()`). This allows you to differentiate between different types of messages and control the verbosity of your logs based on the severity level.

2. Logging with custom logger and handlers:
```python
import logging

# Create a custom logger
logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

# Create handlers
console_handler = logging.StreamHandler()
file_handler = logging.FileHandler('app.log')

# Set the level and format for each handler
console_handler.setLevel(logging.INFO)
file_handler.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)

console_format = logging.Formatter('%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s')
file_format = logging.Formatter('%(asctime)s - %(name)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s')

console_handler.setFormatter(console_format)
file_handler.setFormatter(file_format)

# Add the handlers to the logger
logger.addHandler(console_handler)
logger.addHandler(file_handler)

# Example usage
logger.debug("This is a debug message")
logger.info("This is an informative message")
logger.warning("This is a warning message")
logger.error("This is an error message")
logger.critical("This is a critical message")
```
In this snippet, a custom logger is created using `logging.getLogger(__name__)`. Two handlers are configured: a `StreamHandler` for logging to the console and a `FileHandler` for logging to a file named `app.log`. Each handler is set with a different logging level and format. The console handler is set to log messages with severity level `INFO` and above, while the file handler is set to log messages with severity level `DEBUG` and above. The handlers are then added to the logger using `logger.addHandler()`. This allows for more granular control over the logging behavior and enables logging to multiple destinations simultaneously.

3. Logging with configuration from a file:
```python
import logging
import logging.config

# Load logging configuration from a file
logging.config.fileConfig('logging.conf')

# Get the logger
logger = logging.getLogger('myapp')

# Example usage
logger.debug("This is a debug message")
logger.info("This is an informative message")
logger.warning("This is a warning message")
logger.error("This is an error message")
logger.critical("This is a critical message")
```
In this snippet, the logging configuration is loaded from a file named `logging.conf` using `logging.config.fileConfig()`. The configuration file specifies the loggers, handlers, formatters, and their respective settings. By separating the logging configuration from the code, it becomes easier to manage and modify the logging behavior without modifying the source code. The logger is then obtained using `logging.getLogger('myapp')`, where `'myapp'` is the name of the logger defined in the configuration file. The logging messages are logged using the corresponding logging functions.

These snippets demonstrate more advanced usage of the logging module, including logging with different severity levels, using custom loggers and handlers, and loading logging configuration from a file. These techniques provide greater flexibility and control over the logging behavior in your Python applications.

Certainly! Here's an example that demonstrates a best practice for using the logging module in a Python script:

```python
import logging
import os

# Create a logger
logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
logger.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)

# Create a file handler
log_directory = 'logs'
os.makedirs(log_directory, exist_ok=True)
log_file = os.path.join(log_directory, 'application.log')
file_handler = logging.FileHandler(log_file)
file_handler.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)

# Create a console handler
console_handler = logging.StreamHandler()
console_handler.setLevel(logging.INFO)

# Create formatters and add them to the handlers
file_formatter = logging.Formatter('%(asctime)s - %(name)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s')
console_formatter = logging.Formatter('%(levelname)s - %(message)s')
file_handler.setFormatter(file_formatter)
console_handler.setFormatter(console_formatter)

# Add the handlers to the logger
logger.addHandler(file_handler)
logger.addHandler(console_handler)

def process_data(data):
    logger.debug(f"Processing data: {data}")
    # Perform data processing logic here
    processed_data = data.upper()
    logger.debug(f"Processed data: {processed_data}")
    return processed_data

def main():
    logger.info("Application started")
    
    try:
        # Example usage
        data = "Hello, World!"
        logger.info(f"Input data: {data}")
        result = process_data(data)
        logger.info(f"Result: {result}")
    except Exception as e:
        logger.exception("An error occurred")
    
    logger.info("Application finished")

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

In this example, we follow several best practices for using the logging module:

1. We create a logger using `logging.getLogger(__name__)` to get a logger with the name of the current module. This allows us to easily identify the source of the log messages.

2. We set the log level of the logger to `DEBUG` using `logger.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)`. This ensures that all log messages with severity levels of `DEBUG` and above will be logged.

3. We create two handlers: a `FileHandler` for logging to a file and a `StreamHandler` for logging to the console. The file handler is set to log messages with severity level `DEBUG` and above, while the console handler is set to log messages with severity level `INFO` and above. This allows us to have different levels of verbosity for file and console logging.

4. We create separate formatters for the file and console handlers. The file formatter includes more detailed information such as timestamp, logger name, and log level, while the console formatter provides a simpler format with just the log level and message.

5. We add the handlers to the logger using `logger.addHandler()`. This ensures that the log messages are sent to both the file and console handlers.

6. We use the logger throughout the script to log messages at different severity levels. For example, `logger.debug()` is used for detailed debugging information, `logger.info()` for general information, and `logger.exception()` for logging exceptions.

7. We wrap the main logic of the script inside a `try-except` block to catch and log any exceptions that may occur using `logger.exception()`.

8. We log informative messages at the start and end of the application using `logger.info()` to indicate the application's lifecycle.

By following these best practices, we ensure that our logging is well-organized, informative, and easy to maintain. The log messages are captured in both a log file and the console, allowing for better debugging and monitoring of the application's behavior.
