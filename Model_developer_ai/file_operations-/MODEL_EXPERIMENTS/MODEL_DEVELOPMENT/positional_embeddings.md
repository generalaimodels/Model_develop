| Positional Encoding         | It is a method used to represent the position of words or tokens in a sequence, often employed in neural networks. |
| Transformer Positional Encoding | A specific type of positional encoding used in transformer architectures, which injects positional information directly into the input embeddings. |
| Sinusoidal Positional Encoding | A common form of positional encoding that utilizes sinusoidal functions to encode positional information.          |
| Absolute Positional Encoding | An approach where absolute positions are directly encoded into the input embeddings, often used in convolutional models. |
| Relative Positional Encoding | This method encodes relative positions between tokens, capturing their positional relationships within a sequence. |
| Fixed Positional Encoding | Positional encoding that assigns fixed values to each position, which remain constant throughout the training process. |
| Learned Positional Encoding | In this technique, the model learns to generate positional embeddings during training, allowing for adaptability to different sequences. |
| Discrete Positional Encoding | Positional encoding where positions are represented discretely, often used in scenarios where precise positional information is required. |
| Continuous Positional Encoding | Encoding method that represents positions as continuous values, suitable for tasks where fine-grained positional information is needed. |
| 1D Positional Encoding | A type of positional encoding designed for one-dimensional sequences, such as text or time-series data. |
| Multi-dimensional Positional Encoding | Encoding approach that extends positional embeddings to multiple dimensions, accommodating complex positional relationships. |
| Spatial Positional Encoding | Encoding technique tailored for spatial data, such as images or 3D point clouds, capturing spatial relationships between elements. |
| Temporal Positional Encoding | Specifically designed for temporal data, this encoding method encodes time-related information into the input embeddings. |
| Dynamic Positional Encoding | Positional encoding that dynamically adjusts based on the context or sequence length, offering flexibility in handling variable-length inputs. |
| Hierarchical Positional Encoding | Encoding strategy that hierarchically encodes positions at different levels of granularity, useful for hierarchical data structures. |
| Graph Positional Encoding | Encoding method suitable for graph-structured data, capturing positional relationships between nodes and edges in a graph. |
| Implicit Positional Encoding | Positional encoding that implicitly captures positional information through the model architecture or training process. |
| Attention-based Positional Encoding | Encoding technique that incorporates attention mechanisms to attend to positional information, enhancing the model's ability to process sequential data. |
| Non-attention-based Positional Encoding | Positional encoding method that does not rely on attention mechanisms, often used in architectures where attention is not employed. |
| Linear Positional Encoding | Encoding approach that linearly maps positions to embeddings, providing a straightforward representation of positional information. |
| Radial Positional Encoding | Encoding method that encodes positions based on their radial distance from a reference point, commonly used in spatial data analysis. |
| Kernelized Positional Encoding | Positional encoding technique that employs kernel functions to encode positional relationships, offering enhanced modeling capabilities. |
| Weighted Positional Encoding | Encoding method where positional embeddings are weighted based on their importance or relevance to the task, allowing for adaptive representation. |
| Fourier Positional Encoding | Encoding approach that utilizes Fourier series to represent positional information, particularly effective for capturing periodic patterns. |
| Displacement Positional Encoding | Positional encoding that represents positions as displacements from a reference point or origin, suitable for relative positioning tasks. |
