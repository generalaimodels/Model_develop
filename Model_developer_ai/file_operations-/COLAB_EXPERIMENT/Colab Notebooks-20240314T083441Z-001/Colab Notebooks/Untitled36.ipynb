In BFS, we use a queue to keep track of nodes that we need to explore.\n","\n","2. **Initialize the queue with the starting node**: The starting node is the first node that we begin our search from. We add this node to our queue as the first point of exploration.\n","\n","3. **Create a visited set**: This is a data structure (usually a hash set) that keeps track of all the nodes that we have visited. This helps us avoid revisiting the same node and getting stuck in a loop.\n","\n","4. **While the queue is not empty**: This is the main loop of our algorithm. As long as there are nodes in our queue (i.e., nodes that we need to explore), we keep the search going.\n","\n","5. **Dequeue a node from the front of the queue**: We remove a node from the front of the queue and explore it. This is in line with the FIFO principle of the queue.\n","\n","6. **Check if the node is the goal node**: If the node we have just dequeued is the goal node we are searching for, we terminate the search. We have found the shortest path to our goal node.\n","\n","7. **Otherwise, add the node to the visited set**: If the node is not the goal node, we add it to our visited set. This marks the node as explored.\n","\n","8. **Enqueue all the neighboring nodes of the current node that have not been visited**: Finally, we add all the neighboring nodes of the current node to our queue, provided they have not been visited yet. This sets up these nodes to be the next points of exploration in subsequent iterations of our loop.\n","\n","This process continues until we either find the goal node or exhaust all possible paths, i.e., our queue becomes empty. The BFS algorithm is particularly useful for finding the shortest path in unweighted graphs..\n","\n","\n","(1) en.wikipedia.org. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breadth-first_search."],"metadata":{"id":"0Si3u476-aaH"}},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":2,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"e3JFRaEq-X_J","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1706108961186,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":467,"user":{"displayName":"hemanth varma","userId":"05483789954770220327"}},"outputId":"1ae5855c-f43f-40ec-abb0-ecbb5f53cdb5"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Found the goal node: F\n","True\n"]}],"source":["from collections import deque\n","\n","# Define a simple graph using an adjacency list\n","# Each key represents a node, and the values are lists of neighbors\n","graph = {\n","    'A': ['B', 'C'],\n","    'B': ['D', 'E'],\n","    'C': ['F'],\n","    'D': [],\n","    'E': ['F'],\n","    'F': []\n","}\n","\n","# The BFS function\n","def bfs(graph, start_node, goal_node):\n","    # Step 1: Create a queue and initialize it with the starting node\n","    queue = deque([start_node])\n","\n","    # Step 3: Create a visited set to keep track of visited nodes\n","    visited = set()\n","\n","    # Step 4: While the queue is not empty\n","    while queue:\n","        # Step 5: Dequeue a node from the front of the queue\n","        current_node = queue.popleft()\n","\n","        # Step 6: Check if the node is the goal node\n","        if current_node == goal_node:\n","            print(f\"Found the goal node: {current_node}\")\n","            return True\n","\n","        # Step 7: Otherwise, add the node to the visited set\n","        visited.add(current_node)\n","\n","        # Step 8: Enqueue all the neighboring nodes that have not been visited\n","        for neighbor in graph[current_node]:\n","            if neighbor not in visited:\n","                queue.append(neighbor)\n","\n","    # If we have gone through the entire graph and haven't found the goal node\n","    print(\"Goal node not found in the graph.\")\n","    return False\n","\n","# Example usage\n","start = 'A'\n","goal = 'F'\n","print(bfs(graph, start, goal))"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Sure, here's the Python code for Depth-First Search (DFS) and the mathematical explanation:\n","\n","**Python Code:**\n","```python\n","def dfs(graph, start):\n","    visited = set()\n","    stack = [start]\n","\n","    while stack:\n","        vertex = stack.pop()\n","        if vertex not in visited:\n","            visited.add(vertex)\n","            stack.extend(graph[vertex] - visited)\n","\n","    return visited\n","```\n","In this code, `graph` is a dictionary where each key is a node and the corresponding value is a set of nodes that can be reached from the key. `start` is the node where the search begins.\n","\n","**Mathematical Explanation:**\n","\n","DFS is a graph traversal algorithm that uses a stack data structure.
