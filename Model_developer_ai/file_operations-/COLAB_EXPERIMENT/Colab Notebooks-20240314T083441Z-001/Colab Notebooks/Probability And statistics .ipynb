Interpretations of Probability\n","\n","Probability can be interpreted in two primary ways:\n","\n","- **Frequentist Interpretation**: This interpretation defines an event's probability as the limit of its relative frequency in a large number of trials. If an experiment is repeated under identical conditions, the probability of an event is the ratio of the number of times the event occurs to the total number of trials. Mathematically, if an event $$E$$ occurs $$m$$ times in $$n$$ trials, the probability $$P(E)$$ is given by:\n","\n","    $$P(E) = \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\frac{m}{n}$$\n","\n","- **Bayesian Interpretation**: This interpretation considers probability as a measure of belief or confidence in the occurrence of an event. It allows for personal judgment and subjective factors to influence the calculation of probabilities.\n","\n","## 2. Experiments and Events\n","\n","An **experiment** is a procedure that yields one of a given set of outcomes. An **event** is the outcome of an experiment. For example, tossing a coin is an experiment, and getting a head or a tail is an event.\n","\n","## 3. Set Theory\n","\n","Set theory is a branch of mathematical logic that studies sets, which are collections of objects. In the context of probability, a **set** is a collection of possible outcomes or events. Each outcome or event is an **element** of the set.\n","\n","## 4. Definition of Probability\n","\n","Probability measures the likelihood of an event occurring. It is a value between 0 and 1, inclusive. A probability of 0 indicates that the event will not occur, and a probability of 1 indicates that the event is certain to occur. Mathematically, the probability $$P(E)$$ of an event $$E$$ is defined as:\n","\n","$$P(E) = \\frac{\\text{Number of favorable outcomes}}{\\text{Total number of outcomes}}$$\n","\n","## 5. Finite Sample Spaces\n","\n","A **sample space** is the set of all possible outcomes of an experiment. If the sample space consists of a finite number of outcomes, it is called a **finite sample space**.\n","\n","## 6. Counting Methods\n","\n","Counting methods, such as the multiplication principle, permutations, and combinations, are used to count the number of ways an event can occur without actually listing all the possibilities.\n","\n","## 7. Combinatorial Methods\n","\n","Combinatorial methods are used to count or enumerate the number of ways that certain patterns can be formed. The two most common combinatorial methods are **permutations** and **combinations**.\n","\n","## 8. Multinomial Coefficients\n","\n","The multinomial coefficient, also known as the combination with repetition, is the number of ways to divide a multiset of $$n$$ items into $$k$$ distinct non-empty subsets. It is given by the formula:\n","\n","$$\\binom{n}{k_1, k_2, ..., k_m} = \\frac{n!}{k_1! k_2! ... k_m!}$$\n","\n","where $$k_1 + k_2 + ... + k_m = n$$.\n","\n","## 9.

Definition of Conditional Probability\n","\n","Conditional probability is the probability of an event given that another event has occurred. If we have two events, A and B, the conditional probability of A given B is denoted as P(A|B). It's calculated as:\n","\n","$$P(A|B) = \\frac{P(A \\cap B)}{P(B)}$$\n","\n","This equation states that the probability of event A given event B is equal to the probability of A and B occurring together divided by the probability of B.\n","\n","## 2. Independent Events\n","\n","Two events A and B are independent if the occurrence of A does not affect the occurrence of B, and vice versa. For independent events, the probability of both events occurring is the product of the probabilities of each event. Mathematically, this is expressed as:\n","\n","$$P(A \\cap B) = P(A)P(B)$$\n","\n","## 3. Bayes’ Theorem\n","\n","Bayes' theorem describes the probability of an event based on prior knowledge of conditions that might be related to the event. If we have two events A and B, the theorem is stated mathematically as:\n","\n","$$P(A|B) = \\frac{P(B|A)P(A)}{P(B)}$$\n","\n","This equation means that the probability of A given B is equal to the probability of B given A times the probability of A, all divided by the probability of B.\n","\n","## 4. The Gambler’s Ruin Problem\n","\n","The gambler's ruin problem is a mathematical concept that deals with the probability of a gambler going broke. Suppose a gambler with k dollars, and his opponent has n-k dollars. They play a fair game repeatedly, in which the gambler wins one dollar with probability p and loses one dollar with probability q=1-p. The gambler is ruined if he loses all his money. The probability that the gambler will eventually be ruined, Pₖ, is:\n","\n","$$Pₖ = \\left(\\frac{1-(q/p)ᵏ}{1-(q/p)ⁿ}\\right)$$\n","\n","if p ≠ q, and\n","\n","$$Pₖ = \\frac{k}{n}$$\n","\n","if p = q = 0.5.\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"qx2gHVFd0qKB"},"source":["\n","\n","## 1. Random Variables and Discrete Distributions\n","\n","A random variable is a variable whose possible values are numerical outcomes of a random phenomenon. There are two types of random variables, discrete and continuous.\n","\n","A discrete random variable is one which may take on only a countable number of distinct values such as 0,1,2,3,4,... etc. Probability mass function (PMF) is a function that gives the probability that a discrete random variable is exactly equal to some value.

Continuous Distributions\n","\n","A continuous random variable is one which takes an infinite number of possible values. Continuous random variables are usually measurements. Examples include height, weight, the amount of sugar in an orange, the time required to run a mile.\n","\n","A continuous random variable is not defined at specific values. Instead, it is defined over an interval of values, and is represented by the area under a curve (in advanced mathematics, this is known as an integral). The probability density function (PDF) is used to specify the probability of the random variable falling within a particular range of values.\n","\n","If X is a continuous random variable, we define the PDF of X at x to be:\n","\n","$$f(x) = F'(x)$$\n","\n","where F is the cumulative distribution function.\n","\n","## 3.

The model requires a finite set of states with fixed conditional probabilities of moving from one state to another¹.\n","\n","GPT-3.5 is a fine-tuned version of GPT-3, a large-scale language model that can generate natural language or code based on the input. GPT-3.5 is based on the decoder architecture of the Transformer, which uses self-attention mechanisms to process input sequences and generate output sequences². GPT-3.5 has three variants, each with 1.3B, 6B, and 175B parameters. The main feature of GPT-3.5 is to eliminate toxic output to a certain extent².\n","\n","The flow of GPT-3.5 can be described as follows:\n","\n","- The input sequence is tokenized into subwords and encoded into embeddings, which are numerical representations of the tokens.\n","- The embeddings are passed through a positional encoding layer, which adds information about the order of the tokens in the sequence.\n","- The encoded sequence is fed into a stack of decoder blocks, each consisting of a masked multi-head self-attention layer and a feed-forward layer. The self-attention layer allows the model to learn the dependencies and relationships between the tokens in the input and output sequences. The feed-forward layer applies a non-linear transformation to the output of the self-attention layer.\n","- The output of the last decoder block is passed through a linear layer and a softmax layer, which produce a probability distribution over the vocabulary for each token in the output sequence.\n","- The model generates the output sequence by sampling from the probability distribution, using a decoding strategy such as greedy decoding, beam search, or top-k sampling.\n","\n","The flow of GPT-3.5 can be compared to a stochastic process, as it involves randomness and uncertainty in the generation of the output sequence. However, unlike a Markov chain, GPT-3.5 does not have a fixed set of states or transition probabilities, and it can learn from the entire input sequence, not just the previous state. Therefore, GPT-3.5 can be considered as a more complex and powerful stochastic process than a Markov chain..\n","\n","\n","- (1) [OpenAI Platform](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/gpt-3-5.)\n","- (2) [GPT-3.5 model architecture - OpenGenus IQ. ](https://iq.opengenus.org/gpt-3-5-model/.)\n","- (3) [GPT-2 vs GPT-3 vs GPT-3.5 vs GPT-4: A Comprehensive ... - OpenGenus IQ.]( https://iq.opengenus.org/gpt2-vs-gpt3-vs-gpt35-vs-gpt4/.)\n","- (4) [GPT-3 vs GPT-3.5: Key Differences and Applications - Iffort. ](https://www.iffort.com/blog/2023/03/31/gpt-3-vs-gpt-3-5/.)\n","- (5) [Build a Deep Learning Tex](https://www.educative.io/blog/deep-learning-text-generation-markov-chains.)\n","- (6) [Markov Chain - GeeksforGeeks.](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/markov-chain/.)\n","- (7) [Markov Chain Definition | DeepAI. ](https://deepai.org/machine-learning-glossary-and-terms/markov-chain.)\n","- (8) [Markov Chain in Neural Network - OpenGenus IQ.]( https://iq.opengenus.org/markov-chain-in-neural-network/.)\n","- (9) [en.wikipedia.org.]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain.)"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"gjFaQceeyCyl"},"outputs":[],"source":[]}],"metadata":{"colab":{"authorship_tag":"ABX9TyMve1gRhdDeBnNGJP/2nQDs","provenance":[]},"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"name":"python"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":0}
