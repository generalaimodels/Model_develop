It provides improved compression efficiency and video quality, enabling smaller file sizes and better playback performance over limited bandwith connections, particularly for high-resolution and HDR video content.\n","\n","In detail:\n","\n","1.) Higher compression efficiency: H.265 can compress video files to half the size of H.264 while maintaining the same video quality, allowing for smaller file sizes and lower bandwidth usage. The biggest contributing factors for the higher compression efficiency is the use of coding tree units instead of macroblocks and improved motion compensation and spatial prediction.\n","\n","2.) Improved image quality: H.265 uses advanced compression techniques that result in improved image quality while producing smaller file sizes, particularly for high-resolution and high-dynamic-range (HDR) video content.\n","\n","3.) Improved support for 4K and 8K video: H.265 is better suited to handle the high-resolution requirements of 4K and 8K video, making it a popular choice for video content in these formats.\n","\n","One disadvantage of H.256 is the higher computational demand.\n","\n","-----Predicted Answer-----\n","\n","H.265 is a new video coding standard that was developed by the Joint Collaborative Team on Video Coding (JCT-VC) of the International Telecommunication Union (ITU-T) and the International Organization for Standardization (ISO). H.265 is designed to be more efficient than H.264, which is the current standard for video compression.\n","\n","The main advantages of H.265 over H.264 are:\n","\n","1. Higher compression ratio: H.265 has a higher compression ratio than H.264. This means that H.265 can encode more data per second than H.264.\n","\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["### Inference and prompting\n","\n","You can also load the trained model and manually prompt it."],"metadata":{"id":"V25WLegEWkxK"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["!pipenv run python prompt.py --e output/demo_oasst-data/"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"9Zq41w1oN__x","outputId":"9daf305b-d66d-4a23-dc6a-bf68e3bcf5d6","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1681891929326,"user_tz":-120,"elapsed":34754,"user":{"displayName":"Philipp Singer","userId":"09198034459230039277"}}},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["\n","===================================BUG REPORT===================================\n","Welcome to bitsandbytes.
