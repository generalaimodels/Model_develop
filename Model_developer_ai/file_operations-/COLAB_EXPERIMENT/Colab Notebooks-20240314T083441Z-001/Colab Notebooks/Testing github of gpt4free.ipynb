Here's a step-by-step guide on how you might develop an advanced RAG system:\n","\n","1. **Understand the model**: Before starting any development, understanding the model is key. RAG combines the benefits of retriever-based models (which use sparse retrieval) and seq2seq generator models (which generate answers).\n","\n","2. **Data Collection and Management**: Collect a diverse set of question-answer pairs. In RAG's case, Facebook used data collected from game dialogs and a subset of the Wikipedia database.\n","\n","3. **Preprocessing the data**: Transform the data in a form that's suitable for the model. This might involve techniques like tokenization, stemming, and creating word embeddings.\n","\n","4. **Building the Retriever**: The retriever is integral to RAG. This component scans the database and retrieves relevant documents. This helps the model avoid searching the entire parameter space of the seq2seq model, scaling the modelâ€™s effective capacity.\n","\n","5. **Building the Sequence Generator**: The seq2seq model accepts as input the question concatenated with the retrieved documents. It's trained to minimize the negative log-likelihood of the answer.\n","\n","6. **Combine both elements**: The retriever and the seq2seq models are trained independently at first. Once they are both trained, RAG model is formed by merging them.\n","\n","7. **Train the combined model**: You'd adjust the parameters of the retriever and the generator to improve the system's overall performance.\n","\n","8. **Testing the model**: Like any other machine learning model, testing is to ensure the model performs as per the expectations. If not, return to earlier steps and refine the model.\n","\n","9. **Deployment of the model**: Once satisfactorily tested, this model can be deployed to assist in any text-based question answering system."],"metadata":{"id":"kuGBTfJCpC6Z"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["! python /content/gpt4free/etc/testing/test_all.py"],"metadata":{"id":"LZd6fYWm5nxm"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["import glob\n","import os\n","\n","# Specify the directory path where your files are located\n","directory = \"/content/gpt4free\"\n","\n","# Specify the output file name\n","output_file = \"output.txt\"\n","\n","# Create a list of file extensions you want to include\n","extensions = [\".md\", \".txt\", \".csv\", \".json\",\".py\"]\n","\n","# Open the output file in write mode\n","with open(output_file, \"w\") as output:\n","    # Iterate through each file with the specified extensions\n","    for extension in extensions:\n","        # Use glob to get a list of files with the current extension\n","        files = glob.glob(os.path.join(directory, \"*\" + extension))\n","\n","        # Iterate through each file and write its content to the output file\n","        for file in files:\n","            with open(file, \"r\") as input_file:\n","                output.write(input_file.read())\n","                output.write(\"\\n\")  # Add a new line after each file's content\n"],"metadata":{"id":"cEt99fbpxZRv"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["ls"],"metadata":{"id":"uBVh7sOLxjjy"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["!cat  output.txt"],"metadata":{"id":"1q4dvoY8xmlG"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["!pwd"],"metadata":{"id":"j2nlbXZWxbfQ"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["!cd ..\n","!ls\n"],"metadata":{"id":"5D_-4BDcishW"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["!cd .."],"metadata":{"id":"gH6PSk9jqyHL"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["ls"],"metadata":{"id":"7Lpw4dAOq03C"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["!python /content/gpt4free/etc/testing/_providers.py\n","!python /content/gpt4free/etc/testing/log_time.py\n","!python /content/gpt4free/etc/testing/test_api.py\n","!python /content/gpt4free/etc/testing/test_async.py\n","!python /content/gpt4free/etc/testing/test_chat_completion.py\n","# !python /content/gpt4free/etc/testing/test_gui.py\n","!python /content/gpt4free/etc/testing/test_interference.py\n","!python /content/gpt4free/etc/testing/test_providers.py"],"metadata":{"id":"QXjYO5jkrAq8"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
